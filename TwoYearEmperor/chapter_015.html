Albrecht let us stew for a minute, smiling the whole time, then picked
up the conversational ball again.  "In any case, to answer your
question more completely, we came here in order to discuss our mutual
goals and see if we couldn't arrive at some agreement that would
beneft everyone.  Would you please join us?"  Behind him, two of his
warrior bodyguards dropped a Portable Hole on the ground, jumped in,
and hoisted out a two-person table, two chairs, and a full dinner
service including linen table cloth, crystal goblets, and four
mirror-polished silver chafing dishes on a cherrywood side table.  The
food in the chafing dishes was clearly still hot, as I could see wisps
of steam escaping from them.
</p>

<p>
Ok, really?  This man looked like a slightly slimmer Santa Claus,
talked like a well-educated fanboy, conquered half of the country,
slaughtered tens of thousands&mdash;if not hundreds of
thousands&mdash;of people, and now he suddenly appeared out of nowhere
and invited me to a fancy sit-down breakfast in the middle of my own
capital?  Yet again, this universe was on the express track for
Crazytown.  (And, on that subject, exactly when had I started thinking
of it as "my" capital, anyway?)
</p> 

<p>
Thomas and I entered into a very rapid discussion that consisted
entirely of looking at each other and some minor shrugs and grimaces.
Had anyone had a "Comprehend Language (Body)" running at the time we
probably would have sounded something like this: "So, I guess I should
sit down?" "It's a trap!" "First, you aren't nearly squiddy enough to
say that.  Second, sure, of course it is.  But, the Land."  "Argh.
Fine, I still can't argue with that.  I don't like it, but I can't
argue with it."  "So I should sit down?" "...Sure.  Fine, whatever.
Just don't come crying to me when the pain and blood and death and
pain start."
</p>

<p>
Carefully, I sat in the chair opposite Albrecht.  <em>My</em>
bodyguard formed up behind me, weapons drawn.  <em>His</em> bodyguard
spread out behind him, weapons drawn, forming a loose circle and
facing in all directions.  The Cuirassiers spread out to surround both
groups, standing back about twenty feet in two ranks.  Both sets of
bodyguards glared across the table at their opposite numbers.</p>

<p>One of his people, without ever ceasing to glower at us, removed
the covers from the chafing dishes.  My nose was immediately assaulted
by the scent of fresh baked bread seemingly straight from the oven,
blackberries floating in cream and covered in sugar, and&mdash;I kid
you not&mdash;fresh, piping hot omelettes.  How in the hell they had
fresh, hot omelettes when they'd been waiting for at least two hours,
I have no idea. In addition, there were two decanters of juice,
grapefruit and orange, a teapot glazed in swirls of blues and whites,
and a large pitcher of water with ice and slices of lemon.
</p>

<p>
Then they lifted up the lid of the last chafing dish and the delicious
aroma of crispy bacon wafted across the table to me.  <em>Men frying
on the Plaza, dancing like hyperactive marionnetes as their skin
sizzled with the electricity from my generators.</em>  I gagged,
fighting to not toss last night's dinner all over the table.
</p>

<p>
The bubbly little man across from me poured a cup of reddish liquid
from the teapot and extended it across the table to me. "Tea?  We
brought it from Anundj&aring;.  As far as I can tell, you have nothing
like this variety here, and I think you'll like it.  It's made from
biska flowers; light, a bit fruity, with a slight peppery flavor.  I
find it quite delicious.  It's also a bit medicinal&mdash;excellent
for soothing sore throat and bad stomachs."  His lips quirked just
slightly as he said that.
</p>

<p>
It smelled good, hints of peppermint and ginger that promised relief.
I lifted it to my lips and started to gulp it down, but a mailed hand
blocked me.  Looking up at Thomas, I saw him frowning at the ring on
his hand, a greenish cabochon set in a plain steel band.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht smiled widely, looking friendly and amused.  "I beg your
pardon, I should have offered immediately.  Please, Commander, do
check all the food first.  In fact, please sample everything.  There
<em>are</em> such things as binary toxins, after all, which don't
register as poison until mixed.  Oh, and don't forget to check the
flatware and the glasses."
</p>

<p>
Thomas frowned and waved Franklin forward.  (Yes, I can in fact
remember names when the people in question have spent twenty four
hours within an armslength of me.)  Being the junior man present,
apparently it was Franklin's job to throw himself on any food-based
grenades that might come along.
</p>

<p>
The young Landguard quickly ran his ring&mdash;identical to Thomas's;
apparently they were standard issue, like the Haversacks&mdash;over
all the dishes and table accoutrements, then took a bite from each of
the chafing dishes, sampled the various beverages, and ran the ring
over himself.  Whatever the ring was supposed to do in the presence of
poison, it didn't do it.  Finally Thomas stepped back and Franklin
rejoined the ranks.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht had watched all this calmly, continuing to look amused.  Once
the inspection was over, he selected a bit of each item, arranged it
carefully on one of the bone china plates, and passed it across the
table to me.  With a grin, he commented, "You know, if I had wanted
you dead, there are easier ways than bringing myself and a small
bodyguard to your very capital and arranging a pleasant brunch just so
that I could make a hare-brained attempt to slip poison past a
bodyguard as conscientious and effective as the Landguard."
</p>

<p>
I stared glumly at the bacon on the edge of my plate.  <em>~Damnit, I
love bacon.  Bacon is delicious.  This is so unfair.~</em> Even
looking at it made me a bit queasy, so I nudged it carefully off my
plate and covered it with my napkin.  Once it was out of sight and
scent, I gulped down the contents of my teacup and waited for it to
settle my stomach.  Feeling a bit of color come back, I smiled
tentatively.  "Ok, fair point.  But if you don't want me dead, why are
you here?  For that matter, why are you in Flobovia at all?"
</p>

<p>
He took a moment to pour himself a glass of the orange juice, gazed at
it contemplatively for a moment, and took a small sip.  "You're
familiar with the various creatures of this world, of course.  Tell
me, what do shadows, wights, and wraiths have in common?"
</p>

<p>
I frowned.  Riddles?  Well, maybe there was a point.  I flipped
through the Brainopedia, reading up on the three monsters and looking
for commonalities.  There were a lot.
</p>

<p>
"Well...they're all undead, they all drain stats when they hit, and if
they kill you you come back as one of them.  Why?"
</p>

<p>
He took another sip, leaning back in his chair and eyeing me.  "How
are you at multiplication?  Consider the implications."
</p>

<p>
I frowned, not sure where he was going with this.  "Consider the
implications of what?"
</p>

<p>
He sighed, looking vaguely disappointed.  "Think.  A single wight
enters a small village&mdash;say, a hundred farmers or
fisherman&mdash;and begins killing.  What happens?"
</p>

<p>
I thought about it before finally realizing what he meant.  "Holy
crap. The wight kills someone; they come back as a wight.  The two
wights kill two more people.  It's a geometric progression."  The more
I thought about it, the more terrifying it became.
</p>

<p>
Something seemed wrong though; after a moment I had it.  "But that
can't be; if it really worked like that, you couldn't kill them fast
enough to keep up.  The world would have been destroyed long ago.  So
why hasn't it?"
</p>

<p>
His smile became sad.  "It has.  At least seven times that we know of.
On average, it seems to happen roughly every four millenia; the most
recent was forty five hundred years ago, so we're overdue.  Rather,
we <em>were</em> overdue; we aren't anymore.  It's starting again."
</p>

<p>
I frowned.  "That's not possible.  If the undead managed to kill off
all sentient life, how would the situation ever reverse itself?  Even
if any new humans or elves or whatever started to evolve, there would
be hundreds of millions of undead everywhere.  The new lifeforms would
be eliminated immediately, before they could get a toehold.  The fact
that we're having this conversation means that it doesn't work like
that."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but it does."  He lifted his eyes, looking behind me.  "Archmage
Isaac, you are a historian.  How many ancient civilizations are you
aware of that no longer exist?"
</p>

<p>
Isaac's pomposity sounded troubled.  "Six.  The most recent being the
Theocracy of Ainaalacar, which splintered apart fifty-eight hundred
years ago.  The histories say that Ainaalacar fell because 'a darkness
settled in the hearts of all.'  The standard interpretation has always
been that that meant the High Oracle had become selfish and grasping,
if not actually evil, and the lesser lords revolted.  But...there is a
mention in the journal of Sertasil, Third Mage of the Lorekeepers, in
which he talks about a group of adventurers who were hired to destroy
a vampire coven.  Two of the adventurers were lost to the vampires,
and he described it as 'their blood was drained and their hearts
filled with blackest night, and thus they became the scourge they
sought to cleanse.'"
</p>

<p>
There was silence for a long moment; everyone on my side of the table
was shaken.  Even Thomas was looking pale.  Finally I managed to
collect my voice and asked, "So, this brings us back to the original
question.  If the world works like that, why are there still people?
What is it that gets rid of the undead and makes room for sentient
life to evolve again?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht raised an eyebrow.  "Surely you don't believe in evolution,
do you Jake?  Everyone knows that the gods create life."
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.  "No, people evolved from...ah, crap."  It dawned on
me that, in this screwed-up world, people might <em>actually</em> have
been sculpted from the dust by the hand of an actual invisible sky
daddy, who really did want people to set bovine giblets on fire in
order to venerate him.
</p>

<p>
"Fine, the gods create people.  So, your implication is that they also
periodically destroy all the people and start over.  Is it always
undead?"
</p>

<p>
"Not always, no.  In Anundj&aring; we have records of a flood, a
plague of demons, an 'eternal' winter, a curtain of fire, and three
risings of the drauga&mdash;what you call the undead."
</p>

<p>
I rubbed my eyes tiredly. "Ok, fine.  So every few thousand years, the
gods push the reset button.  And I guess in the meantime they work to
keep things from blowing up?  They limit the numbers of the undead and
so on?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht nodded.  "Exactly.  We don't understand what causes them to
go from protecting the world to destroying it, but it seems to happen
regularly.  The oddest thing is that even while they are destroying
all life, they continue to grant power to their chosen
ones&mdash;clerics, paladins, and so on.  Divine spells continue to be
available, the power to turn undead continues to work, etc.  It makes
no sense, but it is so.  There are any number of theories in my
country to explain it, each wilder than the last.  The truth is that
no one knows."
</p>

<p>
The Archpriest had finally had all he could take.  "This is nonsense!
Why would the Lord of Light allow this to happen?  He is a loving god,
and would never seek to destroy his children."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht flashed him a sardonic smile.  "History would suggest
otherwise, Your Benevolence."
</p>

<p>
I decided to intercept that conversation before it went too far off
the rails.  "Ok, let's assume for the sake of argument that you're
right.  The gods periodically wipe out all life and then start over,
for whatever reason.  What does that have to do with us, right now?
With why you're here, slaughtering your way across Flobovia?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht shrugged. "I should think it obvious.  The world is about to
be destroyed; all peoples must stand united and work smoothly together
in order to prevent it.  The Union of Anundj&aring; has been striving
to hold back the darkness for over a hundred and fifty years now.  At
first, we tried to work in concert with our neighbors; that failed.
One after another there was too much resistance; nobles and rulers too
proud to do what was necessary if it meant giving up any control or
any of their prerogatives.  About ninety years ago, three of the
nations adjoining us fell to the drauga; Anundj&aring; depended on
exports from those countries for food and certain metals, so we had to
send in the legions to reclaim the land and push back the enemy
hordes.  We lost millions in the fighting.  In the end, we were
stretched too thin and the shadows broke through, destroying large
sections of Anundj&aring;.  We barely managed to beat them back before
we lost everything.  Since then, we've simply brought other nations
under our control so that we could coordinate more effectively.  We
generally don't care too much about local governance as long as our
orders are met promptly and efficiently.  It's worked well so far;
since we started this policy, we've held the line against the drauga
and even reclaimed some ground."
</p>

<p>
He paused, gauging our reaction.  "Of course, that's all predicated on
having the troops.  You killed over twenty thousand legionnaires in
one attack.  Many of our records were destroyed in the strike, so
identifying all those killed is proving time consuming; so far we've
only managed to bring back&mdash;how many was it, Joss?"
</p>

<p>
One of the clerics behind him answered without inflection.  "Four
thousand, seven hundred and twenty four as of this morning, High
Marshal."
</p>

<p>
He nodded, "Yes, just so.  Thank you, Joss."  Turning back to us, he
continued.  "As I was saying, it's been two whole days and we haven't
even resurrected a quarter of those killed.  We probably won't have
the rest back on their feet for another four or five days, which is
terribly embarrassing; back home, the High Command is receiving angry
missives left and right from the families of those who are still
waiting for resurrection, and they're passing the misery on to me
multiple times a day."  He paused for another sip of juice and a
delicate bite of his omelette; his lips were still smiling, but his
eyes glittered with calculation.  "As much as I admire the ingenuity
of your tactic, it's been awfully inconvenient; the amount of
paperwork I'm having to handle is simply astounding.  That's why I
thought I should come here and have this little talk."
</p>

<p>
We all stared at him in shock.  We had wiped out the population of a
large town, and he considered it "inconvenient"?</p>
