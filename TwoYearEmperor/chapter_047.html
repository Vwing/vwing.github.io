<p>
Colborn turned to me, mouth hanging open in shock.
</p>

<p>
"..." he said.
</p>

<p>
I smiled.
</p>

<p>
"...but..." he tried again.
</p>

<p>
I decided to take pity on him.  "I forgive you your debt, Colborn," I
told him respectfully.  "You are a Master High Mage of Anundj&aring;;
you should not have to embarrass yourself like that. I would very much
appreciate your help with this campaign, if you're willing?"  I paused
and grinned, inviting him to join in the laughter.  "Although, if
you <em>wanted</em> to tell some people 'Jake was right!' I wouldn't
mind."
</p>

<p>
His mouth clopped shut; he stared a moment, then gave a jerky nod.
"Thank you," he managed to say.
</p>

<p>
I clapped him on the shoulder.  "Now, I suspect you're tired of being
human and would prefer to go back to your original form.  It'll have
to wait until we're back at Gr&#491;fhamr, I'm afraid, Polymorph can't
turn a human into an undead, Mage Jary here isn't high enough level
for Polymorph Any Object, and Albrecht told me before we came that he
didn't have it prepared. Anyway, let's get back and we'll get you
fixed up."
</p>

<p>
Colborn shook his head.  "No reason to waste a Polymorph Any Other
when I can just do it myself," he said.  I started to ask what he
meant, but before I could get the words out he drew his dagger.
Without a moment's hesitation, he rammed the needle-like point up
through the soft underside of his jaw, jamming it into his brain and
killing himself instantly.  His body collapsed in a flacid heap on my
feet.
</p>

<p>
"Urgh!" I yowled, jumping back in horror.
</p>

<p>
The body shimmered; the teeth elongated into fangs, the muscles filled
out, the potbelly retreated into nothing.  A moment later Colborn
opened red-pupiled eyes, reached up, and yanked the dagger out of his
head.  The wound in his jaw sealed itself over in an instant, and he
climbed back to his feet, brushing the dust off his robes.
</p>

<p>
"What?" he asked, looking confused at my gaping expression.  "Everyone
knows that if you're killed while Polymorphed, you revert to your
original form.  Still dead, of course, but then again...I'm already
dead."  He gave me a fang-baring grin and turned to Jary.  "Shall we
go?"
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
"Thiph if amaphing," said Master Sage Einarr, wolfing a mouthful of
pastry.  He took a gulp from his tankard&mdash;it was intended to hold
ale, but he had filled it with sixteen ounces of a remarkably good red
wine.  
</p>

<p>
Einarr chomped down the last bite of his delicious flaky-crusted
meatpie, glorying in the it's-not-created-protein-glop flavor of it.
Even while he chewed, he was reaching for a fresh, juicy apple; the
moment his mouth was clear he took a huge bite.  The crisp snap! of it
was audible around the table.
</p>

<p>
I smiled, topping off my own tankard from what I was starting to call
the "Everful Bottle of Liquid Perfection, +27 Bazillion."  I drew in a
breath of its heady Scotch bite, then took a good long pull.  It went
down like an amazingly inappropriate simile and I could feel its warm
glow reddening my face.  I took another sip, savoring the perfection
of it.
</p>

<p>
Colborn sat across the table from me, next to Albrecht.  He eyed our
food and booze and looked glum...and a little nauseous.  "I remember
enjoying food and alcohol," he said sadly.  "Now all I can eat is
blood and, honestly, the smell of all this stuff is making me queasy.
I don't suppose you could put it away, could you?"
</p>

<p>
Einarr shook his head and reached for a hunk of chocolate cake with
his left hand while shoving another bite of the apple in with his
right.  "Noph," he mumbled around the cake that was now half in and
half <em>on</em> his mouth.  
</p>

<p>
Albrecht smiled.  "I'm afraid the Master Sage has spoken, grandnephew.
You will have to, ah, 'cope and deal', as Jake says."  He smiled in
amusement as he watched Einarr pack away the
calories. (<em>Another</em> bit of unfairness!  Stupidworlders had no
connection between calories and weight.  They could eat bon-bons and
fudge ripple ice cream all day and not gain a pound.  Bastards.)  "In
fairness, this is the first decent meal he's had in six years." He
took a sip from his wine goblet, savoring it for a moment.  "Also, to
be honest, I'm enjoying it myself.  We ate well in Flobovia, but I was
back here so much that I was eating glop four meals out of seven."
</p>

<p>
That surprised me.  "Why were you back here so much?  And, for that
matter, how?  When we all teleported in, the place was totally
invested with undead."  I winced a little as I said that, pushing the
images aside.  I took a pull on my tankard, focusing on the perfect
rasp of the alcohol as a distraction from the thoughts of burning and
dying friends, living corpses, pain, torture...I shook it away and
took another slug.
</p>

<p>
He shrugged.  "Until recently we were located elsewhere, up around the
northwest corner of Nordfjall.  That's where I was going to and from."
He paused to take a delicate bite of the crispy, flaky shepherd's
pie&mdash;lots of minced beef, carrots, celery, onions, garlic,
ginger, hints of spices, all cooked in a red wine sauce with a heavy
layer of mashed potatoes and cheese over the top. "A few days before
you and I came here, a patrol of undead stumbled over us; pure bad
luck as far as we can tell, but that doesn't matter.  Anyway, we had
to move.  We hadn't found a new location yet, so we were forced to
fall back on Snorri's cavern.  Afi found it years ago; we just didn't
expect him to still be keeping an eye on it.  Shortly after
Gr&#491;fhamr moved, he must have heard that we were back and deployed
one of his Legions on it."  He took a nibble of the chocolate cake,
then added, "We're actually quite lucky we came in when we did.  Most
likely, Afi would have attacked the next day and Gr&#491;fhamr might
well have been captured or destroyed.  He wouldn't have deployed such
a large contingent unless he had figured a way around the Celestial
Brilliance fence."
</p>

<p>
The idea of the undead flooding into Gr&#491;fhamr&mdash;possibly into
this very <em>room</em>&mdash;spiked through my brain. My
unfortunately perfect recall dredged up the weight of the Landguard
head that had bounced off my back, the feel of the wight tearing my
ribs open and sucking the life out of me, the smell of rotting corpses
everywhere that <em>were still attacking us</em>, the sight of chunks
of Franklin's face and arms being ripped off even as he fought...
</p>

<p>
A strangled cry ripped its way out of me as I shoved myself back in my
chair.  My chest heaved in fast, shallow gasps, my heart was pounding
so hard I thought it would smash through my ribs; cold, clammy sweat
burst out over my entire body, making me feel like I'd fallen under
the ice on a river.  The world went sparkly and white around me as I
folded into my chair, pulling my knees up under my chin, hiding my
face and whimpering like a lost child.
</p>

<p>
"Calm Emotions," Duncan declared flatly.
</p>

<p>
I sat up, took a bite of one of the pastries, and had a slug of
Scotch.  "Thanks Duncan, that's much better," I commented.  Turning
back to my Strategos, I followed up.  "Albrecht, I meant to
ask&mdash;you were conquering all our towns and villages and leaving
detachments behind to run them.  How did that work if you only had a
few thousand soldiers?"
</p>

<p>
Everyone was staring at me as though I'd grown an extra head.
</p>

<p>
"What was that?" Thomas asked, confused.  "You looked like you'd just
been hit by a Fear spell."
</p>

<p>
I shrugged, all concern walled away behind the magic glass wall of
Duncan's spell. "Panic attack, I guess.  Anyway, I'm fine now.
Although, it would probably be good to make sure there's always a few
Landguard on hand with that Calm Emotions spell.  Albrecht, you were
saying?"
</p>

<p>
"You realize this only lasts a few rounds, right?" Duncan grated.
"And only as long as I'm concentrating?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh," I responded.  "Hm.  Well, that may prove to be awkward.  I
suppose we'll have to find a better solution then.  Don't know what
that might be, but I'll think about it."  I paused, spinning a few
ideas around, but nothing seemed to click. After a bit I gave up.  "Ah
well," I shrugged.  "I'll just have to deal with it as it comes.  If
it gets too bad you can always use Calm Emotions to help me through
the worst of it.  Anyway, where were we?"  I took another sip of my
Scotch, enjoying the rich and heady scent.
</p>

<p>
Silence reigned for a long moment.  "What are 'panic attacks'?" Thomas
inquired cautiously.
</p>

<p>
I sighed, shaking my head. "Of <em>course</em> you don't have those
here. For you people, fear is just a bloody status effect.  Grr."  I
pondered the unfairness of it all, then explained.  "Panic attacks are
a response that real people have to traumatic events.  Symptoms are
heart palpitations, tremors, difficulty breathing...basically,
panic. Anyway, they'll probably keep happening."  I thought back,
dredging up the few facts about the condition that I'd read online,
mostly out of curiousity after it was mentioned on a favorite TV show.
"Let's see...best treatment is cognitive behavior therapy, which I
doubt anyone in this world knows squat about.  I don't suppose you
have any benzodiazepines, do you?  No?  Yeah, didn't think so.  Hm.  I
think aversion therapy had some success, maybe we could try that?
Hm."
</p>

<p>
After a few more moments of unsuccessful thought, I shrugged.  "Let's
get back to work," I continued.  "Albrecht, you were saying?" I poured
down a long gulp of Scotch to help burn up the few traces of concern
that were leaking around the Calm Emotions and distracting me.  It
worked so well that I sent another after it as reinforcements.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht studied me for a moment before continuing, but clearly
decided to let it lie for now. "We conquered the population centers
mostly so that we could have free run of their libraries and reference
materials, as part of the search for Herr&uacute;n's temple," he
offered.  "And, secondarily, to lend credence to the idea that we were
the powerful invading force that I was framing us as."  He paused for
a bite of cake before continuing.  "After we reduced Oxport and Tor
Canle"&mdash;Thomas's mouth tightened&mdash;"the rest were eager to
surrender, so we didn't have to fight for them.  We immediately
shipped their armed forces back to Anundj&aring; and left a small
detachment of our own people behind to rule.  Usually just half a
dozen or so, to serve as administrators, but we created a permanent
Teleportation Circle leading to each town.  I had two companies
dedicated to constantly shifting through the various Circles and
marching around, making it look as though we'd left significant forces
in each place.  We were careful to treat the inhabitants
well&mdash;plenty of medical care, education, fair legal
enforcement&mdash;and integration started pretty quickly."  He
shrugged apologetically.  "It's pretty standard practice in such
situations; we've been dealing with province management for hundreds
of years.  There are standard drills for this kind of thing."
</p>

<p>
I frowned.  "How could you create a permanent Teleportation Circle to
each town?  You were moving around constantly."  My words seemed to
come from a little ways away, shielded from me by a warm soft fog.  It
was nice.
</p>

<p>
He shrugged.  "A Teleportation Circle can be inscribed on any
surface...including a tarpaulin.  All you have to do is put it on the
tarp and then you can fold it up and carry it with you.  That's how we
usually do them, for exactly that reason."
</p>

<p>
We all stared at him as he casually rewrote warfare and then casually
ate a bite of blueberry pie.
</p>

<p>
After a moment, I shook it off. "Ah...ok.  So. We wiped out a Legion
of Afi's troops," I nodded to Colborn and he gave me a smile and a nod
in return; the smile was a bit tight-lipped, but at least he
appreciated the humor.  "We've got a store set up here so that
everyone can get decent food.  I brought a lot of the Flobovian
archives and spell library back, along with the stuff we copied from
Herr&uacute;n's temple." I grinned and nodded to Suze where she sat
slightly behind me.  "And, of course, my inimitable and lovely
assistant, who categorically refused to be left behind.  Anyone ever
tell you you're scary when you're determined, Suze?" I asked, teasing.
</p>

<p>
She blushed and looked at where her hands were twisting in her lap,
but I could see a tiny little smile of pride.  "You told me before
that you needed my help, M'Lord."  She paused, and then continued in a
very small voice.  "And...I've never been outside the city before.  I
wanted to see what it was like."  
</p>

<p>
The Landguard chuckled&mdash;I'm sure that part of it was pride in how
Suze, who had become something of a mascot for them, was finally
coming out of her shell.  I'm also sure that another part of it was at
the memory of Suze refusing to be left behind, up to the point of
standing in the doorway with her arms folded and a mulish look on her
face, arguing with me about why she needed to come and wagging her
finger at me in determination.  At the time, I could tell that she was
nervous and would probably have crumbled if I'd really pushed it, but
I just couldn't say no to that face.  And besides, it was good to see
her finally developing some self-confidence; I didn't want to crush
her first ever attempt at being assertive...no matter how much she
looked like a growling puppy.
</p>

<p>
"And see things you shall, my oh-so-fierce memory maiden," I promised,
lofting my mug high in a toast.  Everyone joined me and we all gulped
a bit of our various drinks in congratulations.  Suze blushed tomato
red and looked at her lap, shoulders hunched in pleased embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
I relented from teasing her any further and went back to my prior
thought.  "Let's see...Legion destroyed, store established, documents
and spell library brought back...." I smiled secretively.  "And, of
course, my little surprise is ready and waiting.  You assigned the
apprentice magi to take care of it, right?"  I waited for Albrecht's
nod before continuing.  "Ok, I think that takes care of all the old
business.  What's next on the hit parade?"  I took another long pull
on my Scotch; <em>god</em> that was good.  I needed to send a personal
thank you to Arros for letting me keep the bottle.  I sighed, awash in
delight at my full belly, the hint of warm Scotch fog, and the company
of smart people.  Even in the middle of a war, life could be good.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht was clearly becoming accustomed to my incomprehensible
idioms, because he shrugged it off and stayed on track.  "Next is
resurrecting Herr&uacute;n; Master Sage, perhaps you could fill us
in?"
</p>

<p>
Einarr froze like a deer in headlights.  He had a drumstick in one
hand, a piece of cake in the other, and a slightly guilty look on his
face as he finally recognized his ill-mannered gluttony.
</p>

<p>
"Mmph," he mumbled, setting down the chicken and cake and washing his
mouthful down with some wine.  He wiped his face and hands clean on
his napkin and gave a little sigh&mdash;half contentment, half regret
at not getting to finish the cake.
</p>

<p>
"Right, yes," he began, fiddling nervously with his glasses.  "I've
been through the records that His Majesty brought back
from...Flobovia." He forced the name out with a bit of pained
disbelief that any country could have such a ridiculous
appellation. "I think we're going to have some difficulty," he
continued nervously.
</p>

<p>
It was at that moment that the Calm Emotions spell ran out and the
panic stabbed for me again with pointy, razor-sharp claws.  The claws
stabbed into the nice warm fog of happiness that I was basking in, got
lost, and decided to go grab a drink instead of bothering with me.  I
smiled loosely and settled back, feeling a little disconnected from
everything, in a pleasantly hazy sort of way.
</p>

<p>
"The problem," Einarr continued.  "Is that the Lady of Secrets
is <em>dead</em>&mdash;at least, as far as we can tell.  It's not a
question of strengthening her with worship, we need to reinstantiate
her consciousness, rebuild her ability to manifest.  And that's going
to require...sacrifice. A lot of sacrifice."
</p>

<p>
Everyone at the table shifted nervously.
</p>

<p>
"Are we talking human sacrifice...?" Thomas asked uncomfortably.
</p>

<p>
Einarr looked appalled and shook his head fiercely.  "No no no!  What
would the goddess of knowledge and secrets want with death?  No, that
wouldn't do her any good at all.  People need to sacrifice their
secrets to her.  Permanently."
</p>

<p>
We all stared at him in confusion.    
</p>

<p>
He seemed frustrated by our lack of comprehension. "It's simple," he
said impatiently.  "We need to get as many people as possible to pick
one&mdash;preferably more&mdash;of their secrets and sacrifice it to
her.  It has to be something that is actually a secret, and that
benefits the person, either by staying a secret or by being revealed.
For example, a chef might give up the secret recipe to his most
popular dish.  A young man might give up the fact that he is in love
with a particular girl but hasn't had the nerve to tell her.  A
general might give up a secret attack plan."  His eyes slid to me.  "A
man from another world might give up his memory of his wife, or his
children."
</p>

<p>
He paused to study each of us in turn; we all looked nervous and
uncomfortable, even Thomas.  "It isn't a hard process.  You simply
write your secret down and drop it into a fire that burns atop her
altar, offering a short and simple prayer.  Something like 'Lady of
Secrets, take my secret unto thee.'  The paper burns and the secret is
gone, giving her its strength.  The more important the secret, the
better."
</p>

<p>
I frowned blurrily.  "Whut d'you mean, 'the secret is gone'?  How can
a secret be gone?"
</p>

<p>
"She will take it unto Herself.  The person making the sacrifice will
no longer remember it; I can't tell if they will even remember what
the secret was about, or if they'll even remember making the
sacrifice.  She might render the act of sacrifice itself a secret."
</p>

<p>
"If they need to be significant secrets, then this could be a
problem," Albrecht mused.  "But I suppose I could write it down and
review the copy afterwards...?"
</p>

<p>
Einarr was shaking his head firmly.  "No.  That's the point&mdash;it's
a <em>sacrifice.</em>  If you have a way to recover the secret then it
isn't a sacrifice.  That would probably actually hurt her instead of
helping. And we'll only get one shot at this; a divine resurrection is
a onetime thing.  Right now, the last fragments of her being are
drifting around the multiverse on the aetheric winds.  This ritual
will pull them all together and allow them to coalesce back into a
conscious entity...but the pull that brings them together will also
shred them; if there is insufficient power to bind them together, then
they will disperse again, but this time in such tiny fragments that
they could never be restored."
</p>

<p>
We all sat quietly, digesting that.
</p>

<p>
"So, loss of secrets.  Important secres.  And we have to make sure
that the secrets aren't recoverable afterwards," I mused.  "Will, at
least this can be usefl.  If there's anything that we want to be sure
the enemy can't find out, we c'n sacfice that knowledge.  Fr'example,
the current location of Gr&#491;fhamr; have one mage choose the next
location and take it there, then sacrifice the knowledge of where it
is.  The next time we muv, we take care to make sure that the mage
doin' th' muv doesn't know where he's teleporting <em>from</em>."
</p>

<p>
"With respect, Your Majesty," Einarr said, in that exact tone that
conveys no respect at all. "It doesn't work like that.  If you benefit
from the knowledge being destroyed, then it isn't a sacrifice. The
important part is the sacrifice, the choice to give up personal
advantage to aid the Lady."
</p>

<p>
I sighed and took another hit of the Scotch to lubricate my
thoughts. "Well tha' sucks.  Would've been nice if it coulda been
useful, at least."  I fell to muttering about the obnoxiousness of
divinity and how, even when they actually existed, they were nothing
but trouble and how much better off we would be without them.
</p>

<p>
Thomas was eying me with concern.  "Are you all right, Your Majesty?
You may have had a little too much&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I took another belt on my Scotch and smiled at him, a bit blearily.
"'m fine.  Silly Thomas, 'm jus' fine.  Just thinking how to get
everyone to," I paused to organize my thoughts, which had suddenly
become slippery and hard to keep track of. "How to get everyone to
sacfeesh...sacarfice...give up their secres, 'n' make sure no'ne
cheash."  I took another shot of Scotch and waved my finger in the air
to emphasize the great importance of my thinking.  "It is impor-tant,"
I declaimed, taking care to form the syllables correctly, since for
some reason I seemed to have developed a speech impediment.  I paused
to ponder that for a moment, allowing the marvelous might of my
magically modified mental machinery to macerate the conception
completely to create clarity.  "Ha," I laughed, smiling to myself.
"Allirashon'sh cool.  Loves me some allirashun.  Mental mashinry
mazratin', ha.  S'good."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht, Einarr, Thomas, Duncan, Robert, Rob, Bob, Aerith, and Suze
watched as I slid messily off my chair and collapsed, hugging my
lovely bottle to my chest like a teddy bear.  They were quite bemused
as I started snoring and drooling on myself.

<p>
In a society without death, Ingfred is 20 years old and has no
prospects. All the good jobs are filled by undying masters of their
craft, and it's hard to be taken seriously when you are, compared to
everyone around you, an infant.  Fortunately, he has a solution:
undergo an illegal transformation and sell the memory to The
Experiental Herald for a ridiculous sum.
