  <title>The Two Year Emperor</title>
</head>
<body><a href=chapter_001.html>Previous</a><hr />

<p>By the time we got to the sitting room, I had been introduced to
Thomas, commander of the Landguard, and all of his subordinates.  The
names of the junior 'Guards went in one ear and out the other; there
were just too many names too fast to keep track of.  I think one of
them was Bob, but for all I knew it could have been
Loraanthalakalodaladarin&mdash;what the heck, it was a world with magi,
right?  Why were these people named Thomas and Bob, anyway?</p>

<p>I had made a special effort to remember the names of the Archmagi,
repeating them over and over to myself as we walked.  Isaac, Reynard,
Matthew.  Isaac, Reynard, Matthew.  Isaac had the long beard, Reynard
was the funny one, Matthew was the quiet one.  Isaac, beardy.
Reynard, funny, Matthew, quiet.  Isaac, Reynard, Matthew.  I had the
names pretty well down by the time we arrived at the sitting room,
where we relaxed in overstuffed armchairs and sipped tea from fine
china in front of a toasty fire.  (Of course the six Landguard
insisted on standing, but at least they had sheathed their swords.)  I
had also figured out the obvious question.</p>

<p>"Ok, so, where's the invading army coming from?"</p>

<p>All three Archmagi looked flabbergasted.  "How could you
possibly&mdash;" Reynard began.</p>

<p>I cut him off.  "I read a lot of science fiction and fantasy.
Coramonde, Erfworld, Thomas Convenant, Wizard in Rhyme, Wizard's
Bane&mdash;the only reason modern-world people are ever sucked into a
fantasy world is because there's some Big Bad coming, and it's usually
an army."</p>

<p>They just stared at me like utterly boggled deer in very bright
headlights.  Then stared at each other in bogglement.  Then stared at
me, still boggled.</p>

<p>"Ahem," said Isaac, looking vaguely embarrassed yet again.  "Well,
actually, yes, there is an armed force invading from the south.  A
rather large one, actually.  Nearly comparable to that of Emperor
Charles the Great, the overlord of lower Tarisia.  Tarisia, of course,
is our neighbor to the east and four hundred years ago&mdash;"</p>

<p>I broke in, nodding assuredly.  "These invaders&mdash;enormous horde
of vicious barbarians, right?  Looting, pillaging, burning everything
to the ground, lamentations of their women kind of folks?"</p>

<p>"Oh no," said Isaac, happy to be able to pontificate again.  "As I
was saying, much like the army of Emperor Charles; extremely
professional and well-led soldiers with plenty of powerful magic users
in support&mdash;far more than we have, actually, especially the
higher level magi.  They seem to have made some impressive advances
in the fields of both Abjuration and Conjuration, as evidenced by
their use of wide-area shielding and various kinds of missile strikes
and conjured creatures.  I have a theory on that, actually&mdash;"</p>

<p>Thomas cleared his throat pointedly and Isaac wound down, looking
startled.</p>

<p>"In a more military sense, My Lord" said Thomas, picking up the
thread of the answer, "the enemy is moving quickly, zigzagging across
the nation to conquer all of our towns and cities.  They actually
treat their conquered people quite well as long as a city or town
submits.  They set up a local satrapy but rule lightly from what we
can discover.  Two cities, Oxport and Tor Cannle, refused to
surrender, and the Deorsi eradicated them. Literally
eradicated&mdash;they conquered the cities, killed every living thing
right down to the dogs and cats, burned the place to the ground, and
finally pulled the wreckage apart so that not a trace of any structure
remained except the foundations.  It was brilliant; after that
example, all the other cities and towns are surrendering."</p>

<p>I groaned.  "Fantastic.  Mongol tactics; utterly destroy anyone who
opposes you and treat cooperative people well.  And the Mongols ended
up ruling most of a continent.  They probably end up causing fewer
deaths this way, actually."  I sighed gloomily.  "Your population base
is going to desert in droves."</p>

<p>Once again, Thomas cleared his throat.  "<em>Your</em> population
now, My Lord."</p>

<p>I glared at him but my glare bounced off like a Gummy Bear hitting
a brick wall.  "Look, I can't do this job.  I'm a web programmer, not
a ruler.  I don't know the first thing about leading an army, or
running a country.  Shoot, I don't even balance my checkbook, and you
want me to help run the economy of your nation?  Why in the
<em>world</em> would you want me?"</p>

<p>He fixed me with a Look and replied, "The spell chose you to be the
ruler, so you are the ruler.  You serve for two full turnings of the
seasons, then you are rewarded and released.  So it is writ.  And so
it <em>will be</em>, My Lord."  Throughout this
oh-so-subtly-threatening speech, his voice remained calm, even, and
without even a trace of a hint of a possibility that he could be
moved.  Reminded me of the Terminator, actually.  Only less
cuddly.</p>

<p>Which suddenly raised a flag in my head.  <em>~Come on Jake,
you're supposed to be genre savvy~</em> I thought, angry with myself
for missing the obvious.  And I had a feeling that this might not want
to be a public conversation.</p>

<p>"Everyone, could you give us the room for a moment?  Thomas, you
stay."</p>

<p>The Archmagi frowned at being dismissed so cavalierly, but they
went.  The Landguard all looked at Thomas; he gave them a small nod
and they relucantly drifted out the door with many a disgruntled look
back.</p>

<p>"Sit down." I said firmly, pointing at the chair opposite me.  He
sat down smoothly, face impassive.</p>

<p>"Let's get specific.  What <em>exactly</em> are the terms of the
Landguard's service?"</p>

<p>He raised an eyebrow but answered readily enough.  "We serve the
Land, the Law, and the ruler in whatever capacity is required.  The
Land refers to the common citizens and the Law is the set of documents
that define the core structure of the nation.  Our primary duty is as
a bodyguard to the ruler, but we also provide oversight for the
justiciars in the outlying towns and villages and help the people
against large scale problems&mdash;floods, drought, crop failures, and
so on.  Very occasionally we are given unusual duties, such as when
Othar the Black was sent to negotiate a trade treaty with a
neighboring kingdom.  Although maybe that shouldn't count; it's a
warrior culture and he was from one of their border towns."</p>

<p>I nodded and homed in on the key item.  "You serve the Land, the
Law, and the ruler&mdash;<em>in that order</em>, right?  So if I give you
an order that goes against either the Land or the Law, you would
ignore it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, My Lord."  </p>

<p>I thought for a moment, phrasing the next question very carefully.
"Hypothetically speaking, what would your response be if I took some
action that was directly opposed to the Land or the Law?"</p>

<p>He didn't bat an eyelash.  "Hypothetically speaking, I would warn
you not to, and if you insisted I would kill you."</p>

<p>Yeah, that didn't send icy worms crawling down my spine at all.
Nope, nope, nope.  Just sitting in a chair and speaking politely this
guy was hella scary.</p>

<p>I sat back for a moment and gathered my thoughts.  Thomas waited
patiently.</p>

<p>"Ok, well good, now I'm clear on that part of it.  What are the
limits of your service?"</p>

<p>He cocked his head slightly in confusion, looking just a bit like
the RCA dog.  "I'm afraid I don't understand the question, My
Lord."</p>

<p>"Well, for example, if I gave you some stupid or frivolous order,
would you do it?  Like, if I said, 'hop on one foot for the rest of
the day', would you actually do it?"</p>

<p>"Of course.  Do you want me to?"  He seemed baffled that I would
even ask, and vaguely irritated that I might give such a demeaning
order but at least he was trying to keep things polite.</p>

<p>"No.  I'm just trying to understand your government and how I fit
into it.  All of these are just hypotheticals."</p>

<p>"Very well, My Lord."</p>

<p>This whole calm-and-accepting fanatical service thing was starting
to really creep me out.  I pushed those thoughts down and plowed
on.</p>

<p>"What if&mdash;and again, this is just hypothetical, don't do it&mdash;I
ordered you to kill yourself?  Or another Landguard, or some important
political figure in the government?  Would the part about 'the Land'
interfere?"</p>

<p>"If you gave me that order, I would kill myself, or that person.
Neither the Landguard nor the members of government are commoners, so
they are not part of the Land."</p>

<p>This was moving into outright slavery, and it was scaring the crap
out of me.  No one should be this insanely devoted to an oath.</p>

<p>I decided to raise the point.  "Thomas...this is really scary, and
not healthy.  You shouldn't be this willing to die for no reason, just
because some flake that got drafted from another dimension tells you
to." </p>

<p>He shook his head, still stone cold.  "Respectfully, My Lord, you
are wrong.  The Landguard is small, but we are the best trained
soldiers in the nation, equipped with more and better magic items than
anyone else, and we have significant, and permanent, magical
enhancements laid on us when we take up service.  We provide a major
deterrant against rebellion by the nobles; it's been eight hundred
years since there was a civil war in Flobovia."  His lips quirked very
slightly at the name.  "If there were the slightest doubt that our
oaths are not absolutely binding, the nobles and the merchants would
gather their forces to defend themselves against us.  We could easily
trigger the very civil war we were created to prevent. "</p>

<p>I digested that for a moment and had to admit it made sense.  I
forced myself to get past the weird pseudo-slavery part and recognize
the validity of the political reasons for it.  I noticed myself
feeling revolted by that and the act of noticing made me detached from
those feelings.  Then I noticed myself noticing and quickly forced my
thoughts elsewhere before the recursion made my brain explode.</p>

<p>My head is a weird place, sometimes.</p>

<p>The important thing here was that Thomas The Scarily Honorable was
much better at explaining things than Isaac The Long-Winded
Pontificator.  Thomas was also more likely to give me straight
answers.</p>

<p>"And what about the Archmagi?  What is their relationship
to...whatever my office is?"</p>

<p>Thomas gave a tiny shrug.  "There isn't one, really.  All three are
members of the Association of Magi, of course, but that's only so they
can have access to the Capital City Library's magic section.  And of
course they have the duty of performing the Summoning that brings the
ruler here every two years.  Mostly because they're the only ones who
can."</p>

<p>"So they aren't obligated to be honest with me or anything like
that?  They must have an axe to grind&mdash;what is it?"</p>

<p>He just looked at me as though I had suddenly put a rubber chicken
on my head.  "An axe to grind?"</p>

<p><em>~Note to self: whatever magic is doing the translating for me
has trouble with idioms.~</em> "An agenda, something they want."</p>

<p>He nodded, pursing his lips in thought for a moment.  "Well, the
Association is always looking for financial support; spell research
can get expensive. Besides that, for decades they've been agitating
for better access to the Capital City Library, and <em>any</em> access
to the Imperial Library.  Both are held under the control of the
throne and access to them is the main tool that the nation has to
force the Association magi to obey the laws.  If a wizard wants to
set up a tower out in the wilderness somewhere, they pretty much can.
The problem is that, when they do, they typically start doing
experiments that end up either blowing up vast tracts of land or
creating monsters that they can't be bothered to care for...so they
push them out the door and they go off to terrorize the neighborhood
until the Landguard or some adventurers show up to deal with the
issue."</p>

<p>Huh, wizards as toxic waste dumpers; that was a new one.  For now,
though, I felt like I had enough to go on.</p>

<p>"Ok, let's get the others back in here and move on."  He rose, went
to the door, and called everyone back in.  After they had settled back
into their chairs, Isaac leaned forward and was opening his mouth to
start pontificating again.</p>

<p>I jumped in quickly.  "Thomas, if I'm going to actually have to run
this show&mdash;or even pretend to&mdash;I need to understand how it
works.  In particular, how the government is structured, how magic
works, and whatever you can tell me about our military and the
invaders.  Take it in whatever order you want.  Give me the 50,000
foot view."</p>

<p>Thomas paused a moment, organizing his thoughts.  Then he started
talking, laying out everything I had asked for.  He stopped several
times to point out that he was not an expert on magic; each time, he
tried to defer the question to one of the Archmagi, but each time, I
waved him on.  </p>

<p>"Excuse me gentlemen," I told them the first time I shut Isaac
down.  "I'll ask you to explain the details of magic in a moment, but
for now it's more important to get the basics, and particularly to get
them as they're understood by a layman.  I'm interested in how much
magical knowledge there is among the general population."  The last
was vaguely true, but mostly it was a line of bullshit intended to
salve their ego. Getting it from Thomas was a lot better than
listening to Isaac ramble on.  I had met geeks who reminded me a
lot of him; if you asked them the time, they'd tell you how to mine,
smelt, and machine metal in order to build the tools to build the
gears to build a clock.</p>

<p>"We've got a lot to cover," I added.  "It'll be more efficient if
we don't switch speakers much.  Please bear with me."</p>

<p>Isaac looked sour at being denied his time in the spotlight, but
the others just shrugged and leaned back, enjoying the fire.  Thomas
went back to laying out the high level summary.</p>

<p>The government turned out to be a fairly simple feudal setup; at
the bottom were the yeomen, then petty nobles (knights, minor lords,
and so on), baronets, counts, dukes, and the ruler at the very top.
There were also religious orders and mage schools which were
technically under control of the ruler but were actually powerful
enough to mostly go their own way.  And finally, there was the
Conclave of Lords.</p>

<p>The Conclave was the only unusal thing in this otherwise
boilperlate-fantasy-novel stew&mdash;seven members, one each from the
six main powergroups plus the Commander of the Landguard.  Each of the
members was among the most powerful and respected member of their
particular class; magi, nobles, merchants, and so on.  They were
referred to as "Lord Mage", "Lord Merchant", or whatever.
Interestingly, there was even a "Lord Shadow", the representative of
the criminal class.  Apparently the crime societies were willing to
trade a degree of restraint for a degree of legitimacy (which actually
seemed like a really good idea when I thought about it).</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the organized crime cartels ended up being better
police than the actual police (which made a lot of sense actually; as
I recall both the Mafia and the Yakuza used to do the same thing in
the real world).  Case in point: certain types of crime simply didn't
happen in Flobovia.  The annual number of rapes could be counted on
the fingers of one hand, and there was no arson anywhere that fires
were likely to spread out of control&mdash;although plenty of arsons
happened in other places, and oftentimes someone normally outside the
criminal class would burn down a competitor's warehouse or such.</p>

<p>The Conclave were officially just an advisory body to the ruler
with no power of their own.  In actuality they functioned more as a
parliament or congress, with substantial lawmaking ability, and they
often clashed with the ruler or went behind his back.  It was a very
"John Marshall has made his decision, now let him enforce it!" setup,
except in reverse.  Whatever, it seemed to work for them.</p>

<p>I gathered from some disgruntled comments that Isaac and Reynard
made that most of the Conclave's law-making time was spent on laws
related to magic.  Turns out that teaching random people how to play
skee ball with the laws of the universe is not totally compatible with
a quiet and peaceful city.  Between drunken mage brawls in the
taverns, occasional escaped demons, out-of-control elementals,
rampaging golems, magic items being constructed and sold with little
to no quality assurance, spell misfires that turned three city blocks
purple, and absent-minded magi falling out of the sky when they
forgot the duration on their Fly spells...well, let's just say that
boredom was really not a problem in Flobovia's capital.</p>

<p>There were other laws, of course.  One that I was pleased to hear
about was the Slavery Nullification Edict of Sultan Phil the Second's
Year 2.  (First off, they reset their calendar every two years??
Really???  And, more important...'Sultan Phil'?  Seriously?  And he
was the <em>second one</em>?!  Either the people who
interdimensionally ganked random weirdos to run this place had a corny
sense of humor or the universe was a lot more twisted than I had
thought.)  The Edict decreed that slavery was illegal in Flobovia and
that any slave who touched Flobovian soil was thereafter free.  I was
thrilled at Flobovia's enlightened stance... until two minutes later,
when I heard about the number of people in debtor's prison or, worse,
outright debt peonage.  That took the bloom off the rose pretty darn
fast.</p>

<p>
The details kept coming as we talked; it was a lot to take in, but I
just set my brain on record and tried to soak up as much of it as
possible.</p>

<p>Once I let Isaac start talking I got a lot more detail on the
magic, although I had to keep nudging him to stay on point.  The magic
was much easier to follow than the politics since I already had a good
grasp on the ideas. It was the standard Vancian magic system used in
D&D and other games on my world; wizards memorized spells in the
morning from giant books that they carried around while clerics needed
prayer instead of a book.  Some spells had material components, some
of which were expensive or bulky.  A few types of casters, such as
sorcerers, could cast spells without memorizing them first, but most
of these types had stringent restrictions on what they could cast.
And, of course, the caster's level determined how many spells could be
cast per day.</p>

<p>I raised a hand to interrupt.  "Hang on, what did you say?  What
was that about levels?"</p>

<p>Isaac looked confused for a moment, then seemed to understand.
"Oh, of course.  You must be from a dimension with an incompatible
mystic framework&mdash;one of those point based ones, maybe?  Anyway,
yes, here people have class levels in whatever their profession is
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>I couldn't help it, I burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"You're kidding," I said wiping the tears away and still
snickering.  "Class levels?  Wizards, clerics, and sorcerors?  Let me
guess: you also have hit points, time is measured in 6-second rounds,
Magic Missile is a first level wizard spell that creates a ball of
force which never misses.  And, let me guess&mdash;Thomas
you're...what, a 15th level fighter?  No, wait, you're a paladin,
aren't you?"</p>

<p>If Thomas had been confused before, now he was amazed; oddly, the
wizards were just grinning quietly to themselves.  "18th, actually,
and yes, paladin.  If you didn't even know what class levels were, how
did you know all that?"</p>

<p>I started snickering again and waved the question away, musing out
loud.  "Hah, so this isn't just a hackneyed piece of Mary Sue fanfic,
it's a hackneyed piece of Mary Sue <em>D&D</em> fanfic.  I wonder if it's
based on some schmuck's game?"  I shrugged to myself.  "Well, at least
I remember some of the rules.  Wish I'd played more recently but meh,
Sir Poley and Milo were good teachers."</p>

<p>Thomas had clearly given up trying to understand a word I was
saying and had gone back to simply waiting quietly until my little
brain-ramble wound down.</p>

<p>"Right, ok, a few more questions.  Let's start with actions; I
remember that there are different types and restrictions on what you
can do with each in a turn, but I don't remember the details.  I've
got a couple ideas for the Deorsi, but I need to know
if... they... work."  Something weird was happening inside my head; it
felt like movie credits scrolling past behind my eyes.</p>

<p>The four of them were sitting back; the wizards' smiles looked like
cats with cream on their whiskers.  Isaac's smile looked positively
smug, Matthew's was pleased, and Reynard's was just a quiet little
thing, mostly hidden behind the cloud of smoke emanating from the pipe
he had pulled from a pocket.  Thomas's just looked a little
sympathetic.</p>

<p>"Check me on this," I said slowly.  "Time is measured in six second
rounds.  In a round, I can do one full-round action.  Or a standard
action and a move action.  Or two moves.  In any case, I can take one
or more free actions at any point.  Picking up an object is a move,
and dropping it is a free.  Right?"</p>

<p>They all nodded.</p>

<p>I turned on Reynard.  "Ok, what the hell?"  I half-spat.  "How the
hell do I know this stuff?!  It's like there's some...weird
encyclopedia in my head.  What did you do to me?"</p>

<p>Reynard just kept puffing his pipe, quiet smile firmly in place, as
Isaac jumped in.  His answer was insufferably smug.  "Well, we can
hardly afford to have a ruler who doesn't speak the language or know
how the world works, now can we?  The Summoning is quite specific; it
finds someone skilled at their trade, of sound mind and body, without
too many close ties to their homeland that would make it hard to
transport them through the Void.  It brings them here and, in the
process, it provides them a grounding in the basics of this world.
How time and movement work, the various languages, the map of the
nation and rough details about the adjoining nations and our relations
to them, a few other things.  In addition, it takes whatever
non-magical written information is inside the Summoning Circle, burns
it to ash, and embeds the information therein in your mind.  In your
case, we had it implant a compendium of all the creatures of a mystic
origin and many of the mundane ones we knew of, plus the effects of
all the spells the three of us knew or could find descriptions for.
You won't be able to cast them, of course, but you'll know how they
work."</p>

<p>I was stuck somewhere between sensibile admiration, rage, and
shock.</p>

<p><em>~They messed with our <strong>mind</strong>!~</em> said Rage.</p>

<p><em>~But it was a smart thing to do.  And pretty useful.~</em> said
Sensibility.</p>

<p><em>~Wurble, wruble, flibble...gahhhhhhhh!~</em> said Shock.</p>

<p><em>~See?!  Shock is on my side!  They messed with our MIND!~</em>
said Rage.</p>

<p><em>~He's not on your side, he's just babbling.~</em> said
Sensibility.</p>

<p>It was about at this point that I had to laugh at myself for
actually imagining this internal dialogue (trialogue?).  The laughter
blew the anger and shock away, and my sensible side was back in
control.  Rage whispered a final snide comment at me before
dispersing: <em>~you know they'll do it again if they feel it's
necessary.</em>~ I shook the thought away but it still took root in a
dark little corner of my heart.</p>

<p>Looking at Reynard again, I shrugged.  Having the summoning ritual
give the ruler a general knowledge base, in fact, was a very sensible
thing.  And in my case, an incredibly useful one.  I would need to
know this stuff cold if I was going to Munchkin my way out of this
mess.</p>

<p>I visualized my new Brainopedia as a giant leather-bound
tome&mdash;I always liked that word.  "Tome." So much classier than
the banal "book."  In my mental picture it was thicker than the New
York yellow pages, more than a cubit tall&mdash;another cool word,
'cubit'&mdash;and about half that wide.  I riffled through it until I
found the pages I needed, reviewing the map of the countryside, and
the descriptions of certain spells and constructs.</p>

<p>"Ok, let's get back to it.  How badly are we outnumbered?"</p>

<p>Thomas's answer sounded grim.  "If we strip the nation bare we can
raise about twenty thousand troops from the various nobles, including
a few thousand mercenaries.  On top of that we have two thousand
Landguard and a few hundred members of the special units.  The problem
is that military authority in Flobovia is...diffuse.  Each soldier is
loyal to his specific lord, each of the lords being loyal to his lord
and so on, until you get to the Dukes.  The Dukes, in theory, obey the
throne, but in practice they fight to maintain their own independent
authority.  And since the troops are loyal to their own immediate
lords, the direct military authority of Capital City is more a polite
fiction than a reality."</p>

<p>I frowned in puzzlement.  "How does that work?  How do you protect
a country with a military that's so fractured?"</p>

<p>Thomas shrugged with a look of chagrin.  "It's our fault, actually.
Since our inception, the Landguard has worked to prevent any form of
centralized military authority from arising.  It made things safer;
Flobovia hasn't needed a national military in over a millenium, and
the biggest threat was a civil war caused by an attempted coup
d'&eacute;tat.  The local militias take care of any wild animals or
brigands, the special units handle any powerful monsters that show up,
and the Landguard...well, we make sure that no internal threats come
up."</p>

<p>The smile didn't last though; he looked somber again as he
continued.  "It's biting us now, though.  As far as we can tell, the
Deorsi outnumber us five to one in troops and, on average, their
troops are better&mdash;we'd guess they're each about fourth level
fighters, maybe higher, while ours are mostly first or second.  They
also have a unified command structure and supply train.  It's also
clear that they have more wizards of each level, and more magi
overall, than we do.  They also have excellent cleric support so
healing isn't a problem for them."</p>

<p>Argh.  This was going to suck.  "Ok...tell me about these 'special
units' you mentioned?"  I was hoping that they were all crossbreed
ninja clones made from the genomes of Chuck Norris and Arnold
Schwarzenegger; badass shadow warrior assassins able to cause
earthquakes by punching the ground and dual-wielding infinite-ammo
paired miniguns.</p>

<p>Thomas shrugged.  "The special units are comprised entirely of
people with class levels&mdash;many of them quite high&mdash;who want
to be attached to the army but not <em>in</em> the army.  They serve
in their own small squads, usually four to six people to a squad but
sometimes as few as two or as many as seven.  They generally have a
mix of class types, although sometimes they will all be of the same or
related classes.  They provide most of their own gear, although they
are able to requisition supplies, equipment, healing, and so on from
any army base.  In general, they are equipped with a broad assortment
of combat-oriented magical gear which makes them extremely useful in
certain capacities&mdash;scouts, snipers, siege breakers, various
other things.  They are highly paid and take strategic direction from
High Command, but make their own tactical choices."</p>

<p>I nodded.  "So, basically, adventuring parties who decided that
army service is nicer than dungeon crawls but aren't willing to put up
with marching in rows.  Ok, got it.  What about the Landguard?"</p>

<p>Thomas glanced at the Archmagi appraisingly.  "Our number is
restricted by Writ to two thousand, M'Lord, all paladins.  Beyond
that, I would prefer to answer in private, if I may."</p>

<p>I was surprised by the answer but decided not to push it; he surely
had a good reason.  Instead, I turned to other things.</p>

<p>The briefing kept going, covering a wide variety of topics.  Many
of them were in my Brainopedia, at least in outline, but it was useful
to get details and confirmation from Thomas or one of the Archmagi.
On one or two subjects, the Brainopedia turned out to be incorrect or
misleading, which was profoundly disturbing.</p>

<p>
Two hours in, we stopped briefly to order some food.  Within five
minutes, a girl in a maid's uniform was bringing in a tray with a big
piping hot meat pie, an array of fresh baked breads, multiple kinds of
cheeses and fruit, and a pitcher of hot cider.  She was very pretty
but I chose to ignore it; I was old enough to be her father.  She also
carried a canvas bag containing charcoal briquettes, which she added
neatly to the fire, using tongs so as not to get herself filthy.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Suze.  Tasty stuff!  Apple trees, right?" said the
flames.</p>

<p>I practically jumped out of my chair.  "Yow!" I yelled.  "It
talks!"</p>

<p>The young maid looked at me in alarm, clearly frightened.  "Yes,
M'Lord," she said, bobbing a nearly frantic curtsy.  "This is Allison,
M'Lord.  She's a salamander, M'Lord, and responsible for providing the
fire in whatever room of the castle you're in, M'Lord."</p>

<p>"She's also <em>right here</em>", said the fire grumpily.  "I can
talk for myself, Suze.  Anyway, yes, Your High and Mightiness, I'm
bound to, and I quote, 'provide cheery, pleasant, and well contained
light and heating for the ruler regardless of his spatial location.'
So, yeah, I follow you around like a puppy dog and sit in the boring
old fireplace or on a torch or a candle except when you specifically
tell me to sod off and leave the room dark so you can sleep."
</p>

<p>
This was followed by, I swear to God, a disgruntled sniff.  How she
did it with no nose, I have no idea.
</p>

<p>"I came to this plane to see things, talk to things, and taste
things.  I wanted to munch on some of the yummy peach trees and
delicious anthracite seams and the miles of delicious dried grasses
that I had heard so much about.  Instead, I've been squatting in this
freezing pile of rock for five hundred years, following the latest
doofus from room to room.  High point of my day is when one of the
girls brings me something tasty to nosh.  By the way, thanks again
Suze; this really is yummy."</p>

<p>I was grinning from ear to ear.  <em>Finally</em>, someone who
didn't think I was the Second Coming.  Seeing my grin, Suze unbent
enough to respond to the little elemental, although she was still shy
about it.  "You're welcome, Allison.  I know how much you like the
apple charcoal, so I asked them to set some aside for you."</p>

<p>I bowed to the fireplace.  "It's a pleasure to meet you, Allison.
Please excuse my jumpiness, I've never met an elemental before.
Anyway, give me some time, and I'll see if we can't improve things for
you.  In the meantime&mdash;Suze, please make sure Allison gets nothing
but the apple charcoal, or whatever other fuel she likes that we have
available.  And thanks for introducing us."</p>

<p>Suze looked at me wide-eyed, as though I'd just grown a second head
out of my elbow.  But she quickly gathered herself up, bobbed another
curtsey and, with a hurried "Yes, M'Lord" she was gone.</p>

<p>
We went back to the briefing, continuing for several hours until I
started feeling like my brain was going to explode.  At that point, I
rose to wish them all goodnight, saying that I would sit here a bit
longer.</p>

<p>"Your guards, of course, will need to remain, M'Lord," Thomas
declared firmly, even as he started to rise.</p>

<p>I pulled a face.  "Can't they just wait outside?  I'd like some
time to myself."</p>

<p>Thomas's answer was granite-firm.  "No, M'Lord.  You cannot be left
alone; so it is Writ."</p>

<p>I sighed.  "Fine, you stay, the other guards leave.  Gentlemen," I
said, turning to the Archmagi and offering a handshake.  "Thank you
for your help tonight; the details really helped."  In a moment, I was
alone again with Thomas while Allison crackled in the fireplace.</p>

<p>Settling back into my chair, I let my thoughts drift for a long
while until I was right on the edge of falling asleep.  Eventually, a
thought nagged at me.</p>

<p>"I'm guessing most of your rulers aren't terribly polite to the
servants?" I asked Thomas idly, thinking back to Suze and her
jumpiness.
</p>

<p>
He raised an eyebrow at the odd topic, but answered.  "Not really,
M'Lord.  Most of them treat the servants as conveniences.  The
previous ruler was a good example; harmless enough but unthinking and
somewhat insulting to those around him.  Spent most of his time in his
workroom building little gadgets.  He was fond of calling one of the
serving girls up to his rooms at night, though.  The one before him
was more competent, but also enjoyed his, ah, 'prerogatives'."</p>

<p>"That ends now," I told him firmly, my lethargy forgotten.
"Anyone, of any rank, who compels a woman to have sex against her will
will be punished severely.  Got it?"</p>

<p>Thomas grinned in satisfaction.  "I'll make sure to pass the word,
M'Lord."</p>

<p>"That's another thing&mdash;this My Lord crap has to go, at least
between you and me.  You're going to be with me all the time, and
you're going to be one of my principle advisors.  Call me Jake."</p>

<p>Thomas nodded, saying nothing.</p>

<p>"Good to meet you too, Jake," Allison said.  "So, you guys gonna be
talking late, Jake?  Because, you know, if you're not, you can always
order me outta here, Jake.  I know when I'm not needed, Jake." said
Allison, making it obvious that she was deliberately yanking my chain
with the familiarity; especially since I hadn't explicitly offered it
to her.</p>

<p>I snorted and grinned again.  "No, please stick around for now,
Allison; we've got a lot to discuss, and you make the room a lot
nicer.  Feel free to chime in if you've got anything relevant.
Just...please don't distract us, I'm beat."</p>

<p>"Huh.  You know, in five hundred years there've only been a few
rulers who's ever said much more to me than 'Brighter' or 'Hotter';
most of them can't get past the 'elemental' thing."  She sounded
exactly the same as a person would while watching a dolphin ride a
bicycle to the market for fresh coleslaw.</p>

<p>I gave her a tired smile.  "It's nice to have someone to talk to
who isn't too impressed with me."  Something raised a flag, and I
asked her "Lacking any segue at all, what are the exact terms of your
binding?"</p>

<p>"'Terms having been agreed, this elemental shall be bound by its
True Name'&mdash;I'm not saying my Name so don't ask&mdash;"'unto those
terms, which are as follows: the elemental shall provide cheery,
pleasant, well-controlled and well-contained light and heating for the
ruler regardless of the ruler's spatial location.  Said light and heat
shall be provided to whatever degree and from whatever location the
ruler requires.  The elemental shall not depart the ruler's presence
unless explicitly ordered to depart by the ruler in his or her own
person and of the ruler's own free will.  When not needed, this
elemental shall return directly to the circle of its summoning and
wait for the ruler to call it back, at which time it shall return to
the ruler instantly and resume its duties.  The elemental shall hold
in confidence all aspects of the ruler's life, including but not
limited to conversations, thoughts, appearance, location, close
companions and advisers, actions of any sort, and all other details
pertaining unto the ruler.  At no time shall the elemental harm any
living being.'"</p>

<p>I sat back, thinking it through.</p>

<p>Allison hemmed a bit.  "That's a rough translation, of course.  The
actual language of magic is far more precise than this sloppy stuff
that you meatsacks use."</p>

<p>Both Thomas's and my lips quirked a bit at that.  "Sloppy, huh?
That oath sounded like something a whole team of pricey lawyers would
draw up," I told her.  "So, since 'Allison' clearly isn't your True
Name, where did it come from?"</p>

<p>Her reply sounded wistful.  "There was a cleaning woman named
Allison here in the castle, about fifty years after I got here.  Cute
little thing, about Suze's age.  One of her jobs was to keep me fed,
so we saw each other every day.  Neither of us had many people to talk
to, so we would always take some time to chat."</p>

<p>I nodded, understanding how nice it was to make a friend when you
were lonely in a strange place; I'd been there when I first moved
cross-country.  "I'm sorry you were lonely.  What happened to the
original Allison?"</p>

<p>"She got old, then she died."</p>

<p>"Oh."  I'd put my foot straight into that one;
Allison-the-elemental had been here for five hundred years, of course
she'd outlived everyone she'd known along the way.  "I'm sorry, I
should have realized." </p>

<p>"Meh, it happens," she said, clearly making an effort to shake off
the mood.  "You meatbags go out like fireflies&mdash;which, by the way,
is a really stupid name, since there's no fire in them at all."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I know, just chemical reaction," I responded distractedly.
I sighed tiredly.  "Thomas, do I really need to lead this war effort
personally?  There must be experienced people in charge of the army
and whatever.  Can't they lead while I just stay out of the way?"
Even to me, my voice sounded whiny.</p>

<p>Thomas shook his head firmly.  "No, M'Lo&mdash;no, Jake.  Incidentally,
you really should decide on what title you want to use; My Lord is the
term of respect used for someone of unknown rank, so it would be good
to identify yourself.</p>

<p>"To answer your question, however: yes, we have competent generals;
I would even say that one or two of them are brilliant.  But it
doesn't matter; none of the generals can think of a way to win; we
simply don't have the forces or the strength to defeat the Deorsi.</p>

<p>I sighed and thought for a minute.  "Okay, they're almost certainly
going to cross the Maligaw River.  Most of it is too deep and too fast
for that to be safe, and there's only two bridges.  Right?"</p>

<p>
Thomas nodded.  "Yes, exactly.  And if we cut the bridges, it would be
relatively easy to prevent them from building new bridges by hand.
They could do it with magic, but even after they make it across the
river, the border with Elfhame bulges inward; they'll either need to
pass through the Hame or lose almost a week marching west before they
can turn north and come towards us again.  Our generals thought of
that; they don't feel that they could hold the river.  Instead, the
Deorsi would pin them down with part of their force and circle around
with the rest.  We could lose the entire army that way."</p>

<p>"But isn't it better than nothing?  We could hold them for a while,
bleed them a bit, then retreat and do it again somewhere else.  We
can't afford a stand up fight or to let them reach the capital, so we
need to keep them moving sideways across the country.  And we need to
make sure that every battle we fight is from a solid position.
Strategic offensive, tactical defensive."  I was quoting directly from
some of my favorite alternate-history fantasy but hey, it wasn't like
there was anyone here who could sue me for copyright violation.

<p>Thomas shrugged, clearly not agreeing but unwilling to argue any
further.  "Well, no matter what route they take they'll go past
several cities and a lot of towns.  If they stop to deal with the
cities, which seems to be their pattern, that'll give us another week
or ten days.  They'll also need to drop off small detachments at each
city and town to run the place, so their numbers will be a bit reduced
by the time they arrive."</p>

<p>I nodded, consulting my Brainopedia again.  "Right...they can't go
through the Fens because they'd lose half their army to quicksand and
the local fauna," I paused as the Brainopedia coughed up an
interesting tidbit.  "Especially the fenfrogs."  The 'frogs weren't
actually frogs, but they looked like frogs.  They literally ate magic;
anything touched by their four-foot tongues was sucked dry of all
mystic energy.  Magic items were permanently drained and spellcasters
lost the ability to use magic for a week or so.  "And they can't
circle the Fens to the west, because the headwaters of the Fens are
well inside the Senis Hills, and after that the mountains."</p>

<p>Thomas nodded.  "Indeed.  No one goes through the Hills; since
Archmage Senis accidentally blew up his tower last millenium there's
more magic there than anywhere else we know of, and it makes the place
warped.  You go in, you don't come out.  The Deorsi will know all
that, either from captured maps or from scrying."</p>

<p>"Scrying, right.  Going to have to do something about that; single
biggest thing we need to deny them is intelligence," I told myself,
thinking out loud.  I tumbled some ideas around for a minute, but felt
them scattering as they always did.</p>

<p>"I'm not good at working things out in my head; can't keep it all
straight, I need something to write on.  Better yet, a computer, but
I'm pretty sure you don't have Apple stores here."</p>

<p>Thomas kept his mouth shut; by now he had caught on to my weird
references enough to realize that I wasn't talking about produce
vendors.</p>

<p>I riffled through the Brainopedia looking for something that would
work in lieu of electronics.  Surprisingly, I found it.  And by now I
was far too caught up in the problem to remember that I had been
planning to go to bed.</p>

<p>"Let's see...we're going to need some staff for this.  Could you
ask someone to send in half a dozen couriers, two or three scribes,
and Archmage Reynard?  Also, I need to know how many casters or magic
items we have available that can produce Wall of Iron, Teleport, and
any of the various flight-related spells.  Also, the Dedicated Wright
construct.  Oh, and ask Suze to send in enough food for everyone."</p>

<p>I was expecting him to get up and go to the door but instead he
just tapped a stud on his steel bracer and said "Sending to Archmage
Reynard: Please return. Bring six couriers, three scribes, count on
available Wall of Iron, Dedicated Wright, Teleport, all Fly spells.
Suze to bring food for all."  Immediately, a sparrow made out of gray
smoke popped out of the bracer and flew off through the wall.  A few
seconds later the sparrow flew back in and hovered in front of Thomas,
speaking in Reynad's voice: "Message received, all sendings
dispatched, on my way.  ETA 5 minutes.  Re message: Nice
counting."</p>

<p>Well of course.  What else would a magical society use for
telephones other than tape-recorder ghost birds?  How silly of me to
be surprised.</p>

<p>I paused to narf some food from the tray that Suze had brought in
earlier.  The cider was lukewarm by now but still delicious.  The
cheeses were amazing&mdash;a blue so sharp it gave my tongue a
papercut, a creamy and nutty goat cheese, and so on.  There was only
one I didn't like, a crumbly semisoft cheese with a barnyardy flavor
that I wanted nothing to do with.  The pie was as delicious as most of
the cheeses&mdash;a buttery, flaky shell wrapped around gently spiced
lamb so tender it shredded when you looked at it, a rich sauce made
with plenty of wine, lots and lots of different vegetables, and a
thick garlic mashed potato crust on top.  Heaven.  At my invitation
Thomas dug in to the food as well; he seemed to agree with my
assessment, as he wolfed a big slice of the pie and several bits of
cheese and fruit, but avoided the barnyardy one.</p>

<p>Before Thomas and I had finished with our gustatory bliss, Reynard
walked in, followed only moments later by a series of fit young men
who were clearly couriers and three slightly tubby middle-aged men who
were clearly scribes.  All of the couriers and scribes arrived at a
dead run, which I found disconcerting; I still couldn't get used to
the attitude these people had towards me.  It was nuts&mdash;I was just a
middle-aged programmer, not a divine being.</p>

<p>Reynard settled in one of the two remaining armchairs near the
fireplace with Thomas and me, while the minions (I couldn't help
thinking of them that way, given their attitude) took a bench against
the wall and waited quietly, the scribes with pens poised.</p>

<p>By the time everyone was in place, Suze and three other maids were
bringing in multiple big trays of food and several small tables to put
it all on.  They gave us a new pitcher of hot cider, refilled our
platter, made sure the minions were well provided for, and swept out
quickly.</p>

<p>I turned to Reynard, shifting tracks.  "Ok, Reynard, first thing I
need is a computer to keep track of everything.  And, given where we
are, it might as well be a cool Tony Stark / Iron Man
holographic-style interface that lets me gesture dramatically to do
ridiculously simple things.  <em>Major Image</em> should do nicely, if
you wouldn't mind."</p>

<p>He smiled again, graciously accepting his clear victory in the
oh-so-very-subtle 'Yeah, I downloaded stuff to your brain, got a
problem with that?' battle.  "Absolutely, M'Lord."  A twiddle of the
fingers, a soft mumble, and a bit of burned fleece later, we were in
business.</p>

<p>It's a little weird having one of the three most powerful
physics-breakers in the country as your own personal JARVIS, but damn
if it wasn't cool.  And I figured it was the least Reynard owed me for
messing with my mind.</p>
