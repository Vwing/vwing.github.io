<p>
<strong><center>THIS IS AN OMAKE</center></strong>
</p>

<p>
<em>(For non-Japanese speakers: an omake is a 'what if?' story, it's
not part of canon.  In other words, this didn't really happen in
2YE.)</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Parts of the following may end up being lifted into canon, but for
now it's just a bonus. I had so much fun with the idea I had to share
it, but I can't actually put it in canon or I have to give it to the
villains too, at which point the story is just over and the heroes die
instantly.

<p>
"Ok," I said, carefully choosing my next question for Loki.  "You and
I have two deals," I began, speaking slowly and carefully.  "These
deals allow us to ask questions and receive answers from you, with
certain provisos.  Aside from using these questions, what should we do
in order to maximize our information gathering abilities, where the
referenced actions can be accomplished within twenty four hours using
resources that are actually available to us?"
</p>

<p>
"Huhhhnnn," the zebra neighed, before morphing into a parrot in a
birdcage.  "Rawk!  Interesting question!  Rawk!"
</p>

<p>
The birdcage morphed again, becoming a gold- and gem-encrusted throne
piled high with pillows.  A moment later, the bird stretched and
deformed itself into Loki, clad in a purple silk suit and spats.  He
pondered briefly, eyeing his nails as he did.
</p>

<p>
"Hmmm," he said, puffing on his cigarette holder.  "I think I'm not
going to answer that.  Too many of the other gods would be pissed
off if I did."
</p>

<p>
Well now, <em>that</em> was interesting.  Clearly, there was a method
that we could actually use to gather large amounts of intelligence
relatively cheaply.  Cheaply enough that the gods would be pissed
about mortals knowing it.  Hm.  That could actually be a problem; if
we figured it out, Ilara or one of her buddies might show up again to
twist my head off.  Still, it <em>would</em> be incredibly useful....
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to use an 'truthful but maybe deceptive and you can't refuse
to answer' question, please," I asked.  "Let's assume that there is an
action X that you were thinking of when you decided not to answer my
question about how we could maximize our information gathering
abilities.  Let's assume that there is a set Y of gods who would
prevent us from using X and/or would interfere with our use of it.
What actions can we take to reduce set Y to the null set?"
</p>

<p>
Loki pondered that for a minute, his lips moving silently as he
repeated the question to himself silently several times.  Eventually,
a slow smile spread over his face.  "Another interesting question.
The vast majority of gods get upset when mortals start acquiring too
much information; it makes it too easy for them to ascend.  On the
other hand, we like it when <em>our</em> worshippers find ways to
acquire lots of information, because it tends to increase our power in
the world and, if they do ascend, they end up being minor deities who
owe us a lot of favors&mdash;great material for lieutenants, in other
words.  And, in the very rare case that we see someone doing that
who <em>isn't</em> already dedicated to one of us, then everyone gets
excited about recruiting him.
</p>

<p>
"Given all that, there's a push-pull about the whole thing.  There's
no specific treaty about it but we don't generally bother anyone who
has found a major information source unless they start abusing
it...pulling information out of it too quickly, or pulling out
information that is clearly too valuable to allow a mortal to have.
</p>

<p>
"Anyway, if there <em>were</em> such a thing as your Action X, then
you'd just need to not be a jerk about it."  Suddenly I was facing an
Ancient Master, straight out of Kung Fu Theatre: a little old Asian
man in a white gi with an age-tattered, faded-to-gray belt around his
waist.  His hands were tucked into his sleeves, a long Fu Manchu
mustache drooped down past his chin, and he had an insufferable air of
'I know more than you.'
</p>

<p>
"In short, grasshopper," the little old stereotype told me.  "All you
must do is seek the path of wisdom.  Do not listen to the 'I', listen
only to the Unity.  Be at one with the world, do not do battle with
it.  One who is in battle cannot stay balanced; his feet shall always
be driven from the path.  Seek the path and remain on it, lest you
upset the gods; upset not the gods, for you are crunchy and good with
ketchup."
</p>

<p>
On that somewhat anachronistically jarring image, Loki reverted to his
Harlequin form and lounged sideways on his throne, swinging his legs
and sipping a Mai Tai.
</p>

<p>
I leaned my chair back on its rear legs and got all abstracted as I
pondered what Loki had said.  With all the wacky hijinks and
fortune-cookie mumbo jumbo stripped aside, what was the basic message?
Apparently, if I could figure out what this divination method was, I
could <em>use</em> it as long as I didn't <em>abuse</em> it?  Ok, that
seemed reasonable.
</p>

<p>
Loki was staring at me very intently over his drink, and suddenly I
had the sense I was missing something. I paused and went back over the
words again; Loki had been feeding me information on the sly for a
while now...was there more there?  I wasn't sure why he didn't just
come out and say it, but maybe that just wasn't his style.
</p>

<p>
Or...huh.  There were two reasons to be all coy like this; you wanted
to mess with the person you were passing the information to, or you
didn't want someone else to know that you were passing the
information.
</p>

<p>
The probability that Loki was messing with me was roughly 1.0...but
the probability that he was hiding his information-passing from
someone else was not 0.  Clearly, the gods enforced rules amongst
themselves.  Also, Drifa had mentioned something about 'Overgods'
which, best guess, were gods who set rules for the gods.  Perhaps Loki
was hiding from them?
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the Brainopedia flopped open in front of me and I knew what
he was telling me.  My chair slapped forward and I stood up so fast
that I bumped the table hard enough to spill people's drinks.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, Loki, got it.  Don't be a jerk, don't abuse it.  Got it, I'll
keep that in mind," I told him hurriedly.  "I need to go...uh...use
the bathroom.  And eat something, and do...a thing.  Anyway, thanks so
much for coming.  Can we use the rest of the questions later?"
</p>

<p>
He bowed from the waist without getting up, then instantly
vanished. For just a moment, I thought I heard very quiet snickering.
</p>

<p>
I leaned forward, looking around the table with fever-bright eyes.
"Come on guys, we really should get out of here in case Afi is
watching.  We <em>totally</em> need to go seek us some wisdom.  Unn,
Drifa, I need you to find me a mage and a cleric with some particular
spells prepared...."
</p>

<p>
I led the charge out of the room so fast the Landguard had to work to
catch up.  My thoughts were racing ahead to how I could avoid getting
a divine smackdown for what I was pretty sure was going to be my
fourth...fifth?...was going to be <em>yet another</em> worldbreak.
Idly, I wondered what it said about me and Stupidworld that I had
actually had to create the word 'worldbreak.'
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
I finished writing the last of the many, many pieces of paper, set it
on the floor of the tiny cubicle, and closed the door.
</p>

<p>
Everyone was looking at me in bemusement; I had refused to explain
anything until this point.  I was giggling about it too much, and I
wanted to see the expressions on their faces when I showed them.  The
first step had been finding someone to cast a Mage's Magnificent
Mansion with a specific floorplan.  Specifically, it was a single
enormous room, the walls of which were entirely covered with high
school lockers.  The second step had been to get several reams of
paper, write one sentence on each, and place each one in a separate
locker.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, here we go," I said, bouncing on my toes in excitement.  "Priest
Ake, here's what I need you to do."  I handed him a paper with written
directions.
</p>

<p>
The blond priest read the directions, looked at me in confusion, then
shrugged and did as he was told.  "Find the Path to: The locker in
this room that contains a paper with a true statement on it!"  he
declared.  Instantly, he walked to the twenty-seventh locker on the
left, opened it, and brought me the paper.
</p>

<p>
"Huh," I said, reading it.  "Ok, looks like Afi is at grid square
JJ-47 on map 691, less than one mile underground.  Unn, I need you to
go cast a Polymorph Any Object for me...."
</p>

<hr />

<p>
<em>Explanation for the non-D&D players: Find the Path is a cleric
spell that gives you instant knowledge of how to get from where you
are to anywhere you want to be.  It even gives information about "when
you get to the red door, the password is 'Swordfish'" and "don't step
on the fourth tile or it will explode and shower kittens everywhere."
The exploit shown above would never be allowed by any sane DM, but
Stupidworld is clearly not run by a sane DM.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>For the record, 'Find the Path' does not exist in 2YE. </em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Also, should you feel the urge to nerdrage about how this wouldn't
work because blah blah blah...yes, you're very smart.  Hush.</em>
