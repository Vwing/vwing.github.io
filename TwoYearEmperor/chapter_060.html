<body><a href=chapter_059.html>Previous</a><hr />

  
<p>
<em><strong>Author's Note</strong>: D&D is many things to many people.
To me, it is "that fun game franchise that virtually prints money none
of which is mine because I don't own the game."</em>
</p>

<hr />

<p>
"Um...hi?" I said to the thing that had eaten my friend's brain.  It
wasn't my most brilliant conversational gambit ever, but it was the
best I could come up with on short notice.
</p>

<p>
<strong>"Greetings,"</strong> the thing replied.  And then it just
stood there, not moving, speaking, or even blinking.  Clearly, it
expected me to do all the work in this conversation.
</p>

<p>
I fumbled around in the shambles of my poor discombobulated brain for
the next thing to say.  Fortunately, Albrecht stepped up.
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me, but what should we call you?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
<strong>"I</strong> Reynard, <strong>am</strong> of <strong>a</strong>
course. <strong>fragment</strong> I'm <strong>of</strong>
still <strong>the</strong> me <strong>Magelord</strong>
I <strong>Arros.</strong> am <strong>I</strong>
simply <strong>have</strong> sharing <strong>no</strong>
my <strong>identity</strong> body <strong>of</strong>
with <strong>my</strong> the <strong>own.</strong>
fragment, <strong>You</strong> but <strong>may</strong>
I'm <strong>call</strong> still <strong>me</strong>
the <strong>as</strong> same <strong>you</strong>
person. <strong>please,"</strong> the thing stated in that flat,
inhuman chorus.
</p>

<p>
Okaaaay.
</p>

<p>
"Could you repeat that, please?  I didn't quite follow," I asked
plaintively.  The thing was as hard to understand as the New York City
subway public address system.  This is an impressive feat, since the
NYC PA sounds like the announcer is some non-native-speaker drunk with
no teeth.  Understanding <em>this</em> speaker, however, was literally
life-critical if I didn't want some god kicking my head in because I
didn't understand that it had told me not to play in metaphorical
traffic.
</p>

<p>
"I said <strong>Be silent, mortal.</strong>"
</p>

<p>
We all looked at each other, trying to understand which one of us the
thing was addressing.
</p>

<p>
<strong>"I am a fragment of the Magelord Arros.  I share this body
with Archmage Reynard Aguillard. I am allowing him to be aware of our
conversation and, in a moment, I will permit him to speak.  As to how
to call me, I have no identity of my own.  You may call me as you
please."</strong>
</p>

<p>
There is a voice in the back of my head that I call StupidJake.  He's
the one responsible for such brilliant ideas as "Jump off the
building! You'll fly!" or "Drink the J&auml;germeister! It'll make you
sexier!"  Right about now he was bouncing frantically up and down
suggesting that a great name for the
divine-messenger-god-fragment-scary-thing would be "Asyouplease."  I
booted StupidJake firmly in the head and sent him to bed with no
supper.
</p>

<p>
"Would you object if we called you Fragment?" Thomas asked.  Trust a
soldier to find the simple and pragmatic solution.
</p>

<p>
The thing shrugged Reynard's shoulders like an inexperienced
puppeteer.  <strong>"It is as good a name as any. Now, the host wishes
to speak."</strong>  Those inhuman multi-colored eyes blinked
closed, then reopened to reveal Reynard's wonderfully human brown
ones.
</p>

<p>
"I'm fine," he said quickly.  "Don't worry, I'm actually glad of this.
In exchange for the use of my body, the Fragment has been talking to
me, telling me about the nature of magic and the universe."  His gaze
drifted off to the place where memories and ideas reside.  "Obviously
we've just started, and I don't understand very much of it yet, but
what I do understand is beautiful.  It's all so simple, how the parts
fit together, how elegant the underlying realities are.  I wouldn't
trade this for anything."
</p>

<p>
We digested that for a moment.  
</p>

<p>
"No offense, Reynard," I said cautiously.  "How do we know that we're
actually talking to you right now, and not to Fragment?  If it has
access to your memories it could scam us easily."
</p>

<p>
The eyes blinked closed and open again in glowing, swirly sign that
Fragment had resumed control. <strong>"The Magelord implanted me
during the conference, after guaranteeing the safety of everyone
present.  For me to harm the Archmage would be against my nature.  He
resides within me quite safely."</strong>
</p>

<p>
"But you control his body and he is only able to communicate when you
permit it," Isaac demanded with more than a hint of anger.  Albrecht
discreetly placed a calming hand on his arm and gave him a small
headshake.  <em>Do not taunt Happy Fun Semi-Divine Being, for you are
crunchy and good with ketchup,</em> it seemed to say.  Isaac snarled
slightly but shut up.
</p>

<p>
<strong>"That is correct.  It is not necessary for the host to
communicate.  He is being given fair payment for the use of his body.
If the Magelord decides to recall me, the host will have suffered no
ill effects."</strong>
</p>

<p>
I noticed that 'if' with great concern.  'When' would have been such a
more reassuring choice.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you for explaining," Albrecht said with a smile that had no
doubt been carefully practiced at thousands of state dinners.  "It's
a great honor to meet you, and we're very grateful to the Magelord
for sending you to us.  I do have a request, however: could you please
allow Reynard control of his body?  We need his assistance in the war
we're currently fighting.  Not having his thoughts and skills would
decrease our chances of survival, which I feel would go against the
Magelord's guarantee of safety for the people at the conference."
</p>

<p>
<strong>"You are no longer at the conference,"</strong> Fragment
announced with a tone of finality.  <strong>"The guarantee no longer
applies, and your safety is once again your own affair."</strong>  It
paused.  <strong>"Also, the Archmage can remain isolated from the body
indefinitely with no ill effects.  I cannot.  My purpose is to judge
your actions and guide them.  Were I to yield control and be reduced
to merely watching, it would mean my death; I would see the occasions
when you required guidance, but would be unable to fulfill my
purpose."</strong>
</p>

<p>
"Can you sleep?" Unn asked.  "If so, you wouldn't have to see it all.
And you can be confident that you'll be able to fulfill your function;
we have strong incentive to check with you before doing anything that
might displease your creator, so we'll wake you up any time something
comes up that could be relevant.  If you're worried that we might try
to conceal something from you, just wake up periodically and judge us
based on circumstances or our thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"Also," she continued.  "Having Reynard as part of our group would
increase our chances for survival, as Albrecht stated.  The Magelord
is certainly no longer required to care about our safety, but he
should have at least a minimal interest; it would reflect poorly on
him if we came to harm directly because of actions that he took while
guaranteeing our safety.  Finally, remember we are the primary
adversaries to the Death God's worshippers on the Material Plane; if
the Magelord opposes the Death God, then he has at least some interest
in our well-being."
</p>

<p>
Fragment stood there, considering her words while we all held our
breath in anticipation of its answer.
</p>

<p>
<strong>"Very well,"</strong> it said at last.  "<strong>I will sleep,
and yield control of this body to the host.  Be aware that I shall
awaken periodically; if the host does not relinquish control again, I
shall declare this a breach of faith and act accordingly.
Furthermore, do not attempt to conceal anything from me when I awaken.
The mere attempt will be considered a violation of the
Edict." </strong></p>
</p>

<p>
"We won't," Unn assured him; the rest of us nodded fervent agreement.
Even the Anundj&aring;ns who didn't know or particularly care about
Reynard were onboard, since they didn't want to have to deal with
Fragment continuously.
</p>

<p>
Once again, Fragment's eyes closed and Reynard's opened.  He was
promptly subjected to several minutes of relieved backslapping, "nice
to see you"s, and "so, what's it like to be possessed by a god's
fingernail?"  I started the process but stepped back after a moment to
give the others their turn.
</p>

<p>
"Suze, got a pen?" I asked, speaking quietly so as not to disrupt the
impromptu celebration.  She nodded happily and produced both pen and
paper from her Belt of Many Pockets.
</p>

<p>
I thanked her and stepped to the table to write.  I did several
drafts, examining the wording carefully to get it just so.  Once I was
satisfied, I wrote out several slight variations, folded them up, and
turned back to the others.
</p>

<p>
My timing was good; the expressions of relief at Reynard's freedom
were just winding down.
</p>

<p>
"Ok folks, back to work," I told them with a smile. I waited until
they were looking at me again, then focused on Isaac.  "Isaac, I know
I said this earlier, but it bears repeating:  I am tremendously sorry
about tricking you.  At the time, I told you that what I was asking
you to do could end the war.  There's a series of things we need to do
now; none of them will be decisive on their own, but together they
will have an enormous impact.  I think it's only fair to let you throw
the first punch against the enemy.  Are you willing?"
</p>

<p>
He looked at me suspiciously.  "What would I have to do?"
</p>

<p>
"You have Wish now, right?" I asked.  I waited for his cautious nod
and then passed him the first piece of paper.  "I'd like you to Wish
for this."
</p>

<p>
He scanned its contents very carefully before saying anything else.  I
watched his eyes move over the page, skimming once to get the sense of
it, then going back for a detailed read, then another.
</p>

<p>
"What's this bit?" he demanded, pointing at one particular phrase.
</p>

<p>
I craned my neck around until I could read the bit he was pointing at.
"Oh, that.  It's the name of a number.  A very, <em>very</em> large
number."
</p>

<p>
"How large?" he demanded suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
I thought about how best to describe the mind-boggling hugeness that
was Graham's number.
</p>

<p>
"Well, if you were to write a single digit on every atom in the
universe, you still wouldn't be able to write out this number," I told
him.  Which was true, but a gross oversimplifaction.  Writing one
digit per <em>Planck volume</em>, you still couldn't write it out,
much less writing it on something as enormous as an atom.
</p>

<p>
"What's an atom?" he asked, still suspicious.
</p>

<p>
"An atom is&mdash;" I paused, suddenly envisioning what a round of yak
shaving this could lead to.  I imagined trying to fit an entire high
school science education into one conversation and shuddered at the
thought.  "An atom is something so small that you can't see it.  If a
grain of sand were the size of a planet, then an atom would be the
size of a grain of sand.  Does that help?" It wasn't an accurate
comparison, but it would do.
</p>

<p>
"So it's the size of a planet?" he asked.  "I thought you said it was
small?"
</p>

<p>
I paused, confused for a moment, until I realized that yes, my analogy
could be seen as ambiguous if you were suspicious enough.  
</p>

<p>
"Forget atoms, they aren't relevant," I tried.  "I was just using them
as an example, If you wrote one digit on every grain of sand in
existence, you couldn't write out Graham's number.  Is that clearer?"
</p>

<p>
"So, to confirm," he asked, still suspicious.  "This very large number
will not, in any way, explode?"
</p>

<p>
I laughed.  It was the wrong response and I <em>knew</em> it was the
wrong response, but I couldn't help it.  "Nope, no explosions," I told
him.  "I'll be standing right next to you the whole time, no worries."
</p>

<p>
His eyes narrowed. "And you're not just trying to drain off all my
experience?"
</p>

<p>
I shook my head firmly.  "Nope.  The whole point is to make an XP
battery so that you&mdash;none of you&mdash;need to burn XP in the
future when we want to Wish stuff up."
</p>

<p>
He gave me a final hairy eyeball but seemed to accept it.  "Fine.  But
it won't work the way you wrote it.  I'd have to supply the experience
points myself, and I don't have them."
</p>

<p>
I froze.  How in the world had I missed such an obvious flaw?  In my
mind's eye, every single plan that I'd had took a firey kamikaze dive
into the midden.  They had <em>all</em> depended on having basically
free XP to throw around.
</p>

<p>
Isaac was watching me closely, and he seemed to find my appalled
expression reassuring.  He snorted and waved me off.
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry, it's a perfectly manageable situation," he said
dismissively.  <em>"Gate,"</em> he declaimed, his voice making the
universe shiver around us as a hole unzipped itself in reality.
</p>

<p>
"Count Zephyr, Crafter of the Forty Cakes of the Wind Emperor's
Banquet, I choose you!" Isaac called into the rift.
</p>

<p>
A shadow moved behind the world-hole, and a giant figure hovered into
sight.  From the waist up, it&mdash;rather, <em>he</em>&mdash;had the
body of a muscular Middle Eastern man, while below the waist he was
just a swirling cone of smoke.  His chin was clean shaven, but his
upper lip was graced by ferociously red mustachioes, each a full yard
long.  He wore them tied behind his head, presumably to keep them out
of the way while he baked.  (I was guessing about the baking based on
the chef's hat, the white apron, the flour all over his hands, and the
stirring spoon tucked at a jaunty angle through the belt of his
apron.)
</p>

<p>
Count Zephyr looked at Isaac and frowned.
</p>

<p>
"What?" he demanded.  "Hurry it up, I've got a souffle in the oven."  
</p>

<p>
Isaac cleared his throat.  "My Lord, your peer Duke Alaros recently
made a bargain with my Emperor: grant one Wish in the spirit that it's
intended, and you may have the other two for yourself.  I offer you
the same bargain; do you accept?"
</p>

<p>
Zephyr raised an eyebrow, then shrugged.  "Why wouldn't I?  I heard
about that deal; it worked out pretty well for Alaros, and I wouldn't
mind getting some of that for myself."  He paused.  "Well, it worked
out well for him up until the point where he had to talk the King out
of not stuffing him in a bottle and pitching him into the ocean when
Ilara came to bitch about how he'd been cycling Wishes.  Anyway, I
won't do that part.  So, what did you want, mortal?"
</p>

<p>
Isaac eyed him thoughtfully.  "To be clear, My Lord: the bargain I
offer is that you will grant me one Wish and, if I am satisfied that
it was granted according to the spirit of the Wish, then I will use
the other two Wishes in whatever way you desire.  Do you accept this
bargain?"
</p>

<p>
Zephyr grinned.  "Heh.  Busted!  Very well, I accept the bargain.
What is your Wish, mortal?"
</p>

<p>
Isaac studied the paper in his hand and then read it aloud,
enunciating carefully as he went.  "I am imagining a Wondrous Item
that I shall call an Earring of Experience.  It is a magically
invulnerable clip-on platinum earring.  It does not take a magic item
slot, and it has two powers: first, it contains Graham's number of
experience points, which anyone touching the Earring can draw upon for
three purposes: to pay for casting a spell that requires XP, to pay
for crafting a magic item, or to imbue them into a spell engine so
that the spell engine can cast a spell which requires XP.  The Earring
cannot be recharged and can only be used on a given spell engine once.
</p>

<p>
"The second power of the Earring," he continued, enunciating each word
clearly, "is that it goes with any outfit and makes the wearer look
seriously badass.  I wish to have an Earring of Experience clipped to
my right ear right now."
</p>

<p>
Even the Landguard took a half step back in surprise as we all
recognized just how seriously badass Isaac was.
</p>

<p>
"Day-um, Isaac, you look seriously badass!" I told him admiringly.
</p>

<p>
He Prestidigitated up a cheap mirror and studied his reflection
carefully.  "I don't know that this was worth a thousand experience
points," he groused.  "I do like the look, though."
</p>

<p>
"Betcha the ladies like it too," I suggested mischieviously.  That
earned me a thoughtful look and a quiet 'hmmmmmm.'
</p>

<p>
"<em>Ahem,</em>" said Count Zephyr.  "Souffle in the oven, remember?
Wish me up a couple of Rings of Three Wishes so I can get back before
it falls."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course," Isaac responded briskly.  "I Wish for a Ring of
Three Wishes.  I Wish for a Ring of Three Wishes."  He politely
extended the Rings to Count Zephyr; the Count took them with a pleased
expression.  He eyed them for a moment, tried them on, then removed
them and tucked them into a pocket of his apron.
</p>

<p>
"Can't have them falling off in the dough," he mumbled absently.
"Just have to remember not to leave them in the apron."  He turned for
the Gate, then glanced back at Isaac.  "It's been a pleasure, mortal.
Let me know if you want to do business again in the future."  With
that, he passed through the rift, which zipped itself closed behind
him.
</p>

<p>
There was silence for a long time while we all considered what had
just happened.
</p>

<p>
"Ok then, moving on!" I declared firmly.  "Here's the second Wish," I
told Isaac, passing over the next piece of paper.  "Use the Earring to
pay for it."  Again he studied it as carefully as though it were a
legal contract drawn up by Satan; honestly, it was starting to hurt my
feelings.  Eventually, however, he was satisfied.
</p>

<p>
"I am imagining a magic item that I will call a Bedroll Gnome," he
began.  "This is a statue of a gnome one foot high, made of magically
invulnerable copper.  It is imbued with one googolplex experience
points.  As long as it is standing upright, it casts a Wish every
round in order to create a Fortifying Bedroll.  It uses the experience
points that were imbued into it to pay for this.  The Fortifying
Bedroll will appear in the nearest available space that is not farther
from the Bedroll Gnome than fifty feet, nor closer than twenty.  I
Wish to have an upright Bedroll Gnome on the ground where I am
pointing."
</p>

<p>
A few feet in front of Isaac, a small copper lawn ornament appeared,
complete with pointy hat and long beard.  In its hands were a pair of
knitting needles, and next to its foot was a skein of copper yarn.  The
needles clicked and clacked and, within seconds, there was a rolled up
sleeping bag a few yards from the Gnome.
</p>

<p>
"I Wish that were a Fortifying Bedroll!" cried the Gnome in a squeaky
chipmunk voice.  A wash of magic flowed from its mouth and sank into
the bedroll.  The fabric glowed bright blue for a moment, then settled
down and looked normal again.
</p>

<p>
Immediately, the needles began clicking again.
</p>

<p>
"Impressive," Reynard said.  "But it will only produce a few thousand
Bedrolls per day and, in order to maximize the usefulness of the new
casters, they would each need to have one.  The Gnome can keep up with
one of the FLEAs, but we are setting up more as quickly as possible.
Wishing for another of these every time we create a new FLEA seems
inefficient."
</p>

<p>
I grinned savagely.  "Oh no," I told him.  "Arros said it was okay if
I automated production of these, and I am going to automate
the <em>hell</em> out of it.  Here, your turn." I passed him the third
sheet of paper and gestured for Isaac to hand over the Earring.
Reluctantly, he did.
</p>

<p>
Reynard scanned the page and laughed.  "I am envisioning a magic item
that I will call a Bedroll Gnome Gnome," he said.  "It is a statue of
a gnome one foot high, made of magically invulnerable silver.  It is
imbued with one googolplex to the googolplex power experience
points. As long as it is standing upright, it uses these experience
points to cast a Wish every round.  This Wish creates an upright
Bedroll Gnome imbued with one googolplex experience points.  This
Bedroll Gnome will appear in the nearest available space that is
within ten feet of the Bedroll Gnome Gnome. I Wish to have a Bedroll
Gnome Gnome standing upright on the ground where I am pointing."
</p>

<p>
Immediately there was a solid silver lawn ornament standing there,
holding a tiny hammer with an anvil at its feet.  The arm went up and
down like a clockwork automaton, tapping the hammer on the anvil.
After a few seconds it cried "I Wish for a Bedroll Gnome imbued with
one googolplex experience points!"  <em>Bam!</em> there was a second
copper Gnome in front of us.  Each one promptly spat out a Fortifying
Bedroll.
</p>

<p>
I wasn't done yet, though.  The golden Bedroll Gnome Gnome Gnome
followed, spitting out a continuous stream of Bedroll Gnome Gnomes
which spat out Bedroll Gnomes, which spat out Fortifying Bedrolls.
All of the Gnomes were strictly constrained so as to prevent
Sorceror's Apprentice syndrome (aka 'gray goo'), but the limitations
were pretty generous and production kept ramping up and up and up.  We
watched silently for a few minutes until the mound of Fortifying
Bedrolls got so high that it started tipping.
</p>

<p>
"Better get some people in here to railgun these over to the new
casters and distribute them," I said.  There were silent nods but no
one moved; the whole process was mesmerizing in its implacable growth.
</p>

<p>
Eventually Thomas shook it off and dispatched a Sending; minutes later
(and tens of thousands of Bedrolls), a gaggle of people arrived and
started bucket-brigading Bedrolls out of there.  It required
a <em>lot</em> of peope; one line was by no means enough.  Eventually,
the piles of Bedrolls got so high that there was nowhere for new
Bedrolls to appear within the limits of the Gnomes.  At that point the
lines of people started decreasing the pile a bit...only to have it
fill up again the instant there was free space.  Eventually they hit
on the idea of throwing a net over several dozen Bedrolls and moving
them all as a unit; that let them keep up a bit better, but the Gnomes
were still way ahead.
</p>

<p>
"You know, I had thought about going platinum and having a Bedroll
Gnome Gnome Gnome Gnome cranking out Gnome Gnome Gnomes," I said
absently.  "I decided that would be overkill, though."
</p>

<p>
Thomas snorted.  "'There's no kill like overkill'," he quoted.  He
paused, studying the regiment of magic item makers before us.  "But,
in this case...yes, overkill."
</p>

<p>
I gave a distracted snort at the humor; after another moment, I
managed to shake myself out of the awed trance caused by what we had
wrought.  "Ok," I said, clapping my hands to startle everyone else out
of their absorption.  "Now the casters only need an hour of sleep
instead of eight before they can memorize, so can get them online in
two hours instead of nine.  What's the next issue?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Spellbooks," Isaac said immediately.  "The new casters received first
level spellbooks when they initially became wizards, but those books
only contain the usual cantrips and first level spells.  In order to
use these new casters at their maximum potential, they will require
complete spellbooks.  It would take weeks or months to produce even
one full spellbook the normal way, so we should automate it."
</p>

<p>
"The same for prayerbooks," Drifa put in.  "The archivists are useless
without books."
</p>

<p>
I nodded, grimacing in distaste at what had to happen next.  "Reynard,
sorry, but we'll need a consult on this one," I told him regretfully.
</p>

<p>
He shrugged acceptance and allowed his eyes to blink closed.  Fragment
opened them.
</p>

<p>
<strong>"What?"</strong> it demanded.
</p>

<p>
Quickly, we explained what we wanted with the spellbooks.  While we
were at it, we asked about several further ideas that each of us had
come up with.
</p>

<p>
It considered for a moment.  <strong>"The normal magical items are
acceptable, so long as you do not supply them to outsiders.  They must
remain in the possession of your people.</strong> It turned to me with
a stern look.  <strong>"Do not think to play games with me by
temporarily adopting outsiders into your fold and then releasing them,
or in any other way working around my directives,"</strong> it
admonished.
</p>

<p>
Damn, it knew me too well; I <em>had</em> actually been thinking about
that.  "No worries," I told it, raising my hands placatingly.
"Message received and understood, will comply.  No funny business, I
promise."
</p>

<p>
Fragment eyed me for a moment, then nodded.  <strong>"You may not
create spell engines to run your...'FLEA',"</strong> it said, a
perceptible measure of distaste creeping into its inhumanly
dispassionate voice as it said the name.  <strong>"Allowing you to
increase the power of your mortals so trivially is enough; you may not
render it costless.  As to the books of magic...your plans are
acceptable, so long as you do not create the books such that they
contain any spells that are not already in your possession."</strong>
</p>

<p>
This was better than I'd hoped for.  Every time a wizard leveled up we
got two new spells added to Gr&#491;fhamr's repertoire.  We'd been
assigning people their choices, so by now we had pretty much every
known spell available to us.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Fragment," I told it sincerely.  "We'll stay within your
restrictions."  I paused, then realized what Fragment <em>wasn't</em>
doing.  "Could we please have Reynard back now?" I asked tentatively.
</p>

<p>
Fragment had neither facial expressions nor real body language;
nonetheless, it seemed to exude reluctance.  Finally, it
announced <strong>"Very well.  I suppose the same arguments still
apply,"</strong> and allowed Reynard back out to play.
</p>

<p>
I whewed in relief.  Was it possible that, one of these days, Fragment
was going to decide it didn't want to go to sleep again, even if that
was contrary to Arros's interests?  That would be scary...both because
it would mean that Reynard had been eaten and because I didn't want a
semi-god jostling my elbow every five minutes.
</p>

<p>
Reynard didn't seem bothered by it and, buoyed by his resilience, we
got immediately to work.  Within a few minutes we had a golden Arcane
Spellbook Printer Printer Printer printing out silver Printer Printers
which printed copper Printers which printed spellbooks.  The Divine
Prayerbook Printer Printer Printers, Printer Printers, and Printers
were set up a hundred yards away.  In both cases, the Printers took
any written arcane/divine spells within fifty feet&mdash;spellbooks,
scrolls, etc&mdash;and generated a spellbook that was a compilation of
all those spells.
</p>

<p>
It took about ten thousand people-hours to scrounge up a full set of
both arcane and divine spells; fortunately, it was easy to put our
hands on forty thousand people who were just sitting around waiting
for tasks.  Once everything was collected, we dumped a few armfulls of
books and scrolls near the first of the Printers, got the compilation,
and used the compilation as the seed for successive rounds while we
sent the scrolls and spellbooks back to their owners.  Having learned
our lesson, commoner railguns were set up to distribute the books
right from the start.  They still weren't able to keep up.
</p>

<p>
The next thing we created was a whole series of spell engines casting
Mage's Private Sanctum to keep scrying eyes away from what we were
doing.  Other item production lines followed: Dust of Dryness, Rings
of Regeneration, chunks of adamantite with hundreds of Explosive Runes
carved into them, Celestial Brilliance clusterbombs, and various
others.  There were also a whole series of lines dedicated to
producing the gear for the Landguard; Thomas insisted on managing
those in secret, arguing that part of the Landguard's effectiveness
was that no one else knew the complete list of their capabilities. I
didn't entirely buy it, but I also didn't care enough to argue, so I
let him have his secrets.
</p>

<p>
The preliminaries taken care of, I moved on to the thing that had me
the most excited.  "Ladies and gentlemen," I announced in my best
circus barker impression.  "Children of all ages, I give you: the
Potentiation Of Personnel Engine!  Yes, it slices, it dices, it makes
julienne fries!  But wait, there's more!  It can cut through a tin can
and still boost your strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity,
constitution <em>and</em> charisma like this!  <em>Now</em> how much
would you pay?!"
</p>

<p>
I hadn't really expected comprehension, but the lack of it still made me
homesick. My level of cultural isolation was amazing.
</p>

<p>
"It's simple," I told them more calmly.  "We set up a production line
for spell engines that give people five points to every stat.  It
gives us stronger, faster, smarter, <em>better</em> soldiers and
casters.  Smarter, wiser, and more charismatic means more spells per
day.  Stronger, faster, and tougher means they hit harder and last
longer than any other soldier.  Best of all, I can finally get some
enhancements myself!  Some Wisdom and Charisma boosts will make this
job so much easier; I've been holding off on it for a while now
because I didn't want to rely on magic items for those things when
they can be lost or turned off so easily, but now that Wishes are
cheap, there's no reason not to."
</p>

<p>
In truth, "didn't want to rely on magic items" was understating the
case quite a bit.  After my experience with having my Headband of
Intellect turned off, I'd been terrified of anything that might get me
semi-lobotomized like that; inherent bonuses were much safer.  I know
Albrecht had said there were classes in how to deal with that sort of
thing, but it seemed like an unappealing thing to study, and it wasn't
like I had a lot of time free for undergoing what would basically be
aversion therapy.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
I was bouncing on my toes with excitement, ready to make it happen.
The various expressions of impressed, surprised, curious, concerned,
and excited on the faces around me were just background scenery at
this point; I was much too excited to care what anyone else said.  I
was going to do this, by Flying Spaghetti Monster!
</p>

<p>
Isaac and Reynard were long out of Wish spells for the day, so I asked
Thomas the now-suddenly-an-Archmage-twice-over to handle it.  He
declined, citing a desire to keep his and the other Landguard's
spellcasting ability available for their primary mission: keeping my
sometimes-thoughtless keister intact.  I was thoroughly onboard with
that mission, so I chased up the new Archmage Cullen and had him do
it.
</p>

<p>
By now we'd come up with a template for wording the Wishes, and found
more efficient methods than what we'd been using.  What
we <em>had</em> been doing was to create the engines in order of their
metaness&mdash;the one that made what we wanted, the one that made
something that made what we wanted, and finally the one that made
something that made something that made what we wanted.  Turns out,
that was completely backwards.  Given that we wanted to make POPEs, it
was more efficient to create the POPE Engine Engine and let it create
the POPE Engine, and let that create the POPE.  Doing it that way
took one Wish instead of three.
</p>

<p>
The final product of all this was not elegant, but it worked.  The
POPE looked something like a Gatling gun: five long straight tubes
tied together in a bundle like the barrels on a machinegun, and the
whole thing resting on a tripod. Each barrel was actually a separate
spell engine that used a Wish to add one to the target's Strength or
whatever.  Together, the five barrels would bump your stat by five
points in a single round.  I would have preferred to make it a fifty
or one hundred point boost, but that wasn't an option: by Rules As
Written, it was only possible to get a plus five inherent boost (i.e.,
the kind that Wish gave).  Still, five points was huge when the normal
human range was three to eighteen.
</p>

<p>
As with all the other engines we'd been creating, we were careful to
keep it limited: each POPE would only affect someone standing exactly
five feet in front of it, it only worked when all three legs of the
tripod were on a solid surface, and there was a switch at the back
that would turn the whole thing off.  We didn't want to accidentally
leave it running and have some wild animal, dragon, or vacationing
elder abomination walk through the point of focus and get smarter and
stronger and so on.  Just by way of example, can you imagine the
damage that could be caused by a cat of superfeline strength and
intelligence?  Within days, it would go from pooping in your shoes to
strapping you into a Skinner box and conditioning you to open a tin of
cat food whenever the cat salivated.
</p>

<p>
Once we had all six kinds of POPEs set up, we started marching people
through them.  Unlike with the production lines, the steadily
increasing number of POPEs was a good thing rather than an
inconvenience: instead of bottlenecking in front of a single source
point, the steady spread of the POPEs gave more and more places that
people could run through to get augmented.  In not very long at all we
had run a small but noticeable fraction of Gr&#491;fhamr's population
through&mdash;less than 1%, but climbing steadily.
</p>

<p>
My original plan was to go through as soon as the POPEs were
available, but that got quashed.  The Landguard were understandably
nervous about letting me get boosted, given what had happened the last
time my mind had been magically modified.  (Well, the last time
that <em>they</em> knew about; they were thinking of the mindwhammy
Isaac and the others had put on me, not of the Intelligence boosts I
had Wished for myself.)  Thomas flatly refused to let me get any
boosts until at least a hundred people had gone through the process
and had had no problems for a full day.  I argued with him, but my
heart wasn't really in it: I remembered all too clearly how I had
tried to smash my skull open after Wishing myself smarter.  I really
wasn't interested in having that happen again.  I resigned myself to
waiting patiently; in the meantime, I started looking to other
possibilities.

<p>
<strong>"No.  It is not permitted."</strong>
</p>

<p>
"But it would be great!  We could parallelize everything much more if
there were more versions of you around!  And you'd have multiple
versions of yourself available, so you'd get more viewpoints on a
given event, making it easier to judge!"
</p>

<p>
<strong>"No.  You are <em>not</em> creating Ice Assassins of me."</strong>
</p>

<p>
Sigh.  "Ok, fine."
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
"Hey, can we create a production line of spell engines that create
bits of dust imbued with Permanent Celestial Brilliance so that we can
flood the entire world with undead-destroying light?"
</p>

<p>
<strong>"No."</strong>
</p>

<p>
"Why not?"
</p>

<p>
<strong>"There is a truce between the gods and the rulers of the outer
planes.  Were the entire world to become unsafe for their kind, it
would be seen as a violation of the treaty and they would wage war
against the gods...and all of the Prime Material."</strong>
</p>

<p>
Sigh.  "Ok, fine."
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
"Hey, can we use Diplomacy checks to convert all the undead into loyal
members of our side and then have them sacrifice everything they know
and all of their secrets to Herr&uacute;n and then kill themselves?"
</p>

<p>
<strong>"No."</strong>
</p>

<p>
"How about just converting them to our side?"
</p>

<p>
<strong>"No.  The undead are the children of Neklos.  You may not turn
his children against him."</strong>
</p>

<p>
Sigh.  "Ok, fine."
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
"Hey, can we&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
<strong>"No."</strong>
</p>

<p>
"Oh come on, you didn't even hear what I was going to ask!"
</p>

<p>
<strong>"You were going to ask if it was acceptable to use Mindscrape
to gather all the knowledge of all the residents of Gr&#491;fhamr into
each of the Ice Assassins and then have the creatures sacrifice all of
that to Herr&uacute;n.  No."</strong>
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
<strong>"No."</strong>
</p>

<p>
"Aw, man.  You never let me have <em>any</em> fun."
</p>

<p>
<strong>"Cope."</strong>
</p>

<p>
Sigh.  "Ok, fine."
</p>

<p>

<p>
We took a break for lunch and then checked on how many people had been
blessed by the POPE.  The answer was encouraging: even with needing to
run through six separate POPEs to get the full benefit, it was just
shattering how much of an impact self-replicating magic items could
have.
</p>

<p>
Moods much improved, we got ready for the raid on Hammond's crypt.
Newly stat-boosted and level-grinded (level ground?) or not, taking on
a lich on his home ground was not something to be half-assed about.
Fortunately, I knew how to bring our whole ass into it.
</p>

<p>
It took several hours to get everything set up&mdash;we were sending
some of the new casters along with the Landguard as a way to get them
some combat experience that was, if not <em>safe</em>, then at least
safer than going into direct combat against Afi's troops.
Furthermore, we were asking them all to do something difficult and
uncomfortable, and it took a while to explain the exact reasons.
Eventually though, everyone was in place, the last warnings had been
given, and everything was ready.
</p>

<p>
"Good luck," I told the recently-he-was-an-enemy hotheaded arrogant
obnoxious vampire wizard upon whom all our hopes rested.  He didn't
deign to reply, just gave me a crisp nod and raised his arms
dramatically.
</p>

<p>
"Greater Teleport!" Colborn cried.

<em>The blurb for "One Hot Night" is:</em>
</p>
<p>
"In a society without death, Ingfred is 20 years old and has no
prospects. All the good jobs are filled by undying masters of their
craft, and it's hard to be taken seriously when you are, compared to
everyone around you, an infant.  Fortunately, he has a solution:
undergo an illegal transformation and sell the memory to The
Experiental Herald for a ridiculous sum.
</p>

<p>
There's two problems: how can Ingfred convince a powerful wizard to
risk his mage license and his freedom to help with such a crazy plan?
And, once that's done...how will Ingfred deal with the law?"
