<p>
An hour later the whole castle was in an uproar; servants and soldiers
were running in and out with cartloads of maps, land deeds, blank
parchment, alchemical products, fancy inks made from bizarre and
expensive materials, quills made from roc feathers, scores of barrels
of lamp oil, dozens of long trestle tables, hundreds of chairs, and
weirder stuff.  Hordes of people followed them&mdash;several hundred
mages and what looked like a completely random selection of citizens.
There were blacksmiths, entertainers, butchers, bakers (but, sadly, no
candlestick makers), men and women, teenagers and grandparents.  So
many different types of people, all with one very important skill in
common.  One skill that would, hopefully, make the difference that we
so desperately needed.
</p>

<p>Cannon production continued apace.  The ones we had already built
were deployed throughout the city; basically, we put them whereever
there was enough empty space for lots of soldiers to appear out of
nowhere and start stabbing us all in the face.  Well, most of the
places.  Well, some of the places&mdash;ok, fine, a few of the places.
It was the best we could do; there were too many places and not enough
cannon.
</p>

<p>
Thomas was acting like a hen with one chick; I went nowhere without a
literal wall of bodyguards wrapped around me, swords drawn at all
times.  Noone was allowed within ten feet of me, and they were
checking my food for poison practically bite-by-bite. Two of the
Landguard were asleep at any time, with the other six all within three
feet of me...even when I had to go to the bathroom.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't this all a bit extreme?" I asked when I was done; having not
one but two heavily armed bodyguards sweep the crapper for threats
before I could pee was just a bit surreal...especially when they then
stayed in the room with me while I did my thing.  (I now have a deeply
personal acquiantance with the phrase "shy bladder.")  It also didn't
help that Suze was taking her new "personal assistant" job seriously
and was always right at my elbow; I had to tell her three times that
no, she did not need to come into the bathroom with me.  For such a
mousy girl, she could be awfully stubborn.
</p>

<p>
I started along the corridor, looking at Thomas and waiting
expectantly for his answer.  My guards immediately dropped into place
around us.  As we paced along, Thomas looked at me, blank-faced and
finally responded to my question with a simple "No.  It is not
extreme."  He sounded like the Pope speaking <em>ex cathedra</em>:
correct by definition.  "The Deorsi will launch a decapitation strike
within two days.  They must have good intelligence on our government
and military by now, from prisoners and the population of their
captured cities.  They'll know that killing you would demoralize the
common man and would also remove a dangerous unknown from their
planning.  I assume they're at least as smart as I am, so they won't
wait to launch an assassination attempt.  I certainly didn't."
</p>

<p>
I blinked at that.  "You ordered an assassination?  Aren't you
a paladin?  Lawful Good?"
</p>

<p>
He looked at me like he was fitting me for a dunce cap.  "The Land,
the Law, the ruler.  I'd be failing in my duty if I didn't use every
tactic and tool available."
</p>

<p>
I was surprised, but it made sense; I guess paladins don't actually
have to be Lawful Stupid after all.  And it wasn't really an
assassination per se...this was a war, it was a legitimate strike
against military leadership. Assassination or not, it was certainly a
more pragmatic&mdash;and effective&mdash;attitude than any paladin
that I'd ever gamed with.  "So what did you do?"
</p>

<p>
"Two of the Special Units with a focus on stealth are going to sneak
in while a squad of Landguard and a blaster-heavy Special Unit act as
a diversion.  The stealth squads have orders to infiltrate the Deorsi
encampment and take out their senior mages."
</p>

<p>
"That sounds...tricky," I told him, looking for a nicer word than
'insane', which was the first one that came to mind.  It was a camp
full of eighty thousand highly alert professional soldiers that
doubtlessly kept sentries and magical alarms and wards and guard
animals, oh my.  
</p>

<p>
He shrugged, stone-faced.  "It's a suicide mission.  They all know it.
They also know that it's necessary.  Without the Deorsi's magical
superiority, we may have a chance."
</p>

<p>
I nodded.  I wish I was more bothered by it but, honestly, I wasn't.
I had never met those people and therefore their fate did not activate
the ancestral brain-machinery concerned with protecting the tribe.
Instead, I could see the cold logic of it.  I still wasn't about to
say anything stupid like "Well, that'll help" since Thomas probably
knew all of those people closely and his ancestral brain-machinery
probably <strong>was</strong> activated.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry for your loss," I said quietly.  He gave the tiniest little
twitch of the lips in acknowledgement.
</p>

<p>
An awkward silence fell for a long minute.  Then a horrible thought
occurred to me.  "If we can resurrect the Landguard, can't they
resurrect their mages?"
</p>

<p>Thomas' lips twisted in a pleased smile.  "They could.  If their
mages were dead.  And they knew that."</p>

<p>I gaped in amazement.  "You're going to replace them, aren't you?
You're going to replace their highest level mages and use them as
double agents, aren't you?"</p>

<p>For a moment he stayed stone-faced, and then a sly smile broke
out and he nodded.</p>

<p>"Ok, that is so full of awesome I can't even tell you.  But how are
they going to pass?  All of the other mages and orderlies and military
commanders must know them well."</p>

<p>
His grin got wider.  "It's amazing what magic can do for a stealth
mission.  To get in with you have Boots of Elvenkind, Invisibilty,
Silence...lots of things.  And once you're in, you disguise yourself
as the person.  If you have decent ranks in Disguise and Bluff, and
you aren't too different from your target, then you can pile up Alter
Self, Change Self, Polymorph, and Veil. Anyone trying to see through
your disguise needs to hit a DC of 72.  Sure, people who are intimate
with the target get +10 on their Spot check but so what?  Some of the
spells will run out after an hour or two, but most of them will last
plenty long enough.  Limit contact and you can keep the charade going
for days."
</p>

<p>It was simply too awesome for words.  Apparently I had been wrong;
I wasn't in a D&D fanfic, I was in the most shatteringly awesome Tom
Clancy novel ever&mdash;or maybe a Robert Ludlum <em>Bourne</em>
novel.  But then I kept thinking through the consequences.</p>

<p>
"But it won't really work, will it?  Or, at least, it won't work long
enough.  They'll figure it out and then they'll resurrect the mage or
mages that we replace."
</p>

<p>
After a moment he nodded.  "Yes.  If we kill them and then replace
them, it'll buy time but it won't actually stop them.  When you've got
clerics capable of casting True Resurrection&mdash;and we need to
assume that they do&mdash;it's essentially impossible to kill someone
dead enough.  Even a sphere of annihilation will allow them to be
brought back through divine intervention, and Miracle will allow
that. But, if the Specials can keep the masquerade going long enough,
that'll give us a chance&mdash;especially if they can relay
intelligence or misdirect the enemy.
</p>

<p>
"But killing the mages is just the fallback strategy; plan A is to
kidnap them.  Prevent them from casting, keep their spell book away
from them, and they're helpless.  And because they aren't dead, they
can't be resurrected.  They need to be kept protected from scrying so
the enemy can't launch a rescue, but that's manageable."
</p>

<p>I had a sick feeling that I didn't want to know, but I wanted to
know.  "How do you keep them from casting?"</p>

<p>He shrugged.  "Most wizard spells require either verbal or somatic
components.  A wizard needs a functioning tongue and hands to manage
those."  He paused for a long, cruel minute; I'm pretty sure he did it
just to mess with me.  "Of course, a Feeblemind spell will work even
better, if you have one handy."  He grinned, knowing he'd gotten
me.</p>

<p>
An idea way at the back of my brain raised its hand, asking permission
to stand up in front of the class.  Before I could get a good look at
it, though, we came to a walkway overlooking the castle bailey and
looked out.  Below us was a hive of activity, with multiple clusters
of people standing here and there talking intently.  At the many long
tables men and women sat shoulder to shoulder to shoulder, scribbling
on parchment at a furious pace.
</p>

<p>
I eyed all that for a moment and sighed.  "I just hope that this
works."
</p>

<p>Thomas nodded, staring blank-faced out at the activity in the
courtyard.  "Yes, let's."</p>

<center>o-o-o-o-o-o</center>

<p>
Although the Archmages and Thomas had a good plan&mdash;or
perhaps <em>because</em> they did&mdash;I felt the need to earn my
keep.  Yep, time to come up with something clever.
</p>

<p>It was exactly at this point that my mind went utterly blank.  I
spent the next several minutes mentally flailing around staring at
what my high school chemistry teacher used to call the No-Eye Deer.
Finally, when that failed to produce any sort of results whatsoever, I
backed up and made myself look at the problem more systematically.</p>

<p>If the Deorsi's next attack was anything like the last
one&mdash;and there was no reason to think it wouldn't be, since why
change a winning tactic?&mdash;then we could expect lots more troops,
without any warning, appearing at some random spot in the city.  We
couldn't stop them through sheer force of arms; we had been lucky to
stop them last time, even though we happened to have hundreds of
troops right on the spot along with the nastiest taser ever invented.
We needed some force multipliers; magic was the obvious choice, but it
was in limited supply.  What could be done with purely mundane items?
A lot of ideas stolen from modern warfare were non-starters because of
the lack of explosives in this world...although I could partially get
around that with magic such as Explosive Runes, but that kind of magic
was a limited resource and couldn't be produced in mass
quantities.</p>

<p>
That was when it hit me.  I needed something effective, using as
little magic as possible, and easily scalable so that it could be
deployed throughout the city.  And I knew exactly the thing.</p>

<p>"Suze, pass a message for me, would you?  I want at least a
thousand pounds of flour spread out in a thin layer at each of the
places where we expect the Deorsi might show up.  Also, I want as many
Portable Holes as we can scare up, and as many Bags of Holding as
possible, especially the big ones.  Bring 'em here to the castle and
sort them by size.  Also bring in half a dozen of the cannons and
their crews and ammo.  Finally, I need every mage that can teleport to
get out into the city and get familiar with the possible destinations.
Have each one of them look at the area twice, then move on.  That will
get them to the 'seen casually' level, and we don't have time for them
to spend an hour studying each of sixteen different locations."</p>

<p>She nodded and dashed off, returning a few minutes later with
several of the couriers in tow.  "I told Clay; he's the mage in charge
of coordinating the ones in the bailey.  He'll pass the word to find
the teleport mages.  I sent most of the servants out to find the
Portable Holes and Bags.  And I brought John, Derrik, and Jason with
me in case you have other orders to pass."</p>

<p>I smiled, pleased at her forethought.  "Thanks Suze, I should have
thought of that."</p>

<p>She blushed and ducked her head.  Clearly, we still needed to work
on that self-confidence.</p>

<p>That thought reminded me of Duncan, killed along with Robert, Rob,
Bob, and Aerith.  It was a sad thought, made only slightly easier by
the knowledge that they would be back once there was time enough for
all the necessary True Resurrections.</p>

<p>I forced my thoughts away from the missing men and back towards
thinking up as many nasty ideas for our inevitable invaders as I
could.  The ideas were starting to flow thick and fast, and I was
starting to feel a little more confident of our chances.</p>

<p>"Ok, Derrik," I said, turning to the pimple-faced teenage courier
that Suze had previously introduced.  "I want you to send a bunch of
people shopping for me, there's a few more things we'll need...."</p>

<p>The feverish work continued far into the night; each hour that
passed making our chances very slightly better.</p>
