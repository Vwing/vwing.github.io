  <title>The Two Year Emperor</title>
</head>
<body><a href=chapter_002.html>Previous</a><hr />

<p>After a long discussion and many plans proposed by yours truly (pretty much
all of which were shot down), we packed it in for the night and I trundled off
to bed.</p>

<p>Reynard and Thomas, coming from a world ruled by D&D rules instead of normal
biology, needed exactly eight hours of sleep to function effectively.  I was
used to sleeping seven, and could get by on five or six for a couple of nights.
Which didn't matter in the slightest, since I got no sleep at all that night; I
was on the edge of freaking out completely at the situation I was in.</p>

<p>Seriously?  I was supposed to rule a nation?  Plan a defense against a
powerful army when skilled generals saw no hope?  What the hell?  This was
insane.  Even better, they clearly weren't going to let me go, or return me to
Earth until my two years were up, so no matter what happened I was going to be
there for it.</p>

<p>Then again, when you come to think of it, that was a pretty powerful
motivator.</p>

<p>Ok, fine, I was stuck here.  Treat it like any project for a really,
<em>really</em> bitchy client; I'm good at projects, and at running
them.  It's what I do.  What did I know that could help?</p>

<p>I spent the rest of the night skimming the big compendium of spells in my
brain, jotting notes on various ideas, and going over everything I could
remember of the D&D rules, every rules break I'd ever discovered or read about,
every webcomic, fantasy novel, or blog post that could be helpful.  I also
talked to Allison for hours, getting her read on all the main people involved
in the government.
</p>

<p>
She gave me the same info that Thomas had, but with a different slant and
different details.  The ruler (me), could use whatever title he wanted; in the
last twenty years, Flobovia had had an Emperor, a Raj, a Sultan, a Poobah, a
Boss, a Throk, a President, another Emperor, a Khan, a Chief Widgeteer...and
now me.  Below me were six Dukes, about twenty Counts, several score Baronets,
and a couple hundred minor knights, lords, and so on.  She was less clear on
how many citizens there were, but she knew it was a lot.
</p>

<p>
And I got the answer to a minor but nagging point: why was there an Imperial
Justiciar system, a Royal Forest, and so on, all with different titles?
Simple; they were named according to the ruler that created them.  Duh.  Should
have seen that one.
</p>

<p>
It was a lot to soak in, but by the morning, I had gotten it mostly straight,
and had figured a few things out...one of which was that I felt utterly vile
from lack of sleep.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, it turns out that being the ruler of a fantasy kingdom has a few
perks, showers being one of them.  (Which answered my question from the
previous day.)
</p>

<p>
It was a pretty clever system, actually.  The walls and floor of the shower
were kept slightly warm by way of heat from a chimney that ran up the outside
of one wall.  The water flow was constant instead of being something that you
turned on or off; when I asked later, I was told that the showerhead was a
magic item containing a permanent two-inch-wide gate to the Elemental Plane of
Water.  When I stepped in, I discovered that the Elemental Plane of Water
should really be called the Elemental Plane of Holy-Crap-That's-Cold.  I yelped
and jumped out, my lips already going blue.
</p>

<p>
A snicker came from across the room.  Looking, I saw the flames on one of the
torches positively chortling.
</p>

<p>
"Allison?!" I yelped again, grabbing a towel and wrapping it around my waist.
"Hey, a little privacy, please?"
</p>

<p>
"Hey, I'm happy to go if you want, O Ye of the Rapidly Shrinking Manparts.  But
I don't think you're gonna like your shower very much if I do."
</p>

<p>
I wasn't going to take that grief, so I immediately skewered her on my rapier
wit.  "Uhhh...what?"  Hey, cut me some slack, I was up all night and hadn't had
a shower.
</p>

<p>
"Look, it's simple.  There's three options: I sit on the pipe and heat the
water up so you can get in there without your man-grapes actually retreating
back inside your body, or you take a freezing cold shower, or you have the
servants haul hot water and a tub up to you, which will take about an hour.
Your call; it's all the same to me."
</p>

<p>
I just stared at her.
</p>

<p>
She snickered.  "Don't worry, I've been doing this for five hundred years; you
ain't got nothing I haven't seen before.  And my binding prevents me yapping
about the size of your...feet."
</p>

<p>
I really had to weigh my practical desire to be clean and awake
against my desire to not be embarrassed by a snarky elemental seeing
me naked.  I took an internal vote and it narrowly came up in favor of
'practical'.  'Embarrassment' demanded a recount, but I told it to
shut up.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Allison, I'd really appreciate it.  Just...could you go easy on the
jokes?  I've already had a long week, and it's only my second day."
</p>

<p>
And so I got a deliciously hot shower while an intelligent campfire teased me
about my thinning hair and reminded me to wash behind my ears.  What a weird
world.
</p>

<p>
A few hours later, I was feeling much better; clean, refreshed, and dressed in
an elegant velvet outfit that had been laid out for me when I came out of the
shower.  There was even a valet to help me get it on, which proved to be a good
thing since the way it all fit together was baffling.  (Fortunately, codpieces
had gone out of vogue six months earlier, or I would have pitched a fit.)
</p>

<p>
I'd had a light breakfast and now we were out in the city.  There was no
specific plan or destination, I just needed to see what was out there.  I
thought it might give me some ideas, and I wanted a better sense of what this
place was like.  The idea of me wandering around on foot in the crowds gave
Thomas apoplexy, but he dealt with it.  I wanted to bring one or two of the
Landguard along to serve as guides.  Thomas wanted to send eight as close-in
protection, with twenty more sweeping nearby rooftops and higher-level rooms
for potential sniper nests.  We argued about it and it turned out that this was
one of the very few grey areas where his various oaths left him unsure where
his duty lay.  In the end though, I bargained him down to no long range
protectors and only four close-in ones.
</p>

<p>
Of course, these four looked like about twelve; they were absolutely huge men
carrying a variety of oversized weapons and generally looking like they could
win the Superbowl all on their own...without passing the ball or moving faster
than a walk.
</p>

<p>
"M'Lord, I'd like to introduce you to Sergeant Robert Greenlake, Healer
Specialist Rob Davidson, Mage Specialist Bob Guardson, and Guardian-First
Aerith.  They'll escort you for the day and serve as guides wherever you want
to go.  If there's something in particular you'd like to see, ask them and
they'll know where to find it."
</p>

<p>
I squinted at him, suspiciously.  "So...Robert, Rob, Bob, and Aerith?"
</p>

<p>
He nodded without so much as a twinkle in his eye.  "Yes, M'Lord."
</p>

<p>
I just shook my head.  "Right, of course.  Alas, poor sanity, we hardly knew
ye.  Come on, let's go."
</p>

<p>
I know it's a clich&eacute; but...the city was a place of wonders.
Buildings as high as eight levels (astounding for a medieval
technology level) and a few towers that went much higher; those were
mostly for wizards, astronomers, and other eccentrics.  Most of the
streets were absolutely pristine&mdash;none of the manure and dirt
that I had expected to see.  People riding magic carpets, flying on
broomsticks, pegasi, ornithopters, and even stranger things; a few
people were flying with no visible support at all.  Incredible art
everywhere; we passed fifteen large murals before I stopped counting,
many of the street signs were oil paintings in small glass boxes, or
elaborate metalwork, and even the poorest building had some sort of
gargoyle, scrollwork, engraving, or mural.  People of what seemed like
a hundred races went past, just going about their business.  Many of
them were races I was familiar with&mdash;elves, dwarves, halflings,
some half-breeds&mdash;but many were completely unfamiliar; eight-foot
bipedal scaly types with huge yellow snake eyes and four-inch talons
on hands and feet, furry five-foot-high starfish creatures who were so
shaggy it was hard to make out any details, two-torsoed centauroids,
the torsoes facing in opposite directions but each with an excessively
long, flexible neck that would allow them to turn to face each other,
and dozens of other species.
</p>

<p>
The buildings, like the inhabitants, came in a bewildering variety of
styles; large silk pavilions existed right next to multi-level wood
buildings that would have looked perfectly sensible in any rural
American town.  Every possible building material was being used
somewhere: terracotta, metal, stone, wood, cotton, silk&mdash;even
diamond and (apparently) actual forcefields.  Some of the last were
transparent, some were opaque; watching the inhabitants of the
transparent ones cook, read, and even undress was more than a bit
weird.
</p>

<p>"What's that thing?" I asked, pointing at a tiny blue wooden building, no
more than four feet square and seven feet high.</p>

<p>Bob looked where I was pointing.  "Dimensionally expanded
apartment&mdash;nice digs but not cheap," he said with a hint of envy in his
voice.</p>

<p>I smiled very slightly.  "So...it's bigger on the inside?"</p>

<p>He nodded.  "All the richest folks want them.  It's about the best security
you can get, and if you want more space you just hire a mage to come in and
push the spell out a bit."</p>

<p>"Makes sense," I responded, already distracted by the shifting
urban kaleidoscope around me.  I was looking around at the number of
people on the street with us and it was simply
astounding&mdash;probably as high as modern New York.</p>

<p>"How big is Capital City, anyway?"  That was still the stupidest name for a
city ever.  Then again, I suppose that back in the real world we named a major
city 'Oxford' just because it was next to a place in the river where bovines
could go wading.</p>

<p>Bob was right on the edge of gushing.  "It's about three miles wide and
eight miles long, and according to the last census we had just crossed the
million-person threshold."</p>

<p>"Fascinating reading, the census," commented Aerith with a
butter-wouldn't-melt-in-my-mouth tone.</p>

<p>"Very true," agreed Robert soberly.  "Important document for a bodyguard to
be familiar with.  You never know when a rampaging demographic will leap out
from a dark alley."</p>

<p>I laughed with them.  Jokes aside though, I couldn't get over the population
density; I couldn't be sure, but it looked like it was about as high as
Manhattan.  In the middle of a feudal society how did they grow enough food, or
produce enough goods?!  Ok, sure, magic had to figure in heavily, but I hadn't
expected there to be <em>that</em> many magi and magic items kicking around.
</p>

<p>
As we kept walking I periodically stopped to examine various random
things that caught my eye.  We walked into a tailor shop to find the
tailor filling out some paperwork&mdash;probably the bill of
sale&mdash;while an animated tape measure marked off all the relevant
dimensions of the customer and a floating scissors cut up cloth to be
sewn by several animated needles.  An elegant worsted wool suit flowed
into existence behind the needles.
</p>

<p>
A blacksmith had a stone kettle which served as his forge; instead of needing a
fire and bellows, he simply placed a piece of metal in the kettle where it
rapidly started to glow red, yellow, and finally white hot.  Throughout the
process, the kettle stayed&mdash;quite literally&mdash;stone cold.
</p>

<p>
The streets were lined with lightpoles inside which thousands upon thousands of
tiny sparks floated slowly.  Looking closer, I realized that they were produced
by tiny flying jellyfish no larger than my thumbnail.  Their bodies were hard
to see as they were almost perfectly clear, but their tentacles shifted wildly
through an array of colors which ended with a tiny flash of light.
</p>

<p>
We passed a fountain with water that appeared from midair as a downward-facing
jet twenty feet in the air, fell two feet, and then forked into gentle rain
pouring down into a marble catchment.  Not a single drop escaped the catchment,
although when I reached in, I was able to scoop some up in my hand and bring it
out with perfect ease; it was as pure and cold as glacier melt water.  The
catchment itself was covered with elaborate carvings of fauns, nymphs, and
woodland creatures done in such detail that I kept waiting for them to blink.
It had no drain, yet only contained about a foot of water no matter how much
fell.
</p>

<p>
Around the next corner we passed a temple; under an awning outside were a group
of clerics standing in front of a long line of raggedly-dressed people.  They
were offering food to everyone in the line, and healing to those with
significant wounds or diseases.  Minor wounds or sniffles were treated with
basic first aid, more serious things with magic.  Inside the temple, I could
hear young voices singing what was clearly an 'ABC...' song.  As we wandered
through the city, I realized that there were temples to a variety of gods, and
that every single one had an aid and teaching effort in place.
</p>

<p>
Continuing on, we came to a giant silk pavillion with its flap tied open.
Outside the "door" a heron made of silver metal perched on one leg singing a
crystalline love song.  Beside it stood a young brunette talking to a passing
man.  As he walked by, the woman looked sad for a moment until she noticed me
and my guards.  Suddenly a smile lit up her face and her entire appearance
shifted, flowing into a dusky-skinned Queen of India with long night-black hair
to her waist, elegant cheekbones and eyes you could drown in.  She was so
beautiful she might have stepped right out of one of my dreams.  She wore a
close-fitted dress of sheer black silk that flowed down her body like
rainwater, falling to her ankles and slit to the hip to show tantalizing
flashes of caramel leg.
</p>

<p>
"Won't you come in, good sir?" she purred to me in a throaty murmur.  "Robin
Yellowlake is the finest clothier in all Flobovia, with hand-made clothing fit
for the ruler himself.  You look so very handsome in your current apparel, good
sir, but it doesn't flatter you the way a Robin Yellowlake original would; you
could be so much more fetching in garb designed to enhance your powerful
aspect.  I can just picture you in a tunic of blue samite," she smiled and
shivered in delight.  "The ladies would be lining up at your door, good sir,
with myself at the head of the line.  Or perhaps&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Bob touched me on the arm.  "Come away, M'Lord.  It's a standard advertising
phatasm; it has a very slight hypnotic effect that forms itself to the precise
tastes of the viewer."
</p>

<p>
I blushed fiercely and turned away, hurrying on and praying that my escort had
not seen or heard what I had seen and heard; it was far too embarrassing.
</p>

<p>
As we wandered on through the city, I noticed a pattern; there was magic
everywhere and very little of it repeated, although there was a lot of overlap.
Coopers, tailors, smiths, haberdashers, potters -- all had some mage-crafted
way to produce goods faster, yet the precise means varied wildly.
</p>

<p>
When I asked about this, Robert responded, "Artificer magi have never
been common, M'Lord, but Flobovia has been around a long time; magic
items accumulate and useful ones get passed down through families."
</p>

<p>
I nodded understanding and, having seen enough, turned back towards the castle.
The guards shifted at the same time, smoothly maintaining their diamond
formation around me.
</p>

<p>
Two hours later, I was back sitting in the sitting room (was there a standing
room?), which had become my de facto war room.  We had a system going; I sat in
my chair by the fire while some poor schmuck who happened to be a sixth-level
wizard cast Major Image and kept it running, constantly updating it based on my
verbal commands and physical actions.  It made a fantastic map table /
whiteboard (and it was still a total blast playing Tony Stark with the little
hologram widgets).  A line of couriers sat around being very, very quiet.
Scribes furiously copied down everything I said, each assigned to various tasks
such as "copy the whiteboard" or "write the orders the couriers will carry."
It bordered on creepy but also kinda appealed to the side of me that had always
secretly thought being a minion-employing Evil Overlord would be fun.
</p>

<p>
If I had an idea, I turned to Thomas or Reynard to see if it would
work&mdash;the vast majority of my ideas didn't.  If there was some key fact
that none of us knew, a Sending would be dispatched or one of the couriers
would go sprinting off to get the answer.  The answer would arrive a few
minutes or an hour later, and some scribe would remind me of why I'd been
asking about this so I could finish the thought.
</p>

<p>
First off, my idea for hitting the Deorsi in their logistics and
letting them starve was DOA.  When I proposed it, Thomas and Reynard
pointed out&mdash;in much more diplomatic terms of course&mdash;that
it was a braindead idea, since the Deorsi weren't far enough away to
starve before they got to us.  Furthermore, even if they were far
enough away, they would simply raid the stored food of Flobovia to
make up their lack, leaving <em>our</em> people to starve.
</p>

<p>
That'll teach me not to slavishly copy Flint's Belisarius without thinking it
through.  (Although I did find myself wondering what a matchup between Thomas
and Valentinian would have looked like.)
</p>

<p>
There were some things that worked, though.  It was obvious that our wizards
were going to be the best source of game breakers to defeat the militarily
superior Deorsi, so I issued orders that every single wizard in the country was
summoned to the capital...only to discover that this had been put into effect a
few months ago, with only a few holdouts remaining in their towers.  I put some
oomph behind it, stating that any wizard who had not reported to the capital
and checked in with the Landguard within the next three days would be forever
denied access to the Capital City Library.  Since that library was the primary
repository of magical knowledge in the country, that was a pretty heavy threat.
As the carrot to go with the stick, I added that any wizard coming to the city
and accepting a geas to serve for the duration of the war would be allowed to
copy any and all known spells from the Library or from the spellbooks of other
wizards.
</p>

<p>
Reynard warned me that this mandatory spell sharing would make a lot of wizards
unhappy, as their income depended on selling spell information.  I told him I
really didn't care.
</p>

<p>
My second set of orders was for the purchase of several warehouses in the city.
Crime being what it was, warehouses were built like fortresses&mdash;no
windows, only one door and that was usually iron.  Once we sent a few dozen
clerics around to cast some Continual Flame spells as lighting, they made
pefect training arenas.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the first arena was ready, I would start cycling magi through in
groups: one group would use Monster Summoning spells to produce creatures that
the other group would fight in order to gain experience.  Even with low
Challenge Rating numbers, our wizards would level fast&mdash;probably multiple
times a day.  Of course, that was only possible because we would cheat; the
summoner has control of the summoned creatures, and could order them to stop
fighting for a couple rounds while the trainees got some free hits in, or to
stop completely if the trainees were in danger of dying.  By staggering the
sleeping shifts and having clerics on hand to heal the wounded, we would be
able to keep the training going 24 hours a day.
</p>

<p>
As other arenas came online, we would start training people other than wizards,
focusing first on clerics and finally on anyone who could swing a sword.
</p>

<p>
Of course, all that was part of my shinging vision for the future; for now, all
that was happening was the first warehouse was being bought or
commandeered&mdash;I told them I didn't care which, as long as we had it within
the next four hours.
</p>

<p> 
With the arena plan done I crossed my fingers and found a wizard who had
created a Dedicated Wright.  I needed to verify that it worked the way my
Brainopedia said&mdash;I could not afford to be wrong on this.  Dedicated
Wright was a fascinating spell&mdash;it produced a fat little cat-sized
homunculus made out of clay, designed to be left at home working on magic items
for its master while said master went off and killed non-human people and stole
their stuff.  The Wright had two nifty properties: first, creating one involved
casting an Arcane Eye on it which allowed the owner to see through its eyes at
any range.  The intent was to allow the owner to verify the progress on an
item, but I had some other uses in mind.
</p>

<p>
The other shiny thing about the Wrights was even shinier: by
concentrating, a wizard could make a Wright move around slowly or take
basic actions other than crafting magic items.  They couldn't do
anything fancy, just simple things like "go over there", or "pick that
up," but this simple little loophole was the absolute gamebreaker I'd
been looking for.  When I learned that I was right about the Wright, I
actually yelled "Woohoo!" and fistpumped.  "We've got'em now," I
muttered.  "Gonna make Niven's foot fall right on those schmucks, oh
yeah."  I snickered at my own pun.
</p>

<p>
People stared at me very strangely.  For a very long time.
</p>

<p>
Once I had gotten past my elation, I told Thomas to round up every Dedicated
Wright that could be found and to bring the Wrights and their magi directly to
the castle via teleport.
</p>

<p>
While waiting for the magi to arrive, I turned to production capacity.  It was
clear from what I'd seen in the city that Flobovia had no concept of
industrialization, although magic duplicated many of the labor-saving benefits
of technology.  They used Sending spells as telephones, scrying spells as TVs,
bound fire elementals as incinerators, bound earth elementals as forklifts,
Continual Flame spells as light bulbs, and so on.  Despite all that, there was
no way to produce huge piles of stuff, and I needed to fix that; I needed a LOT
of big stuff, and even more bits and bobs.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, I read The Order of the Stick, and I remembered Elan's primary use
(aside from comic relief): his Inspire Competence songs.  "Ok, we're going to
need to up our crafting capacity.  Here we go," I drew in mid air, glowing blue
lines following my fingers.  "Build a multi-level tower 60'x60'x60' with
lattice flooring.  Put a crafter and his equipment in the center.  Pack the
rest of it with a few hundred bards and have them use Inspire Competence on the
craft check; they're all within 30' of him and he can see and hear them all, so
he'll get a ridiculous bonus.  That should let us crank stuff out in a few
minutes.  Set up a few dozen of these, and we should be able to make hundreds
of thousands of crossbow bolts a day, thousands of suits of armor, and so on."
</p>

<p>
Having just moved an entire nation into its Industrial Revoltion without the
pollution, I took a moment to pat myself on the back.  Then, feeling smug, I
started to move on to the next problem...when I heard a slight noise behind me.
I shot a glance over my shoulder and saw one of the scribes looking
uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
"Yes?" I asked him.  I tried not to sound impatient, but my thoughts were
already elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
"My Lord, I wouldn't presume&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I frowned slightly and turned to face him properly.  "Spit it out," I told him
firmly.
</p>

<p>
He gulped, looking like a man about to be hanged.  "Ah, My Lord, the
tower...while an excellent idea, I regret to say it won't perform quite to your
expectations."
</p>

<p>
Now I was really impatient; sucking up annoyed me, as did distractions.  I
forced myself to sit on the feeling and smooth my affect out; there was clearly
an issue here, and terrifying the poor guy wouldn't help.
</p>

<p>
"It's ok, don't worry.  If it's not going to work, I need to know; I would much
rather be told that I'm wrong than have us waste time and resources.  So what's
the problem?"
</p>

<p>
He gulped, obviously feeling very uncomfortable at having every eye in
the room pinned on him.  Gamely, he gathered himself up and started
sketching numbers on his scroll before turning it to show me.  "If it
worked the way you suspect, M'Lord, and we set out to maximize the
bonus, and therefore production capacity, of your tower it would have
ten levels, each six feet high.  Give each bard nine square feet,
leave aisles three feet wide between rows so they can get to their
chairs, leave out space for the crafter and his equipment, and you
could pack in just under 18,000 bards, for a total bonus of about
+36,000.  Simplifying the math a bit and assuming the craftsman takes
the voluntary DC increase of 10 to his check, this would let you make
a suit of chainmail in about 12 minutes, which is astounding.  But,
M'Lord, people with class levels are rare&mdash;there probably aren't
18,000 third level bards in the nation, and certainly not the several
dozen times more that would be needed to set up all the facilities you
describe."
</p>

<p>
He paused, gulped again, and then gamely continued.  "Also, bard song
gives a +2 competence bonus, M'Lord.  And competence bonuses don't
stack.  No matter how many bards were singing, the crafter would still
only get +2."
</p>

<p>
I just stared at him, gobsmacked, as all my plans for equipping the army went
up in smoke.
</p>

<p>
How the hell did these people fight wars?  They couldn't make enough stuff to
outfit an army!
</p>

<p>
"How the hell do you people fight wars?  You can't make enough stuff to outfit
an army!" I yelped to Thomas.
</p>

<p>
He looked completely baffled again&mdash;as usual.  I was getting tired of that
look; it meant I had tripped over some weird quirk of the so-called "physics"
of this universe.
</p>

<p>
"We simply buy the equipment in the market," he said, in much the same tone
that one might say "This is water.  It's wet."
</p>

<p>
I gobbled.  "But, you can't&mdash;not enough production&mdash;economics
don't&mdash;supply and demand&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"M'Lord," he said, using the more formal title here in public. "I assure you,
we simply buy it in the marketplace.  Of course, some places don't have
particular goods for sale, which I've always found odd, but if it's there, you
can buy what you need."
</p>

<p>
I wasn't willing to concede the point yet.  "But dumping all that money into an
economy would cause inflation and drive prices up!  And any merchant must have
a finite stock!"
</p>

<p>
"How does spending money relate to adding air to a bladder, or to changing
prices, M'Lord?  Merchants well...respectfully Lord, if they have a particular
item then you can buy as much as you need.  Isn't that how it works in your
dimension?"
</p>

<p>
Aside from Thomas, who was his usual stoic self, and Reynard, who was obviously
snickering in his beard, everyone in the room was staring at me uncomfortably
as if I were a crazy person who might or might not be dangerous.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I just picked up my jaw and forced my brain back into gear.
</p>

<p>
"Fine," I said tiredly.  "It's utterly insane and whoever designed this
economic system should be shot, but whatever.  I assume that selling works the
same way&mdash;I can sell as much as I want of whatever I want, all without
affecting prices?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course, M'Lord," Thomas said with a carefully neutral tone.
</p>

<p>
"Fine," I said again.  "What's iron worth?"  One of the scribes timidly
answered "One silver piece per pound, M'Lord."
</p>

<p>
"Lovely.  Reynard, when you cast Wall of Iron, how much iron do you get?"
</p>

<p>
"One 5'x5' square per level, each one inch thick per four levels.  My casting
gets 18 squares, each four inches thick," he answered immediately.  "Which
works out to 73,650 pounds of iron&mdash;I've done the math before, Lord.  Oh,
and it costs 50 gold pieces to cast."  He was outright grinning now, obviously
knowing where I was going.
</p>

<p>
"Lovely.  That's roughly seven thousand gold pieces of economically insane
profit for every Wall.  Lower level magi make less profit but who cares.  Get
every mage who can cast it cranking right now, then get the iron to the market,
sell it, and start buying gear.  I want half again as many sets of equipment as
we've got soldiers, so about 30,000 sets total.  Each set should include
breastplate, buckler, bastard sword, dagger, heavy crossbow, 120 bolts, plus
sundries; clothes, tent, that sort of thing.  Talk to one of the sergeants in
the Landguard, get whatever he recommends.  You, you, and you&mdash;go."  Three
of the couriers sprinted off.
</p>

<p>
I shook my head at the utter insanity of it.  Then I moved on.
</p>

<p>
"How many people in Flobovia?" I asked the scribe who had spoken up before.
</p>

<p>
"A bit over twenty-eight million as of the last census, M'Lord," he came back
promptly.
</p>

<p>
I blinked.  I'd been expecting a much lower number; clearly, Flobovia was doing
something right when it came to food production, since I recalled that in D&D a
person required "about a pound of food a day."
</p>

<p>
"How do you grow enough food for...you know what, never mind.  I'm sure you
just buy the damn food in the marketplace and it magically appears from some
damn place without a farmer ever being involved.  Probably brought there by
friggin' pixies riding on rainbow unicorns."
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, My Lord.  It's brought by elves on griffonback.  Much higher cargo
capacity than pixies." said Thomas, totally deadpan.
</p>

<p>
I eyed him narrowly.  "Did you just make a joke?"
</p>

<p>
His eyes twinkled and his mouth twitched just a little.  "My Lord!  I'm
shocked.  Everyone knows that paladins are a sober and serious folk."
</p>

<p>
I tried to glare at him, I really did.  But I finally broke down and snorted
instead.  Reynard, who had done an admirable job of staying straight-faced
throughout, nearly busted a gut.  When he had it under control again he leaned
over to me and stage-whispered "The Commander's deepest secret is that he
actually has a sense of humor.  Now that you know, feel free to blackmail him!"
</p>

<p>
I stuck my tongue out at him, then went back to what I'd been thinking about.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, we're going to set up a commoner railgun.  Get a bunch of normal
people&mdash;no one with class levels, just beggars, homeless, drifters,
laborers; anyone with no strong ties who wants to earn some silver. Tell them
we'll pay two silver a day.  String a line of them, each five feet apart, from
here to the nearest point on the Fens, then turn east and run the line along
the Fens to the point where the Deorsi are most likely to cross the Maligaw.
As the gear comes available, have them pass it down the line.  The first person
in the line picks up an item as a move action, drops it into the hands of the
next person as a free action.  Repeat all the way down the chain, and within
one round the item is a few hundred miles away at the head of the line."
</p>

<p>
Reynard was positively gleeful.  "Non-magical teleportation, who would have
thought of it?"
</p>

<p>
I shrugged.  "Not my idea.  I read it on a website.  An average person weighs
under two hundred pounds, and someone with an average strength can lift two
hundred pounds off the ground, so they can shuttle people as well as goods.
Also, get trackers into the Fens to find those magic-eating fenfrogs.  Cage
them, pass them down the line, and stockpile them at the head of the line. Get
some apprentice magi down there to keep them fed.  When the Deorsi get here,
we'll catapult the 'frogs cages into their ranks; if the cages are padded well
enough, some of the 'frogs will survive the landing and they'll eat the magic
out of all the armor, weapons, and spellcasters in their area."
</p>

<p>
Most of the people in the room looked impressed; Thomas, of course, was the
practical one.  "We'll need to feed all these people, and get tents over them
at night, of course.  And it's going to require a lot of money&mdash;you're
talking about hundreds of thousands of people at two silver a day.  That's
about a million gold every five days.  Even with your trick with the Wall of
Iron, I'm not sure we can afford that."
</p>

<p>
I shrugged again.  "Fine. Somebody get me a list of prices for market goods."
One of the scribes hastily shuffled through his stack of resource papers and
handed me five sheets of closely spaced print.  I studied it for a minute,
flipping through the various pages, then pointed at two entries.  "Here.
Quarterstaves are free, firewood is 1 copper.  It doesn't say how much firewood
you get for a copper, just "per day."  Well, I feel like only having a very
small fire for a very short time today, so chop the staves up into tiny little
pieces and sell each of them as a separate lot of firewood.  Voila, infinite
free money, and have I mentioned that your economy is broken?  Here's another:
a ten foot ladder is five copper; take it apart and you've got two ten foot
poles each of which is worth two silver, plus ten rungs which can be sold as
firewood for basically infinite money, because sanity is overrated! Oh, here's
a good one&mdash;musical instruments are five gold.  A woodblock is a musical
instrument and quarterstaves are still free."  I flipped a few more pages
before finding another.  "Based on weight, a mug of ale is a pint, and it costs
four copper.  There's eight pints in a gallon, or 3.2 silver, but a gallon of
ale only costs 2 silver.  Buy ale by the gallon, pour it into mugs, have over
50% profit.  Let's see, what else...oh, here we go.  A blank spellbook has 100
parchment pages and costs 15 gold.  Rip those pages out and suddenly they're
worth 20 gold for the parchment, and that's just stupid."
</p>

<p>
I grimaced in disgust.  "Once again, have I mentioned that this economy is
fundamentally insane?  Anyway, get somebody going on all those options; you're
right that we'll need the cash.  Take 20% of the profits, set up schools all
around the country, and hire scribes and scholars to teach.  Spread the word
that any literate commoner pays no taxes."
</p>

<p>
Eyes around the room got wide.  Thomas spoke, very evenly, "No taxes at all
M'Lord?  That will seriously weaken the royal purse.  And the nobles will
be...distressed, if they suddenly have no tax revenue."
</p>

<p>
I snorted.  "I just gave you five ways to make infinite money, after looking at
your price lists for two minutes.  I really don't think cutting taxes on the
poor is going to be a problem.  As to the nobles, give them all an annual grant
of twice what they were making from taxes and they'll shut up."
</p>

<p>
Before I could start thinking of anything else, there was a knock on the door.
One of the Landguard at the door opened it to admit a young pageboy right out
of a Dutch painting&mdash;about twelve, blond hair cut in a bowl job, tunic and
all.
</p>

<p>
"If it please you, M'Lord, the Conclave inquires if you would care to join them
for the afternoon meal?" he piped.
</p>

<p>
A quick flash of guilt, and not a little worry, hit me.  Yeah, it might have
been a good idea to schedule a meeting with my council of advisors who happened
to be some of the most influential people in the country.  I hoped that they
weren't too pissed at having been ignored until now.
</p>

<p>
"That sounds like an excellent idea.  I am quite hungry."  I rose and turned to
the scribes.  "Please make sure you have everything copied off the display, and
then take a break for the afternoon.  I suspect I'll be busy with the Conclave
for a while.  I'll call you when I want to start up again."
</p>

<p>
They bowed in acknowledgement and went back to hastily scribbling on their
scrolls.  I left the room, Thomas and Reynard flanking me and the six Landguard
bracketing us, three in front and three behind.
</p>

<p>
"Is this level of protection <em>really</em> necessary, Thomas?  We're
in the capital city, in the ruler's castle, surrounded by defenses and
guards.  The Deorsi are hundreds of miles away.  What's going to
suddenly leap around the corner and try to kill me, a ninja rat armed
with a splinter?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, not a rat, I think.  A chicken, perhaps.  Very dangerous creatures,
chickens," Thomas responded, completely straight-faced.  "In seriousness,
though; this protection is absolutely necessary, M'Lord.  We are at war; the
enemy would love nothing better than to assassinate you.  The Landguard is
sworn to keep the ruler alive, and in our eight hundred years of existence we
have never failed in that duty."
</p>

<p>
I shrugged, having already learned the futility of trying to get between Thomas
and his oath.  I had a feeling that this was also a subtle tweak for giving him
such a hard time about the small size of the protective detail I had insisted
on this morning.  Instead I turned to Reynard as we continued along the
corridor.
</p>

<p>
"Dedicated Wright&mdash;you can see through its eyes at any distance, right?
Can you read a scroll through them?"
</p>

<p>
He look startled.  "I'm...not sure.  It's not the sort of thing anyone normally
does with a creature that's sitting alone at home."
</p>

<p>
I grimaced; it would have been really convenient if he knew that offhand.
"Feh.  Ok, well, we'll find out.  Thomas, could you please use that nifty
gauntlet of yours to have someone go talk to one of those magi who has a
Dedicated Wright.  I want to know if it's possible to read a scroll through the
eyes of his Wright when he can't see the scroll himself."
</p>

<p>
Thomas nodded, stone-faced, and sent one of his smoke-sparrows off to try the
experiment.
</p>

<p>
As the thing left, we arrived at our destination; an open air atrium
inside the castle filled with elegant gardens and a marble terrace.
Waiting at a table spread with a linen tablecloth and laden down with
food were two empty chairs and six richly dressed men and women. All
six of them rose to their feet as we entered.  Looking at their faces,
I recognized Archmage Isaac; from his stiff expression, it was clear
that he was pissed.  The rest were completely unreadable, but none of
them were looking friendly.
</p>

<p>
Oy, this was not going to be a fun meeting.
</p>
