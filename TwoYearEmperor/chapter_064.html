<em><strong>Author's Note</strong>:  Still don't own D&D.</em>
</p>

<hr />

<p>
"Ah," I said faintly, panting a bit and favoring the stitch in my
side.  "So...is there any...chance that you could...get us an audience
with the Death God...do you think?"  I leaned on my knees to catch my
breath.
</p>

<p>
"Hell no," Loki said with amusement.  "No way am I getting between you
and the God of Death&mdash;or any of the other gods, for that matter.
A little advice now and then is one thing, but I am not putting my
keister on the line for you.  You want to talk to him, go find his pet
lich."  He glanced around with a hint of nervousness.  "In fact, I
don't even want to be anywhere near this conversation, since I don't
want Deathy McDeathPants to crush my head.  I'm gone, outta here,
sayonara, departing with haste, expeditiously retreating, and most
certainly taking my leave with greater celerity!  Adios!"  He snapped
his fingers and popped like a soap bubble.
</p>

<p>
I sighed, looking at the now empty hallway next to me.  After a
moment, when my breathing stabilized, I straightened up.  "Well, that
went well," I said ironically.
</p>

<p>
"He gave us the answer, though," Thomas said.  "We just need to find
Melvin.  And if we present the idea properly, we should be able to get
that information from Icefi."
</p>

<p>
I grimaced.  "Is it crazy of me to say that I'm actually more nervous
about going in front of Melvin than I am of going in front of His
Deathness?"
</p>

<p>
"Not really," Albrecht responded.  "From our point of view, their
power levels are much equivalent: 'greater than we can handle.'  The
difference is that Melvin is an experienced general with a great deal
of patience and subtlety.  From what we've seen so far, the Death God
approaches things with a sledgehammer&mdash;his primary tactic is to
flood the world with undead and he doesn't seem to vary from that
plan.  Also, it's pretty clear that he rushed Melvin into starting the
war before he was ready."
</p>

<p>
"Not surprising," Isaac commented with a sniff.  "The gods are too
used to their power; most of the time they simply have no need for
subtlety.  Loki appears to be a notable exception."  He paused, then
forced himself to add, "Although, the 'flood the world with undead'
tactic appears to work quite well.  No reason to change a winning
plan."
</p>

<p>
I grumbled a bit at that and then sighed.  "Ok, well, if we're going
to be dealing with Melvin&mdash;by the way, we really need to remember
not to call him that to his face&mdash;anyway, if we're going to be
dealing with him, we better make sure we have our ducks in a row.  Any
thoughts?"
</p>

<p>
Crickets chirped.  People stared in bafflement.  I sighed.
</p>

<p>
<em>~Translator magic <strong>still</strong> not handling
idioms,~</em> I thought in exasperation.  "We need to make sure we're
well prepared," I rephrased.  "We need to understand everything that's
going on and have contingency plans for everything that might go
wrong."
</p>

<p>
Comprehension dawned.
</p>

<p>
"Hard to do if we don't know the actual plan," Colborn put in
acerbically.  He had really not been happy when I refused to give up
those details.
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.  "Nope, still not sharing.  Can't take a chance that
we're being spied on despite moving around the Holes.  I don't even
trust our mindlink to be completely spy-proof, despite what Loki said.
Don't worry, I'll tell you at the last minute. I promise; if we can
get Neklos to actually talk to us, I'm pretty sure I can convince him
to leave us alone.  And if he's not pushing Afi&mdash;er,
Melvin&mdash;then this whole war should just...stop."
</p>

<p>
No one looked happy at that, and Albrecht may or may not have mumbled
something scatological under his breath.  They didn't have much choice
except to take it, though.  I was the only one who had even a vague
plan.
</p>

<p>
"One thing I noticed," Reynard said thoughtfully.  "Loki seems to like
to drop information subtly, not saying it directly.  Probably part of
that is that he's the god of deception and simply being
straightforward is against his nature.  It might also be that it gives
him plausible deniability with the other gods, if they ever objected
to something he told us."
</p>

<p>
A round of nods went around the group.  "And?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Think about how he said goodbye," Reynard said.  "Notice a pattern?"
</p>

<p>
Unn pursed her lips thoughtfully.  "Haste, Expeditious Retreat,
Celerity&mdash;all spell names, all pertaining to speed."
</p>

<p>
"And he had just finished talking about the Death God killing him,
which makes me think that perhaps there was a link.  Perhaps these are
combat tactics that the Death God would use," Albrecht said slowly.
"Gods typically have character levels, many of them caster levels, so
they can cast spells just like any of us can.  And even if they don't,
they can reproduce spells through their divine power.  I see no reason
why the Death God would need to use Expeditious Retreat, but the other
two...those I could see."
</p>

<p>
I flipped open the Brainopedia and shuffled through to Haste.  Hm.
Nothing terribly interesting there...extra movement speed, one extra
attack, some minor bonuses.  If it ever got to the point where we were
having to run away from Neklos or physically attack him, we were
already thoroughly stuffed.  Moving on, I went and looked at Celerity.
</p>

<p>
"Oh dear," I said in dismay.  "Celerity means you go first.  Always.
If Death can cast that freely, then that pretty much puts the kibosh
on how I was thinking of dealing with him."
</p>

<p>
Thomas shook his head.  "No, not quite.  If you cast it then yes, you
can preempt whatever's happening around you&mdash;for example, an
attack.  But it's an immediate action to cast it, and you only get one
of those per round.  You can use an immediate action when it's not
your turn, but only one.  The answer to dealing with them is to have
multiple attackers.  The first of them attacks, the target preempts
using Celerity.  The second attacker casts Celerity himself, thereby
preempting the target's casting of Celerity.  The second attacker is
then free to act before the target can.  And the target can't cast it
again, because he's already used his one immediate action."
</p>

<p>
I blinked, staring at Thomas open-mouthed for a moment while I sorted
out that tangled mess of a statement.  Everyone else was doing pretty
much the same thing.
</p>

<p>
Seeing our flummoxed-edness, Thomas shrugged.  "What?  It's a standard
combat tactic that any bodyguard has to be ready for."
</p>

<p>
"...Right," I said.  "Ok, the party is back on, I guess.  We just have
to get with Af&mdash;with Melvin, and then arrange for Death to show
up.  So, who wants to talk to Icefi and set us up a date with his
boss?"
</p>


<p>
Thomas snorted.  "I'll do it.  He and I have developed a certain level
of understanding after the last time."  There were a round of amused
chuckles at that.
</p>

<p>
"Make sure that we're talking with the real one," I told him.  "The
one with the shard of Death in him.  Tell him we know how to get the
shard out."
</p>

<p>
Thomas nodded acknowledgement before turning his attention to the
Telepathic Bond between all of us and Icefi.
</p>

<p>
<em>*Monster,*</em> he sent.  <em>*We know how to get the shard out of
your creator.  Arrange for us to meet him and we'll remove it for
him.*</em>
</p>

<p>
The voice that came back was just as cold as before.  <em>*This is a
trick.  You simply wish to assassinate my creator.*</em>
</p>

<p>
Thomas glanced at me, head cocked in question.
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.  "I swear we won't do anything to A&mdash;to Melvin
himself.  We'll explain how to get the shard out and let him do it
himself.  We only need to talk to him because we want to have a
meeting with Death."
</p>

<p>
<em>*We will not harm your progenitor,*</em> Thomas sent.  <em>*We
simply need to talk to Death through him.*</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>*If you wish to speak to Death, you only need to call his name
until he notices you.  There is no reason you need to do it through
the person of my creator.  In fact, your plan carries risk to the
Creator&mdash;any time the Death God manifests through him, there is a
chance that He will not depart afterwards, that He will simply subsume
the Creator entirely.  I see no reason to help you.*</em>
</p>

<p>
Thomas glanced at me with an 'are you really sure about this?'  look,
and I nodded firmly.  <em>*Unless you arrange the meeting, we will not
tell you how to remove the shard,*</em> Thomas sent, overtones of
determination accompanying the telepathic words.  <em>*During the
meeting, I will follow the rules of parley as long as you, your
creator, and any over whom have you influence keep faith with us and
do not attack.  Under parley, I will not harm your creator and will
protect him from harm from my companions or from any other source.
Should any of my companions, even my Emperor, actively seek to harm
your creator, I will strike them down.  I swear on the Land, and in
the name of the True God of Flobovia, to keep my faith with
thee,*</em> Thomas finished.  <em>*I bind my honor and my soul in
earnest to this vow: my word is good, my intent is without deceit, I
shall not waver from its completion.*</em>
</p>

<p>
There was silence on the line for long seconds.  <em>*Very well,*</em>
the answer finally came.  <em>*I will arrange it.  Once a week, an
hour before dawn in our current location's time, my creator holds
audience for envoys from other polities.  I will arrange for you to be
on the schedule for the next one, two days from now.  Is this
acceptable?*</em>
</p>

<p>
Thomas glanced at me for confirmation, then sent <em>*Indeed.  And
thank you.*</em>
</p>

<p>
There was a dry, bony, disgruntled sniff over the bond and then
silence as Icefi withdrew from our mental presence.
</p>

<p>
I let out a breath I hadn't realized I'd been holding.  "Well, that
went well."  I smiled.  "And this time I mean it without the sarcasm."
</p>

<p>
Thomas gave me a hairy eyeball.  "I hope you truly meant it about not
harming him.  I am bound to keep my vow, and I swore in the name of
the Land.  It will take precendence over my duty to you."
</p>

<p>
I forced my face into its best 'sincere' expression.  "I meant it.  We
won't harm Afi at all."
</p>

<p>
He nodded, apparently satisfied.  "Very well.  It's getting late; I
would suggest some dinner, finish whatever preparations are required,
then bed.  We'll want an early start tomorrow; there's a lot to do
before the meeting with Melvin day after tomorrow."
</p>

<p>
"Seems sensible," I said, starting to turn towards the shop where we
could get some meals.  I was interrupted by a tug on my arm.
Surprised, I turned to face Suze.
</p>

<p>
"M'Lord," she said, bashful but determined.  "If you don't need me for
a time, would it be alright if I went to speak with some of the magi?
I was thinking about what Archmage Isaac said&mdash;" she nodded to
the worthy in question &mdash;"about how I needed to keep my notes
secret. I'd like to have someone Wish a magic item for me, a pen that
takes notes in invisible ink."
</p>

<p>
My eyebrows went up at that; it was clever.  "Sure, that sounds great.
In fact, here, give me something to write on."  I took the pen and
paper from her and scribbled on the top sheet: 'Give Suze whatever
magic items she wants, even if you have to Wish them up --Emperor
Jacob' and passed it to her.  "That should keep anyone from giving you
static about interrupting them, or forcing them to spend experience."
</p>

<p>
She graced me with that shy, happy smile that I loved so much.  "Thank
you, M'Lord," she said, ducking her head.  Turning, she trotted off,
the note held tightly in her hand like a talisman.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht watched her go with a fond smile, then turned to me.  "Dinner
sounds like a good plan.  Afterwards, I should go through the FLEA so
that I can actually be a wizard."
</p>

<p>
I blinked.  "But...you are a wizard."
</p>

<p>
He shook his head with a grin like an eight year old who just
successfully raided the cookie jar.  "No, I'm not.  Oh, I've
cultivated a reputation for it, but actually I'm a sixteenth level
Noble."
</p>

<p>
"But...when you first came to Capital City you cast Wish&mdash;" I
began, before realizing that no, he hadn't.  He'd had a Teleportation
Circle set up, and he'd had everyone step back into it as he pretended
to cast Wish.  "And you cast Sending when we first broke into the
mountain..." I tried.
</p>

<p>
He held up his right hand, pointing to the elegant silver ring on the
third finger.  "Ring of Sending, much like the bracers your Landguard
use.  Very useful for coordinating armies."
</p>

<p>
I gaped at him, then laughed ruefully.  "Fine.  Sounds good.  Any
other little surprises you've been keeping from us that we should know
about?"
</p>

<p>
He pretended the think for a moment, staring at the ceiling with one
finger rubbing his chin.  "Hmm...no, I don't think so.  No secrets
left that you should know about."
</p>

<p>
I gave him a disgusted look at that obviously weaselly answer, but let
it go.  "Fine, we'll get you all FLEA'd up.  Everyone grab one of the
Fortifying Bedrolls so that we only have to sleep an hour.  Albrecht,
Thomas, Unn, Drifa, don't forget your various jobs.  Everyone will
need to memorize spells, too.  Oh, and if you haven't been POPE'd yet,
go do that." I turned to my chief bodyguard. "Thomas, you sure you
won't let me go do that now?  Wouldn't it be a good idea for me to be
amped up before we go beard the Death lion in his den?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas shook his head firmly.  "Absolutely not.  This is the worst
time to do something that could risk destabilizing you; the
intelligence enhancement when we gave you the Headband was problematic
enough.  The rest of us are along to advise; we'll cover anything you
miss.  When we get back from the meeting with Melvin, we'll run you
through the enhancers."
</p>

<p>
I grimaced, but had to acknowledge that he had a point.
</p>

<p>
"I think we should let him do it, Commander," Reynard said, giving
Thomas a speaking look that I didn't fully understand but was all in
favor of as it seemed likely to get me what I wanted.  "He's right;
we'll need all the edge we can get before doing this, and that
includes getting all of us enhanced. Don't worry, I'm confident it
won't be an issue&mdash;when Isaac and I Wished up the POPEs, we made
it so that the enhancement doesn't have directly perceptible effects.
That way the newly enhanced person isn't rattled by the change."
</p>

<p>
Thomas hesitated, studying Reynard for a moment, then shrugged.  "Very
well.  Lead on."
</p>

<p>
Reynard raised an eyebrow sardonically.  "Lo, the miracle I have
wrought: the Commander of the Landguard being convinced to change his
mind!  Prestidigitation!"  Tiny fireworks popped in the air around us,
and a cheap paper banner with giant red block letters saying "Master
Persuader: Archmage Reynard Aguillard!" appeared in Reynard's hands.
</p>

<p>
I laughed.  "Have you been hanging out with Loki, Reynard?  The
goofiness is really more his style."
</p>

<p>
He shrugged eloquently.  "What can I say?  He's inspiring."
</p>

<p>
I gave him a smile and we turned for the door.  
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
I stared at the line of POPEs like a hungry dog staring at a steak.  I
was already smarter than Stephen Hawking.  Now I was about to be more
charismatic that JFK and wiser than the Dalai Lama.  I was <em>so</em>
looking forward to this.
</p>

<p>
"After you, Your Majesty," Reynard said with a grand wave of his hand
at the POPEs.
</p>

<p>
I marched forward, stopping on the target drawn in front of the
Strength POPE.  It was a little disappointing: there was no change in
my body, my muscles didn't actually swell like the Hulk's, I didn't
promptly drop to 4% body fat and have rock-hard chiseled abs.  I
didn't even feel a surge of mystical energy flooding through me,
bearing with it the mighty power of Atlas. (Charles or Greek, take
your pick.)  Still, this was why there was a granite boulder the size
of a medicine ball sitting on the ground in front of the target,
specifically so that people could test their newfound might.  I
hoisted it into the air with a grunt and a delighted smile; the thing
weighed easily twice what I did, and before the enhancement I couldn't
even do a chin up.
</p>

<p>
I dropped it and, with a faint <em>tra-la-la</em>, skipped off to the
next POPE.  It was the Intelligence one and wouldn't have any effect
on me, but I wasn't about to let the others know that.  So far, the
fact that I had Wished myself smarter was still a secret; this way I
wouldn't need to worry about anyone noticing my enhancement any more.
They would just assume that it had happened now instead of back in
Ilara's temple.
</p>

<p>
<em>~Good thing there's no visual on the enhancements,~</em> I
thought.  <em>~It would totally give the game away.~</em>
</p>

<p>
I paused in front of the Intelligence POPE long enough that it would
have worked, then skipped off to the Wisdom enhancer.  A moment in
front of it so that it could pump up my common-sense-itude and I moved
on to Dexterity.
</p>

<p>
There was still no feeling of enhancement, but Dexterity was at least
something that could be tested.  Reynard took advantage of the fact
that his earlier Prestidigitation was still running; with a wave of
his hand, he tossed me five small rocks.  "Juggle them," he suggested.
Isaac shot him a sour glance&mdash;maybe he was upset at Reynard for
using his Prestidigitation to basically show off?  Whatever, I ignored
him.
</p>

<p>
At one point I actually had learned to juggle&mdash;I'd been into all
sorts of strange hobbies back in high school&mdash;but I hadn't done
it in decades and I'd never been able to do more than three balls.
Despite that, when I tossed the rocks up, my hands moved in a
smooth, effortlessly coordinated blur.  All five rocks flowed in a
steady waterfall, perfectly in front of me, without strain and without
so much as a single bobble.  I kept it going for a moment, tossed one
extra high so that I could pirouette and catch it on the way down,
then left the rocks fall and skipped on to Constitution.
</p>

<p>
There was no easy way to test either the Constitution or Charisma
enhancements, but I came out of the whole experience smiling and
bouncy.  The others followed me through in a neat line&mdash;Thomas,
Alpha Squad, Albrecht, Unn, Drifa, Isaac, Reynard&mdash;and then
Albrecht peeled off to head for the FLEA, saying that he'd meet us at
dinner when he was done.
</p>

<p>
With a song in my heart and a spring in my step, I turned back to
Gr&#491;fhamr and a hearty meal.  Things were looking up&mdash;I was
strong, wise, hardy, and in two days time we were going to kick Neklos
to the curb and get this whole damn war over with!
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
The sudden flood of new magi had made Gr&#491;fhamr's crowding a thing
of the past.  Instead of being jammed into Rope Tricks and sleeping
standing up, everyone was now ensconced in palatial Mage's Magnificent
Mansions, being waited on hand and foot by magical servants as they
dined on the finest foie gras, candied persimmons, honey-glazed dragon
steak, and other rare and tasty viands.
</p>

<p>
I had tried reclining, Roman style, on a burgundy leather chaise
longue while eating peeled grapes.  I rapidly learned two things:
eating while reclining is hell on your back, and peeled grapes are
disgusting.  I got myself a decent chair, garlic mashed potatoes with
plenty of butter, a small spinach salad, and a two-inch-thick
tenderloin steak that had at some point been waved vaguely near a fire
but not actually over it before being covered in a crust of baked blue
cheese.
</p>

<p>
I'm pretty sure there was conversation going on around me, but I
didn't hear any of it: I was far too busy wallowing shamelessly in 
gustatory bliss.
</p>

<p>
Eventually I sat back, replete with deliciousness, and took a sip of
an excellent (and, thankfully, entirely nonalcoholic!) red
wine&mdash;rather more Malbec than Pinot, although of course neither
Argentina nor Burgundy existed in this world.  Personally, I was just
glad that the magic of the Mansion could make something
that <em>tasted</em> like wine, but didn't trigger Icefi's
Mindscraped-in booze aversion.
</p>

<p>
Tuning in to my surroundings again, I saw that everyone else was
finished, picking idly at the array of delicious deserts that covered
the center of the table, but mostly just enjoying the food coma.  Suze
looked particularly happy, although she still sat slightly curled in
on herself as she tried to be invisible.  Her 'imperial adviser and
executive assistant' persona was starting to displace her
'chambermaid' persona, but there was clearly a ways to go.  In
particular, I was pretty sure that the upstairs chambermaids were
never invited to dine with the ruler and his closest advisors.
Especially not in the seat of honor to my right.
</p>

<p>
Personally, I thought it was just a sensible place to put her.  If I
needed pen, paper, maps, books, the name of some person we needed, or
anything else, it was easier to have them passed to my dominant right
hand.  At this point, I was pretty confident that even if I asked for
a rubber chicken with green feathers, Suze would have anticipated the
request and have it in one of her many magical belt pouches.  I
grinned, idly considering testing the theory, but decided it was too
ridiculous.
</p>

<p>
"Did you get your new pen, Suze?" I asked quietly, not wanting to
disturb the other diners.
</p>

<p>
She started slightly at the question, then ducked her head and smiled.
"Yes, M'Lord.  Also, I had them make these."  She passed me a pouch
full of small marbles made of some iridescent metal.  "They're
teleport marbles, M'Lord.  They're all linked.  If any one of them is
dropped, everyone within a hundred yards who is touching one will be
teleported back to the place the marbles were first created.  Also,
immediately before the teleport effect activates, each marble will
emit a powerful Dispel Magic aimed at any Dimensional Lock in the area
that might prevent the teleport."
</p>

<p>
I blinked.  "Suze...this is brilliant.  How did you think of it?"
</p>

<p>
She blushed furiously, but her smile got a bit wider.  "Thank you,
M'Lord.  It...just seemed logical?  If we're all going to face the
Death God, we'll want some way to escape quickly if we need to.
Dropping an object is a free action, so it can be done even if you've
already acted that round."
</p>

<p>
"Huh," I said.  "But...activating a magic item is a standard action.
Doesn't that mean that you can't do it after you act?"
</p>

<p>
She hunched in on herself, clearly uncomfortable at disagreeing with
me.  "Well, most items do, M'Lord, but there are exceptions.  Shrunk
Items convert back to normal if you throw them down, and that's not
activating a magic item.  Portable Holes activate as soon as they're
spread out; all you have to do is drop them.  I just had them phrase
the Wish so that it would work."
</p>

<p>
"Huh," I said again, but I was smiling fit to split my face.  "That's
brilliant.  Thank you, this might make a lot of difference."  I
paused, thinking back to something she'd said a moment ago.  "Also,
what you mean 'we', kemo sabe?  No way you're going with us to face
the Death God."
</p>

<p>
She got a mulish look on her face and started to say something, then
paused.  Her expression relaxed into a calm smile and she nodded
politely.  "As you say, M'Lord.  I understand the danger."
</p>

<p>
I gave her a squinty look for a moment but eventually I sighed and
rapped the table for attention.  "Ok, everybody.  Where do we stand?"
There was a faint chorus of sighs around the table as the others were
pulled away from their food, but everyone got their game face on.
</p>

<p>
"I recruited ten of the new magi as my direct reports and had them
start organizing the rest," Unn said.  "We're setting them up on
military lines, since it's a familiar framework and we expect there's
going to be a lot of fighting before things are over.  The new magi
are being divided into regiments, battalions, companies, platoons,
squads, and teams.  New magi are coming out of the FLEAs so quickly
that it's hard to keep up and get them organized promptly, but we're
making progress.  As we recruit more people it will get easier."  She
paused, then offered a warning.  "They aren't experienced soldiers,
though.  They're refugees, and most of them were Union nobles before
the War started.  They don't have any experience of combat, or even of
real organization before this.  It simply wasn't necessary
Before&mdash;people mostly did what they wanted.  There was
socializing, but not very many cohesive, organized groups."
</p>

<p>
I frowned at that.  "Didn't you tell me about warbands and thieves who
all got the same face?" I asked Albrecht.  "Those sound like
'cohesive, organized groups' to me.  And you were High Marshal of an
army.  That's definitely an organized group."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht shrugged.  "The military was organized, yes, but we were a
tiny fraction of the population.  The independent warbands were mostly
from outside polities, come to Anundj&aring; to make their fortunes.
Most of the people who survived to reach Gr&#491;fhamr were either
nobles or soldiers, but the soldiers took the brunt of the casualties
on the way in.  The nobles...well, 'noble' means something different
for us.  In Flobovia, a noble is a person who rules over others.  For
us, a noble is someone with enough caster levels, or enough marks,
that they can trivially satisfy their needs."
</p>

<p>
"Marks?" I asked, puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"Our equivalent of money," he said.  "Like I said before, what
Flobovia would consider normal money&mdash;gold, jewels,
whatever&mdash;doesn't really matter in a modern economy.  When we
were talking about the value of magic items, I said 'gold pieces'
because that's what you all are familiar with, but our economy ran on
marks.  Marks are coins, like your gold pieces, but their value
doesn't rest on the scarcity of a metal&mdash;we could conjure as much
gold as we wanted.  Marks represent unique things&mdash;favors, access
to services, entrance to artistic performances, and so on.  A master
musician could perform once a year and make enough marks that he
didn't need to work for the rest of the year.  Since we had centuries
to build our skills, most people were masters of something and didn't
need to work.  As such, there wasn't really any need for hierarchical
organizations like guilds or academies, so our nobles have little to
no experience working under someone else's direction."
</p>

<p>
Thomas frowned.  "They'd better <em>get</em> some damn experience,
fast.  We can't afford to have people running in all directions and
failing to do what needs to be done."  He pondered a moment, then
nodded decisively.  "In fact, yes.  I think I can address this problem
quite nicely.  I have several Sergeants running around right now;
tomorrow, I can have several hundred copies of them.  We'll put them
in charge of getting the new troops kicked into shape."
</p>

<p>
I grinned.  "Make them all copies of Sergeant Duncan.  If anyone can
do the kicking, it's him."
</p>

<p>
Thomas frowned.  "Duncan has only been on punishment duty for a day.
I'm not willing to trust him yet, and <em>certainly</em> not willing
to trust Ice Assassins of him."
</p>

<p>
I leaned over and laid a hand gently on his mail-clad arm.  "Let it
go, Thomas," I told him kindly.  "I won't make this an order, but you
really shouldn't be too angry with Duncan.  He got conned by a
millenia-old lich who is probably one of the strongest Diplomancers on
the planet.  Basically, Duncan crit-failed his save.  It happens."
</p>

<p>
If Suze had looked a bit mulish a moment ago, Thomas was an entire
barren of mules.  I'll give him credit though: he really did think
about it.  It took a minute or so, but I watched as he shifted from
'no way in all the layers of every Hell ever imagined' to 'vehemently
opposed' to 'do not want!!!' to 'grumbling acquiescence.'
</p>

<p>
"Fine," he grumbled.  "I'll get a bunch of Ice Assassin of him made
up, and then change his punishment duty to training the newbies.
Dealing with a new intake is bad enough, and training conscripts for
town militia is a damn nightmare.  Training a bunch of perfumed
princes to be obedient soldiers should be aggravating enough to make
the point, but still useful.  And it'll keep him out of my hair."  A
thought struck him and he grinned a truly evil grin.  "Also, I'll make
him and all his copies bunk together.  He snores like a damn ripsaw."
</p>

<p>
I smiled and leaned back, the point made.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, on to other business," I said, turning back to the table at
large.  "I was thinking about this."  I pulled a brass key out of my
pocket, turning it from side to side so it caught the light.  "Loki
gave me an absolutely enormous room, covered in antimagic and filled
with tens of thousands, if not millions, of books containing secret
knowledge.  Furthermore, the door to the room is always right next to
me, and it disappears from existence when I lock it.  It occurs to me
that it would be nice to be able to smuggle a large group of
reinforcements into this audience with Melvin, and that we have a
ritual where we badly need to be able to catch up to the bad guys on
the number of things we've sacrificed.  This seems very much like a
'one stone two birds' sort of situation.  I'm thinking we set up a
railgun to throw all those books into the ritual fires, then
disassemble the shelves and use it as a staging ground.  What do the
rest of you say?"

<em><strong>Author's commentary:</strong> Collective nouns are fun.
It's a herd of horses, an exaltation of larks, a leap of
leopards, a crash of rhinos...and a barren of mules.  Cool.</em>

<em>The blurb for "One Hot Night" is:</em>
</p>
<p>
"In a society without death, Ingfred is 20 years old and has no
prospects. All the good jobs are filled by undying masters of their
craft, and it's hard to be taken seriously when you are, compared to
everyone around you, an infant.  Fortunately, he has a solution:
undergo an illegal transformation and sell the memory to The
Experiental Herald for a ridiculous sum.
</p>

<p>
There's two problems: how can Ingfred convince a powerful wizard to
risk his mage license and his freedom to help with such a crazy plan?
And, once that's done...how will Ingfred deal with the law?"
</p>
