<p>Twenty minutes later the Landguard and I were in my bedchamber; I
wasn't prepared to go back to the War Room yet. I was still too angry
and needed some time to cool down. Instead, I was sitting by the fire,
breathing deep calming breaths while staring at Allison in the
fireplace. The room was silent; even Allison wasn't prepared to
potentially set me off right now. The Landguard waited patiently; Suze
sat in a chair behind me, shoulders hunched and looking less
comfortable than a Fundamentalist in a gay bar.</p>

<p>"Thomas, you remember saying that the Deorsi were likely to try to
assassinate me?" The words could have sounded like idle musing, if you
were deaf and stupid.</p>

<p>"Yes, My Lord." Thomas replied stone-faced, offering nothing more
than the necessary minimum.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it's just as likely that they'll attempt to
assassinate other major leaders, or their families? I think we've been
remiss in not protecting those who matter most in Flobovia, don't
you?" There was a nasty smile lurking somewhere behind my words,
although their surface projected innocence&mdash;completely and
deliberately unconvincing innocence.</p>

<p>"...Yes, My Lord?" he said uncertainly. He clearly didn't know
where I was going with this and he clearly didn't like it.</p>

<p>"So glad you agree. Yes, we definitely need to do something about
that right away. Pass the order to the army; I want all the parents,
spouses and children of the Conclave members, <em>especially</em>
those of the Archpriest, brought here and given apartments in the
castle. They are not to leave the castle for any reason, and are to be
escorted by a trustworthy military bodyguard any time they leave their
rooms. I want it done by tonight."</p>

<p>"Are you sure that's wise, My Lord? It could&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop talking. Get it done."</p>

<p>As much of a hardcase as he was, Thomas winced at that. "Yes, My
Lord." There was a pause. "What should we do about Lady Shadow? No one
knows who she is, let alone who her family is."</p>

<p>I sighed, suddenly tired. "Let it ride. If she raises trouble we'll
go after her then."</p>

<p>"And what about Archmage Isaac? He isn't married and doesn't have
any children. His parents have been dead for decades."</p>

<p>I sighed again, rubbing my eyes. "Look, just do the best you can,
all right?"</p>

<p>Thomas nodded to Franklin; the young man saluted and left, looking
grateful to get away.</p>

<p>Silence fell again. The last of the rage leached out of me, leaving
only emptiness, exhaustion, and not a little despair. The whole
morning had been one brutal shock after another&mdash;the incredible power
that Albrecht had revealed Anundj&aring; to possess, the power he
revealed
<em>himself</em> to possess by Wishing himself and his compatriots
away, the idea of five thousand troops being resurrected in two
days...it was just too much. I was no longer thinking I was doomed; I
was sure of it.</p>

<p>I slumped bonelessly in my chair with a sigh, my hands folded
loosely on my belly as I pondered my onrushing doom. With gloomy
precision, I tried to calculate my most likely fate. Would the Deorsi
kill me, would they enslave me, or would I be eaten by rampaging
hordes of undead monsters? For a moment, I felt an instinctive desire
to ask for advice from...someone...but then Albrecht's example of a
wight in a fishing village floated through my mind. I could see it so
vividly; the twisted monster shambling through the foggy streets past
the ramshackle houses. Perhaps it would come out of the water, climb
up one of the docks, and lurch into town along the dirt road the
fishermen used to transport their catch. It would find its first
victim&mdash;perhaps a young man, on his way to tap at his
girlfriend's window while her parents were asleep. It would catch him,
club him to the ground with one warped limb and then pound him and
pound him with its lifestealing fists until, battered and bruised, his
life drained away. Moments later, his body would twist itself into a
parody of its slayer and he would arise...perhaps unsteady, the
monster inside taking a moment to learn which strings to pull to make
its new meatpuppet move properly. It would turn to its creator; they
would smile horrible, shark-toothed grins and then split up, each
seeking new lives to tear away, spreading their evil and malice
without bound, to the end of the earth, grinding all hope to dust,
bringing despair to....</p>

<p>Olivia reached over with one chainmail-clad hand and tapped me on
the arm.</p>

<p>Courage and hope blasted through me like a monsoon. The fear and
despair were ripped to shreds and scattered to the winds. The wights
in my mental image rounded a corner to find themselves face to face
with the entire village. Common men and women, armed with fishing
nets, gaffs, boathooks, knives, torches...whatever came to
hand. Facing the monsters with the steely determination of men and
women who made their living pulling heavy, dangerous, fish out of a
freezing ocean. Storms, reefs, sandbars, infected cuts, salt spray
constantly in the eyes&mdash;it was a hard life, and these people
lived it every day with uncomplaining, enduring strength. A mere pair
of undead was as nothing to them; within seconds the creatures were
caught, netted like tuna. Moments later, they were beaten to death and
then gutted just to be sure. Once it was done, everyone turned and
went back to the bar to finish their drinks, calmly discussing
tomorrow's weather and how it would affect the fishing.</p>

<p>I laughed, sitting up and looking around with a grin. "Whoooeee!
Thanks, Olivia! I have no idea what that was, but it was
<em>awesome!</em> Oh yeah, we are <em>so</em> gonna do this! A hundred
thousand Deorsi? Pshah!" A dismissive snap. "Constant resurrections?
That all they got?" A magnificent sneer. "They are so very done!" My
voice shifted into a bad imitation of Jack Nicholson. "Wait'll they
get a load of <em>me!</em>"</p>

<p>Olivia leaned back, looking just slightly alarmed. The others sat
stiffly, not wanting to draw the attention of the crazy person.</p>

<p>I looked around, grinning like a madman. "Siddown, alla yas. We
gots some plannin' to do, oh yes we does." I snickered at my own
silliness; right now, everything was amusing and nothing seemed
impossible. Go to the moon? Sure, why not?!  A few quick spells, we'd
be there in a jiff! Wipe out a massively overpowered enemy army? Psah,
keep lunch warm, I'll be right back!</p>

<p>Slowly, they took seats, Thomas settling in the chair opposite
me. Ryan pulled up the chair from the desk while his twin brother
James took a seat on the floor with the others. I eyed Ryan's chair
with concern for a moment; Ryan and James were two of the largest
and&mdash;although I would never say it out loud&mdash;ugliest men I'd
ever seen. They looked like well-groomed trolls and were festooned
with more weapons than any of the other Guardsmen. Seeing all the
people on the floor I frowned. "Have someone bring in more
chairs. Y'all shouldn't have to sit on the floor." An Earthling would
probably have asked me why I was saying "y'all" when I wasn't
Southern. An Earthling would have been amused when I told him "because
English lacks any other unambiguous second-person pronoun, that's
why." It was a carefully polished finishing line that I'd used on any
number of occasions. Sadly, no one here even noticed. Sigh.</p>

<p>"While you're at it, get some food and drinks in here. None of you
have eaten yet." Suze jumped up and dashed out the door, returning
quickly with a train of upstairs servants, each of whom was carrying a
plush chair. The chairs were all mismatched and had clearly been
grabbed from whatever rooms happened to be closest, but they were
chairs.</p>

<p>By the time everyone was comfortably seated, the mania had worn
off. I was still positive and upbeat, but I no longer felt like a
toddler loaded up on espresso and Pixy Stix. Once everyone was
comfortably seated, I looked around the circle, making eye contact
with each of them in turn. "So, this whole staying young and living
forever thing sounds pretty cool to me. Personally, I'm saying we
should surrender. What do y'all think?"</p>

<p>Everyone looked to Thomas. His brow furrowed in thought, and he
answered slowly. "I'm...not sure our duty allows it. All of our
military, and probably many of the regular citizens, would be drafted
into their army and sent off to fight evil undead. All of those people
are part of the Land, and them being sent to kill or be turned into
monsters is not a fate we can permit."</p>

<p>I shrugged. "Ok, good enough. So, we need to figure a way out of
this." Something pinged at the back of my head...if I were actually
from this world I would have thought to myself "hm, I just missed a
Spot check." Since I was a real person, I just felt a slight sense of
wrongness before focusing completely on the problem at hand.</p>

<p>Silence fell.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know! We could&mdash;" I fell silent, pondering the
thought. "Nope, nevermind. Won't work."</p>

<p>Silence kept falling on us.</p>

<p>Ryan raised a finger in thought. "We just need to..." he stopped
thinking hard, then shook his head and put his finger down.</p>

<p>The silence was getting thick on the ground by now.</p>

<p>We stared at each other for a few more minutes, no one having a
useful thought. After a bit, the door opened to admit Franklin leading
a crew of maids and stewards, all laden with food. There was a pause
while we all resettled, passed bread and cheese and meat-pies around,
and chomped into things while trying (mostly unsuccessfully) to catch
the crumbs in our napkins. The only conversation was along the lines
of "pass the cider" or "yummm." (For the record, battle hardened
killing machines should not say 'yum'. It wrecks their street
cred.)</p>

<p>Eventually, feeling far more replete but no more clever, we turned
back to the issue of the day. I still felt boundlessly brave and
optimistic; I <em>knew</em> we'd find a way to defeat the Deorsi and
save the day...I just had no idea how.</p>

<p>"Ok, let's break this into smaller pieces. We need to find out how
they do that resurrection trick and either steal it from them or
sabotage it so we can actually put them in the ground. Same thing for
their mass teleport trick. We also need to find out how much, if any,
of what Albrecht said was true. Finally, we need to figure out how to
bring them to battle at a specific time and place. Anyone got thoughts
on how to accomplish any of those things?"</p>

<p>Silence fell when I asked the first question. Everyone pondered, no
one had an answer.</p>

<p>Snickering started coming from the fireplace. "Hey, I just
remembered!" Allison called. "I heard a poem about you today, Your
High And Mightiness.</p><p style='text-align:center;'><em>"There is a
young man we call Jake<br>He has a great plan he must make<br>His
brain it is said,<br>Bounced in his head<br>For his smarts you see are
all fake."</em></p>

<p>I snorted, amused. "Unkind, but possibly true, Allison. I gotta
admit, guys, I don't see a solution here. If Albrecht was telling the
truth then we can't possibly win this. And sure, maybe everything he
was saying is a lie; we've only got his word for it. But he used a
Wish to transport his people home; he's clearly a caster on the level
of the Archmagi, and he's a general, not a full-time wizard. They
undoubtedly have higher level mages than him. If you want miracles,
you need someone smarter than me, because I've got nothing."</p>

<p>They all looked at me for a moment, frowning in
puzzlement. ~<em><strong>Now</strong></em><em> what?~</em> I
thought. Those expressions always meant that something frustrating was
about to be said.</p>

<p>"What do you mean 'he used a Wish'?" asked Thomas in confusion.</p>

<p>I gaped at him. "You're kidding, right?  Wish is the single best
known spell in the entire D&D game! Ninth level? Wizard spell? Five
thousand Experience, you can do more or less whatever you want?
Ringing any bells here?" I was simply incredulous. How could I be
talking to paladins, sitting in the middle of a castle, with a fire
elemental acting as a space heater, and they <em>didn't know what Wish
was?</em></p>

<p>They all looked at each other and shrugged, then turned back to
me. I sighed; under normal circumstances I would have felt dejected
but whatever Olivia had done (was doing?) was too awesomely full of
awesome sauce, because I felt simply awesome&mdash;bouncy, bubbling,
burbling, a bit babbly...</p>

<p>I reigned my thoughts in and took a quick flip through the
Brainopedia to get the exact spell description.</p>

<p><em>Fzzt. Null pointer exception</em> said the Brainopedia. (Well,
not literally, but that's what it felt like.)</p>

<p><em>~Wait, seriously?! They said this thing had every spell they
knew of, how could it not have Wish?~</em> I checked again.</p>

<p><em>Fzzt. Null pointer exception</em> said the Brainopedia.</p>

<p>I blinked, then looked around in shock. "Ohhhkaay, it's actually
not in the download I got when y'all kidnapped me to this place. Take
my word for it, it's a really, <em>really</em> powerful spell. The
Archmagi could cast it if they knew it which, in a circumstance that I
find more surprising than hearing a Republican suggest funding
welfare, they don't. But no one below their level could cast
it. There's a whole list of things it can do; create or improve magic
items, resurrect people, transport people, I don't remember whatall
else but it's impressive stuff. It costs five thousand Experience but
it's the be-all and end-all of wizard magic...for those wizards who
know it, anyway. Which apparently includes our enemies, but not
us. You know, just in case we weren't screwed hard enough
already."</p>

<p>They shrugged acceptance, which aggravated the kimchee out of
me. Seriously, in what weird-ass universe would someone tell you that
your opponent had casually dropped a superspell in front of you...and
then you just shrugged it off and went on with your day? Wouldn't a
sensible person be asking questions about what it could do, how to
stop it, <em>something?</em> Argh.</p>

<p>Silence reigned for a little while longer before I finally shook my
head. "Guys, I got nothing. Seriously, we need to get someone smarter
than us in here, because we're not getting it done. Maybe the
Archmagi?"</p>

<p>Franklin spoke up, sounding hesitant. "Commander, if our Lord needs
to be smarter, what about giving him one of the Headbands?"</p>

<p>Thomas blinked, looking startled. "Of course! Why didn't I think of
that? Archmage Matthew has been making them to sell; he should have
some extras. Go get one from him, on the bounce."  Franklin was on his
feet and off like a shot, moving at that familiar insanely high
speed.</p>

<p>I shook my head in confusion. "What's this headband you're talking
about?"</p>

<p>Now he was excited. "A Headband of Intellect. It boosts the
intelligence of the wearer. You said we needed someone smarter, well,
you're about to be that someone."</p>
