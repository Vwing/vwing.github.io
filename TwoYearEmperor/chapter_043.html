<p>
"Hey, Albrecht.  You ready to give those undead a beatdown?" I asked
as I walked through the door, grinning wolfishly.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht looked over his shoulder with a raised eyebrow.  "Do come in,
Jake.  A pleasure to see you as well," he added with studied
casualness (and the faintest touch of snark) as he straightened up
from his papers.
</p>

<p>
This was the Gr&#491;fhamr equivalent of the Flobovian War Room,
except smaller.  A central table was covered in maps, lists, and
files; the half a dozen people gathered around it made the room feel
claustrophobically small, despite being incredibly spacious by
Gr&#491;fhamr standards&mdash;at least fifteen feet on a side.  The
presence of myself and Thomas just increased the sardine-like feel of
the place.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht turned back to the people standing around the table with him.
"Pardon us, everyone.  I need to speak to His Imperial Majesty alone.
Let's pick this up tonight at nine, all right?" With nods and murmurs
of assent, the Gr&#491;fhamrite warleaders and advisors squeezed past
us and out the door, leaving the three of us alone.
</p>

<p>
"What's all this?" I asked, gesturing to all the papers. 
</p>

<p>
He shrugged, pointing at various piles as he explained.  "Maps of
various parts of Anundj&aring;, troop strengths and populations of the
Redoubts, supply situations in the Redoubts and the various mobile
bands, known estimates on drauga strength, recent sightings of
Afi...everything needed to run a war."
</p>

<p>
"Huh," I grunted, impressed.  "Ok, so what's the next move?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht smiled, crossing his hands behind his back in a professorial
stance.  "Why don't you tell me?  You've seen an example of the
drauga's strength on our way in.  You've seen much of Gr&#491;fhamr
and our strength.  What <em>is</em> our next move?"
</p>

<p>
A small shot of adrenaline hit me as he put me on the spot and I
fumbled for an answer.  "Well..." I started, running my hand back
through my hair as a momentary stall.  "We need to get rid of that
army on the doorstep.  A big enough antimatter explosion should do
it&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He raised a hand to cut me off.  "Wrong.  Try again."
</p>

<p>
I hmphed in irritation but looked for another option.  What had he
said before?  I was all tactics, no strategy, and I didn't spend
enough time on intelligence gathering?  Ok, so what sort of
intelligence should I be gathering...?
</p>

<p>
"Ok, so...we scout and maybe infiltrate the enemy to find out what
their plans are?" I tried.  I knew this 'think strategically, not
tactically' thing was important, and I wanted to learn it...but it
would have been so much more satisfying to just blow the bad guys the
hell up, find the next group of bad guys, blow <em>them</em> the hell
up, and keep going like that until we were out of bad guys.
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.  "You're still thinking tactically, thinking about
how to hit at the enemy that you can see.  No, the first thing we need
to do is secure our own position.  Before we fought our way in here,
the drauga didn't know where Gr&#491;fhamr was. After we slaughtered
ten or twenty thousand of them and cut a hole in a mountain, it's a
pretty safe bet they know now."
</p>

<p>
I sucked in a breath in alarm; Thomas's eyes widened for a moment.
"I'll have the Landguard deploy outside the entrance," he snapped.
"Just to be sure that nothing takes us by surprise."  He raised his
gauntlet to create a Sending.
</p>

<p>
"Relax," Albrecht said, waving him off.  "I took care of it as soon as
we got inside.  Gr&#491;fhamr is now four thousand miles from where it
was when we came in."
</p>

<p>
We both gaped at him.  "What?" I gasped.  "How...?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht shrugged, looked both amused and slightly smug. "At base,
Gr&#491;fhamr is a Portable Hole protected by a very large
anti-teleportation ward.  We took the ward down, then had a mage pick
up the external Portable Hole and teleport across the country.  We've
done this so often it's a science; the hard part is making sure that
the Hole is oriented exactly the same at the new location as at the
old.  Otherwise when it reopens and the internal gravity aligns itself
to the external environment...well, let's just say it can get messy."
</p>

<p>
I laughed, somewhat manically.  All the grief and misery from earlier
was sloshing around inside me looking for expression and, apparently,
it had decided that rampant giggling was as good a method as any.  It
took a little effort, but I managed to choke it off before Albrecht
and Thomas started seriously considering sending for men in white to
help me into an 'I-hug-me' coat.
</p>

<p>
"Right, ok, so we've gotten out from the middle of the giant trap.  Do
we know for sure that this area is safe?" I inquired, once I had wiped
away the giggle tears.  "Maybe we scout around a bit, just to be
sure?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht smiled and nodded, giving me the look of a teacher pleased at
his student's progress.  "Already being done.  Now, with our position
secure, what would you suggest next?  Commander, any thoughts?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas frowned.  "We aren't actually secure, though.  The undead may
not know where we are, but they'll find us.  Your teleport ward
prevents them from teleporting in, and the fact that we're in an
extradimensional space means that they can't Scry us...the next most
dangerous thing seems to be that trick they have of sending their
wraiths in underground.  Once they locate us again, they could send an
army in like that and we wouldn't know anything about it until they
appeared on top of us."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht nodded soberly.  "Yes, it's one of Afi's favorite tactics.  I
remember one night; we had a campsite with fifty mile visibility in
all directions.  Suddenly, thousands of wraiths and a few dozen ghosts
with caster levels erupted out of the ground and started slaughtering
everyone in reach.  Fortunately, we had some Celestial Brilliance
stones saved up; we unhooded them and started running them around,
vaporizing the undead and creating pockets of safety that the men
could fall back on.  It was horrible."
</p>

<p>
Thomas's face pinched up in shared sadness.  "I'm sorry for your loss.
I take it you didn't have the stones unhooded to start with because
you didn't want to spotlight your position?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht nodded. "Indeed.  We knew Afi and his troops were out there
and that same visibility that gave us warning also made it easy
for <em>them</em> to see <em>us.</em>  Couldn't afford to have the
stones exposed."
</p>

<p>
"Suppose," Thomas offered, "that we dig some holes around the
entrance, drop some Celestial Brilliance stones in, then put a cover
over them?  If the drauga try to come in from underground they'll come
into the pit before they realize it's there, and they'll be instantly
fried by the light.  At the same time, the pit is covered so the light
doesn't leak out and it's still a surprise.  We could even set the
topcover to be pulled aside easily so that the light can wreck
aboveground attackers."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht and I both glanced at him in surprise.  Thomas had always
been a great soldier and commander, but this was the first trace of
military creativity I had seen.  I guess that 'trying to get over his
flaws' thing was working on more than one axis.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht nodded.  "I like it.  We'll have to dig back under the
mountain a bit so they can't go around the pits when they figure out
that they're there, but yes.  That'll solve one of our biggest
tactical weaknesses.  We can use the same strategy in the field, too."
</p>

<p>
"Won't they just go deeper, go under the pits?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
Thomas looked concerned but Albrecht shrugged.  "Not an issue.
Incorporeal creatures must stay adjacent to the outside of whatever
surface they're passing through&mdash;for Medium creatures like
wraiths and shadows that means they need to be within five feet of an
external surface at all times.  We dig the pits, and then use Stone
Shape to drill narrow shafts five feet into the walls and the floor,
each shaft just a few inches wide.  The shafts will be too small to
count as open ground, so the drauga can't go under or around them.
The light will pipe into them so any drauga passing that way will
still be destroyed."
</p>

<p>
I frowned thoughtfully.  "Suppose Afi sends in an elemental, or
something else that isn't harmed by Celestial Brilliance?  All it
would have to do is peel the Portable Hole off the wall and destroy
it.  Everyone would be trapped in here permanently."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht grimaced ruefully.  "Yes, the external Hole is the greatest
weak point of Gr&#491;fhamr.  We have some contingency
plans&mdash;either pick up and relocate the Hole when an attack begins
or, at the least, pull the Hole into the city itself so it's not
vulnerable.  Failing that, use a Forcecage to block the Hole so that
nothing can reach it...there's various plans for various situations.
Still, our primary defenses are secrecy and deception; the undead
don't know where we are, and we move the moment we even think we might
be under threat.  At every location we set up, we hide the entry Hole
in a deep crevice or other inaccessible area and place multiple other
Holes around as decoys.  We also use Magic Aura to hide the emanations
of the true Hole so that it can't be found with Detect Magic."
</p>

<p>
He paused in thought, then continued.  "Actually, the <em>best</em>
defense that we have is that the drauga don't actually want to kill
us.  They want to convert us; we have a lot of high level people in
here that would make excellent minions for the liches.  They'll
confine themselves to non-city-destroying tactics as long as they
think they can capture us and feed us to their pet vampires."
</p>

<p>
Thomas and I nodded, accepting the argument.  Albrecht wiggled his
fingers a bit and a ghost-trout went winging away to set people
digging.
</p>

<p>
"So, back to the main question.  What's the next most strategically
important element we need to deal with?" Albrecht asked in the tone of
a master quizzing a new apprentice.
</p>

<p>
"They must have communication channels;" I responded slowly, thinking
out loud.  "We should find some way to disrupt or spoof those.  With
it, we could direct groups of them into traps, stay ahead of anything
they might be planning, and make them think that the area we were in
had already been searched and so they should look elsewhere."  I
paused for a long moment, thinking.  "They don't eat or drink, so they
don't have normal supply lines, but they do have to create new undead
and move them around, which is sort of a supply line.  If we could
find a way to disrupt that process it would give us much better
options."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht nodded and shrugged.  "Yes, their communications would be an
excellent target.  As to the supply lines...there aren't an
appreciable number of people left, so there can't be any large number
of new undead being created."
</p>

<p>
I cocked my head at that.  "Are you sure?  Wouldn't the Lich Kings go
looking for a way to keep growing their forces?  I can't believe that
they all get along smoothly; my guess is that they're more like
cooperating rulers than a true chain of command.  And if I'm right
about that, then each one is going to want to keep boosting his own
power in order to stay ahead of all the other Lich Kings.  So maybe
they've set up giant cloning banks or something, to keep making people
they can convert."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht suddenly looked worried.  "That's...not unreasonable.  And
yes, it seems to match what I've seen of their methods.  The cloning
idea wouldn't work&mdash;it takes months to create a clone, so it's
not scalable.  Also, it's inert until the original creature dies and
its soul can move into the clone.  But, yes, there might be a way.  I
don't know what, but there might be."
</p>

<p>
"Ok, so if we don't know <em>what</em> it could be, then where and how
would they be doing it?" Thomas put in, cutting to the heart of the
matter.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht gave a worried frown and shook his head.  "I don't know, but
I'll put some people on it."  He wiggled his fingers and sent another
ghost-trout off.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, I had been idly poking through the papers on the desk.
Estimates of the drauga numbers, sightings of their forces,
significant individuals who were known to be converted...everything on
that table carried the same message: you're doomed.
</p>

<p>
Doomed.  Hm.  Why <em>exactly</em> were we doomed?
</p>

<p>
"You want strategic thinking?" I demanded.  "How about this: why is
this happening?  Why do the gods do this wipe-out-the-world thing so
regularly?  Is there a way we could satisfy them that doesn't involve
everyone being dead?  Maybe even a way that would convince them to
un-undeadify all the people that were already killed?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas looked intrigued, but Albrecht just shrugged. "The Union has
spent centuries trying to figure it out.  There's a hundred
theories&mdash;one of them might even be correct, but who can tell?"
</p>

<p>
I frowned in irritation.  "What are some of the theories?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht looked up in thought and started ticking theories off on his
fingers.  "The gods destroy us when we become too sinful and offensive
in their eyes.  Or when we grow too powerful and they fear we might
challenge them.  Or because our use of magic is a violation of the way
they intended the world to work.  Oh, my favorite&mdash;they destroy
us because we allowed halflings citizenship."  He shook his head in
disgust.  "Some people.  Let's see, what else...?  Oh, yes.  They
destroy us because we worship false gods, or gods they are at war
with.  Or because we have not performed their rites correctly and thus
we have contaminated their divine auras.  Or, they destroy us
because&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I raised my hands in a gesture of surrender.  "Ok, I get it.  Too many
theories to be able to tell which is right.  I don't suppose there's
any way to just <em>ask</em>, is there?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht made a moue of disgust.  "Yes, people have tried.  No,
they've never gotten a clear answer.  Gods of anything other than
knowledge aren't motivated to tell, and the gods of knowledge
typically want to maintain a balance between the different factions of
their worshippers, so they don't release major secrets like that to
any one group."  He paused to give me a hairy eyeball.  "Now, if only
there were a god whose domain was knowledge and secrets, and of whom
we were the only worshippers&mdash;someone like, oh, I don't
know, <em>Herr&uacute;n</em>&mdash;then maybe we could have gotten a
straight answer.  Sadly, someone seems to have blown all knowledge of
her right off the planet."
</p>

<p>
I smiled a wicked little <em>I've got a secret</em> smile.  "Well,
just out of curiosity, what would you say if I told you that maybe
not <em>all</em> knowledge of her had been blown off the planet?"
</p>

<p>
Both of them gave me an arched-eyebrow stare.  "I would say 'my, what
excellent news.'" Albrecht offered, making me smile broadly.  "Then I
would say 'my, what an important piece of intelligence you have failed
to share with your Strategos.'"  My smile collapsed.
</p>

<p>
I cleared my throat in embarrassment, even as the blush crept up my
face.  "Yes, well," I faltered.  "Please recall that I was psychotic
until about an hour ago.  Anyway&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht raised a hand.  "Excuse me?  What's this about you being
psychotic?"
</p>

<p>
I shifted uncomfortably.  "Remember I told you that the Archmagi used
a spell on me to make me a better warleader?  They locked away all my
personal memories and took out my remorse, shame, what have you.  Made
me completely ruthless.  I'm guessing they also imprinted a deep
desire to help Flobovia.  Anyway, when I figured it out I was pretty
pissed.  I arranged for two of the Archmagi to kill themselves, I blew
a small village off the map...a few other things.  Anyway, about an
hour ago I used a Wish to undo the magic so, win.  Not an axe-murderer
anymore, yay."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht stared at me in disbelief before rubbing his temples.  "You
had a Wish...and you used it to undo a mind magic spell?"
</p>

<p>
I shifted again, even more uncomfortable.  "It seemed like a good idea
at the time...?"
</p>

<p>
He sighed.  "We have High Magi for that.  All you had to do was tell
us and we could have undone it for you.  There's a lot of things I
could have done with that Wish."
</p>

<p>
My stomach bounced off my shoes and stuck somewhere around my knees.
"Um...oops?" I offered weakly.
</p>

<p>
He sighed again.  "Well, it's done.  Anything else I should know that
you've forgotten to mention?"
</p>

<p>
I thought about that for a second.  I wasn't sure I wanted to tell
Albrecht about the Rule and the Hourglass; those seemed like good
things to have as aces-in-the-hole.  I decided to leave them out for
now and focus on the most important part.
</p>

<p>
"Well, going back to the original thought&mdash;I had to blow up the
temple and all of its contents to satisfy my deal with Loki, but he
forgot to say that I couldn't make copies.  While we were exploring
the place, I sent in teams of scribes and magi to copy as much as they
could of all the texts we found.  We didn't have a lot of time before
I had to take the place out so we only got a fraction of what was
there.  That said, I had them focus on the details of Herr&uacute;n
herself, along with a few topics that I thought would be militarily
useful.  Flobovia has a complete set of her core dogma and major
rituals.  Does that help?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht sagged back against the table, his face crumpling and
shoulders sagging in relief.  He huffed out a couple breaths as he
tried to shift his thinking to account for this sudden resurgence of
hope.  "Yes.  Yes, it helps tremendously.  If we have the bulk of
Gr&#491;fhamr convert to her worship we should be able to resurrect
her and bring her onto our side in the war."
</p>

<p>
I hm'd in interested puzzlement.  "How exactly does that work?  How
can you resurrect a god?  For that matter, how does a god even die,
anyway?  Aren't they, I don't know, <em>immortal</em>?"
</p>

<p>
"Gods draw strength from the faith of their worshippers," Albrecht
responded absently, clearly a million miles away in his thoughts.
"Gods without worshippers become little more than a shadow, without
power or ability to affect the mortal realm.  The more worshippers and
the more faithful they are, the more powerful the god."  He stood up,
turning to face me squarely.  Wonderment and hope suffused his face;
for the first time I realized just how much despair he had been
covering up the entire time I had known him.  "Do you have any idea
what this means for the war?  If Herr&uacute;n is willing to help, we
might actually be able to survive this.  Possibly even regain a bit of
ground, create some Redoubts that are truly safe."
</p>

<p>
I stared at him in confusion.  "Shooting a little low there, aren't
you Al?  How about if we try for 'we could win this thing and kill all
the bad guys'?"
</p>

<p>
He snorted.  "Don't kid yourself.  The drauga have their own gods;
with a billion worshippers, those gods are nigh-omnipotent and most of
them hate all life with a firey passion.  We're not going to defeat
them, or even regain what we once had.  The best we can hope for is to
carve out some space where we can live in safety."  His face became
deadly serious and he looked back and forth between me and Thomas.
"And if either of you breathes a <em>word</em> of that to another
living soul, Anundj&aring;n or Flobovian or anyone else, I will lock
your soul in a very small box and bury it where no one can ever find
it.  The people need to believe that we can win this, that life can
once again be what it was."  He glared back and forth until we both
nodded.  Even Thomas couldn't take offense at the threat, although we
both recognized that the tubby little general was deadly serious.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht let the silence hang in the air, glaring us both down.  After
a moment, I shifted nervously and cleared my throat.  "So, speaking of
terrible segues, how about some tactical talk?  I was thinking.  You
have all these spell engines and such&mdash;is there any way to
produce holy water in bulk?  Because I bet I could do some real damage
that way."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht looked at me with his serious-face for another minute and
then decided to allow the topic change.  His face relaxed into a
wicked smile and he nodded agreement. "As it happens, I can help you
with that.  Come on, I'll show you."  Turning, he led us out of the
room.
</p>

<p>
As we walked, Albrecht explained the complicated hallway etiquette
that dictated who yielded way to whom in the crowded passages of
Gr&#491;fhamr.  It wasn't as simple as rank or level; high level
clerics and important people had to step aside for manual laborers
under certain conditions, and there were scheduled times for recasting
the Rope Tricks, during which the residents had priority over nearly
everyone.  The problem with Rope Trick was that it lasted an hour per
caster level; given that the majority of Gr&#491;fhamrites were only
third to fifth level, their Rope Tricks didn't last long enough for a
full night's sleep.  Instead, it was necessary for one person in each
sleep group to cast the spell, then everyone in that group rest for a
few hours, then come down and have the next person cast it so they
could all climb back up.  It required very careful coordination of who
was assigned to each sleep group and in what order they would cast;
without proper planning, the members of the sleep group would not have
enough rest and study time to re-prepare the spell each day and they
would clog up the hallways even worse than they already were.  Even
more planning was required to make sure that the groups on a given
hallway had staggered recasting times so that they weren't all down in
the corridor at once.
</p>

<p>
The etiquette was interesting, but hard to keep track of.  I solved
the problem by just giving way to anyone who wanted it.
</p>

<p>
It was about a twenty minute walk&mdash;we had to leave the branch we
were on, move back to the backbone tunnel, then go down a different
branch&mdash;but we eventually arrived in an isolated dead-end
corridor filled with Gr&#491;fhamr's holy water production system.
</p>

<p>
A glowing golden chalice the size of a punchbowl was tied to a wooden
frame that kept it angled out over a trough.  Ten Decanters of Endless
Water were tied to the sides of the trough, each blasting out a
firehose stream of water aimed at the chalice.  The water glowed blue
the instant it touched the chalice; the newly-blessed water then fell
down into the trough and was carried down the corridor.  Side channels
piped the water into Portable Holes; a team of workers switched the
Holes every time one filled up.  The full one would then be carried
off into the bowels of this oh-so-strange city.
</p>

<p>
Gr&#491;fhamr was producing three thousand gallons of holy water a
minute.  Seven hundred and twenty <em>tons</em> of holy water per
hour.  Two Seaworld orca tanks of holy water per day.  A gobsmackingly
ginormous amount of holy water per week.
</p>

<p>
"Where do you <em>put</em> it all?" I asked, bewildered.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht laughed.  "Mostly, we drink it and bathe in it; this is the
largest water production facility in the city.  There's a little
overage, which we're stockpiling just outside the city entrance in
case it's needed."
</p>

<p>
Thomas and I both stared at him.  Finally, Thomas cleared his throat.
</p>

<p>
"You...<em>bathe</em> in holy water?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht looked innocent.  "You mean you don't?" he responded, a
twinkle in his eye.
</p>

<p>
Thomas and I both stared at the water production facility in disbelief
as a steady stream of burly men carried magical holes full of holy
water in and out past us.
