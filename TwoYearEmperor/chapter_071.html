<em><strong>Author's Note</strong>:  Still don't own D&D.</em>
</p>

<hr />

<p>
"Hi," I said brightly to, as far as I could tell, the entire pantheon
of Stupidworld gods.  I even waved and smiled.  Last night I had
helped resurrect a goddess.  Right after breakfast I had helped with
the first ever non-destructive uploading procedure, and followed it
off by killing a god.  Well, imprisoning a god for all eternity.
Well, helping to imprison...okay, standing by and watching while my
executive assistant imprisoned a god for all eternity.  Anyway, my
capacity for being afraid or amazed had been kinda exhausted for the
day.
</p>

<p>
"Pleased ta meetcha, y'all," I said, still smiling.  "I'm Jake, how're
you?"
</p>

<p>
<strong>"Be silent, mortal.  Our business is not with you,"</strong>
said Mr. McBigStrongGod from his place to my left.
</p>

<p>
"Hey folks, good to see you all again.  Miss me?" Herr&uacute;n asked
with a flippant grin, growing to match the height of the other gods as
she stepped forward into the circle.  She was still in her
sixteen-year-old redhead body, but she was dressed in an elegant blue
pantsuit combination, with tasteful silver necklace and earrings.
Loki took up position on her right side, clad in a very elegant
version of his Harlequin motley.  That was disturbing all in
itself&mdash;if the two of them were taking this moment seriously
enough to dress up, things really <em>were</em> as bad as I suspected.
</p>

<p>
Maht, the God of War, frowned at her, then glanced at
Amilsandre.  <strong>"I see you did not exaggerate, my sister.  Truly,
she has returned."</strong>  He turned back to Herr&uacute;n with a
frown.  <strong>"Greetings, little cousin.  We shall evaluate you and
determine your new place later, but there is business to manage
first. For now, await us in the Halls."</strong>
</p>

<p>
"Yeah, about that," Herr&uacute;n said, examining her long
silver-and-blue nails with feigned disinterest.  "Things are going to
go a little differently this time.  See, all
of <em>you</em>"&mdash;she swept her hand across a broad swath of the
circle, then pointed at several other gods individually&mdash;"are
already thinking about how to get rid of me, and the rest of you are
figuring out how to get an alliance with me to get rid of one of the
others.  That's not going to fly this time.  This time, I'm going to
take my place in the Halls and none of you are going to give me crap
about it.  I will not be taking direction about who I may induct as
worshippers or what boundaries I must place on my portfolio."  She
raised a hand to cut off one of the gods on the far side of the
circle; from his rage-infused face, I'm pretty sure he was about to
start bellowing.
</p>

<p>
<strong>"There. Will Be.  <em>No</em> Interference,"</strong> she
informed them coldly.  She eyed them for a moment and then her face
relaxed back into the sardonic look she'd had at the beginning.  "Oh,
and, just so you know&mdash;I've already created constructs, scattered
all over the world.  Should I stop managing my portfolio again
because, oh, just to choose a random example, <em>I'm dead</em>, then
these constructs will transmit their contents to every mortal on the
planet.  In them, I've stored some lovely little nuggets about how
gods are created from stories, how we're sustained by worship, how
mortals can actually control us just by changing their beliefs on a
wide enough scale...oh yes, and lots and lots and <em>lots</em> of
personal details about each and every one of you."  She glanced over
at Maht (aka 'God-of-the-thunderous-expression').  "For example,
coz...I'd imagine you don't really want anyone knowing about what
happened at White Lake between you and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
<strong>"ENOUGH!"</strong> he thundered, raising a hand.
Herr&uacute;n stopped talking to give him an 'oh, <em>really</em>?'
sort of look.
</p>

<p>
Maht glanced around the circle at the other gods; they were looking
at him with looks that ranged from 'curious' through 'reproving' and
on to 'predatory.'  I could see the gears turning in his head as he
saw all this; an expression of distaste flashed across his face as he
realized he was going to have to retrench instead of plowing forward.
</p>

<p>
<strong>"Your points are well taken, cousin,"</strong> he ground
out.  <strong>"Please, won't you take your place and join us for the
judgement?"</strong>
</p>

<p>
Beside me, Suze was looking uncomfortable.  Apparently my capacity for
fear wasn't all <em>that</em> exhausted, because the word 'judgement'
didn't do good things for my stomach either.
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n gave him a brilliant smile.  "But of course, O cousin
mine.  Let's off to the Halls."  She raised a hand and the world fell
out from under me.
</p>

<p>
An instant later I was standing in the center of what looked
remarkably like an open-air Roman amphitheatre...you know, the ones
where folks used to watch charming family-friendly shows like 'Eat the
Christians, Lions!'  and 'Kill the Gladiator, Other Gladiator!'
Good, clean, wholesome fun.
</p>

<p>
Horrifying imagery aside, the place was quite lovely; open to the air,
the floor of the amphitheatre was thirty feet across and covered in
fine white sand, a dozen rings of seats ascending up to the back of
the room.  At the top, a circle of honest-to-god Corinthian pillars
held up a ring of white marble veined with gold.  The open sky above
us was brilliant blue with just enough clouds to make it interesting;
the land visible beyond the pillars was verdant, rolling, and as
ridiculously perfect as something out of a Bob Ross painting.  I
sincerely hoped that this place was just so divinely ineffable that my
brain was filling in the blanks with castoff imagery it dug up in my
mental basement, because the level of clich&eacute; made me want to
heave.
</p>

<p>
It had not escaped my notice that Suze and I were standing in the
exact center of the arena while the gods sat in a remarkably judge-y
fashion in the bleachers around us.
</p>

<p>
<strong>"Mortals, you stand in judgement before the Divine Council for
the crime of deicide,"</strong> announced Maht, as he rose to his
feet and towered over us.  (The ten foot height difference between the
floor of the arena and the first set of seats was enough to let him
tower; his current thirty-foot stature was purely
overkill.)  <strong>"Our brother is dead&mdash;vanished from our
sight, beyond call of our voices.  We cannot hear his thoughts nor
scent even the shards of his power upon the aether.  You will reveal
to us how you wrought this blasphemy, and then your doom shall be
determined."</strong>
</p>

<p>
Suze was trembling and pale beside me, eyes so wide she looked like an
anime character.  "I- I- I'm sorry, Divine Ones," she stuttered.
"I&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Quickly, I talked right over her, pushing the volume to drown her
out. "I imprisoned him!" I cried.  "She said it was a bad idea," I
said, gesturing towards Suze, "but I did it anyway.  It was the only
way to stop him from killing us all."  The gods weren't drowning us in
their divine auras so I wasn't collapsed in quivering jelly-like
terror, but I was still plenty scared.  Didn't mean I wasn't going to
do my best to save Suze, though.
</p>

<p>
"You gods and your bullshit power trips!" I cried, a lifetime of
frustration at religion boiling over.  "<em>This</em>, this right here
is why you're so goddamned harmful to humanity!  You purport to be the
patrons of your worshippers, and then you go and let your petty
politics run over us, kill <em>billions</em>!  I thought religion was
bad in my world but oh wow do you guys take the cake!  At least in my
world it was just an oppressive, thought-suppressing, unrealistic
source of persecution and occasional bloodbaths!  Here, you guys are a
damn <em>extinction event</em>!  And you have the bloody <em>gall</em>
to sit in judgement over us for defending oursel&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I was on the floor of the arena, covering my head and mewling in
horror as Maht's eyes glittered and he shattered my mind with a
disapproving glance.
</p>

<p>
<strong>"You will mind your <em>place</em>, mortal,"</strong> Maht
growled.  <strong>"You will answer Our questions promptly and with
respect, or We shall tear the knowledge from your bleeding skull.  We
question you aloud solely because it is considered <em>polite</em> to
do so, but if you speak to Us like that again, I will personally pull
the shards of your memory from your pulsing wet brain and then rend
your soul to shards."</strong>
</p>

<p>
"D-does it m-m-matter what we d-d-did, Divine One?" Suze
stammered.  "Weren't you at war with Lord Death?  Wasn't he trying to
extinguish all life in the world and kill you all?"
</p>

<p>
<strong>"He was still Our brother, mortal,"</strong> Maht said,
giving her a disapproving glare.  It didn't have quite as much divine
rage powering it as the one he'd given me, but it still made her go
sheet-white and drop to her knees, tears streaming down her cheeks in
fear.
</p>

<p>
Once he saw that she was thoroughly cowed, Maht turned away from us
to talk with some of the gods around him.  A curtain of shimmering
heat waves sprang up between us and them, hiding their voices and
making it impossible even to read their lips.
</p>

<p>
I wasn't paying attention to that, though.  I thought I'd been
frightened before, when Ilara and Loki had turned their power on me; I
had been wrong.  Goddess of Travelers, God of Tricks...neither of them
amounted to much on the divine scale.  Maht, the God of War...he was
an entirely different beast.  His power had hit like an atom bomb,
blowing my awareness to fragments.
</p>

<p>
Fragments, though&mdash;not nothingness.  The top of my brain was
terrified, quaking under the leftover impact of Maht's gaze.
Everything that dealt with any sort of higher function or anything
beyond simple breathing was utterly consumed in a layer of ice and
fear.  There was no <em>me</em> there anymore, just fear.
</p>

<p>
Underneath it, though, was a core of anger that burned a tiny little
hole in the ice.  A hole where something like a <em>self</em> could
gather.  Inside that little hole, a basic core of me existed and it
was <em>angry</em>.  Maht wasn't maintaining the fear on me; he had
swatted me down with it and then turned aside, leaving the fear to run
its course, receding slowly over time.  And because all I was
experiencing was the leftovers, there was space to push back.  I knew
that the fear I was feeling was a flat lie; it had been imposed on me
from the outside, it wasn't something I actually felt for myself.
</p>

<p>
Once again, someone from this world was screwing with my mind.
</p>

<p>
Worse, he had made Suze cry.  And that just. Pissed. Me. <em>Off.</em>
</p>

<p>
I battered at the fear, widening the little hole I resided in.  I was
aware again, my brain working; the fear was apart from me, a separate
thing that lay over my awareness like a blanket.  I could feel it; it
controlled me and flattened me under its weight, but it wasn't part
of <em>me.</em>  I found the boundaries of it, breathed, pushed back
at it, recited my mangled Bene Gesserit Litany Against Fear, focused
on the rage...I did everything I knew to regain control.  Very slowly,
over the course of several minutes, it worked.
</p>

<p>
I staggered to my feet, unsteady but defiant.
</p>

<p>
"Coward," I said quietly.
</p>

<p>
Maht turned back to me, fury rising on his
face.  <strong>"What. Did. You. Say?"</strong> he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"You heard me," I snarled.  "Coward.  You can't defend yourself on
rational grounds, so you strike me down with your magic.  Coward.
You're nothing but a bully; Maht, God of War...coward and bully,
afraid to fight on even footing, only picks on those weaker than
himself."
</p>

<p>
He stood there, just looking at me the way you would look at a beetle
that had just challenged you to a duel.
</p>

<p>
<strong>"I'm the God of War you idiot, not the God of Foolishly
Honorable Combat,"</strong> he told me with a dismissive
snort.  <strong>"In war, you don't handicap yourself; you destroy your
opponents with every advantage you have.  Now be silent."</strong>  He
turned back to his discussion, crushing me back to the earth with a
negligent wave of two fingers.
</p>

<p>
He hadn't put the same effort into it this time though&mdash;I suspect
because he was more irked than angry.  The fear rammed me into the
ground, but now I knew that it could be fought, and I knew how.  I
pushed it aside again; it went more quickly this time.
</p>

<p>
I struggled back to my knees, shuffled to Suze and pulled her out of
her fetal crouch, forcing her to sit up.
</p>

<p>
"Suze. Look at me, Suze," I said, giving her a tiny shake to catch her
attention.  Her head came up slowly; I doubt she could see very much
through the tears that were still pouring from her eyes, but she was
at least looking in the right direction.
</p>

<p>
I leaned in close, cupping her face in my hands so she had to look at
me.  "Suze, it's a lie," I whispered intently.  "It's not you feeling
the fear, it's being pushed on you," I told her.  "It's just a lie.
Set it aside; recognize the lie and reject it.  Look for the truth:
you aren't really afraid."  It wasn't helping, so I shifted tacks.
"C'mon Suze, don't let them win.  They're all exactly the same as
those nobles back at the castle&mdash;self-centered, thoughtless,
egotistical bastards, hurting everyone because they're too busy
wallowing in their own power and how awesome they think they are.
They're <em>not</em> awesome, they're just bullies!  You <em>killed a
god</em>, Suze.  <em>The</em> god, the most powerful of them all.
We're here because <em>they're</em> afraid of <em>you</em>, not the
other way around.  If necessary, we'll get rid of all of these ones,
too.  C'mon, hon, snap out of it.  Get angry, it helps.  C'mon."
</p>

<p>
Slowly, she dug her way back to consciousness, pushing Maht's fear
aura aside.  She sniffed one last time and brushed the tears away.
</p>

<p>
Some women have the complexion to cry and still look beautiful; Suze
didn't. Her face was all blotchy and her nose was red and sniffly.
"You look awful, kiddo," I told her with a teasing half-smile.
</p>

<p>
She tried to glare at me, still sniffling, but then gave a choking
laugh.  "You're mean, M'Lord," she said, the grateful tone belying the
words.
</p>

<p>
<em>~If you wish to protect her, I would recommend against saying out
loud that it was the child who killed Neklos,~</em> whispered Loki's
voice in my head.  From Suze's startled expression she heard it
too.  <em>~I had a feeling you might say something stupid just then,
so I blocked the sound of your voice from reaching the others.  I
wouldn't rely on that too much; I can't do it if the others are
paying attention.~</em>
</p>

<p>
My stomach sank; I really had nearly pooched it right there.  If
anyone was going to get smited (smote? smoted?  smot? whatever) for
this, it really should be me; it had been my idea from soup to nuts,
and Suze had only been there because she wanted to help.
</p>

<p>
<em>~Also, <strong>try</strong> not to pointlessly make Maht angry,
would you?~</em> Herr&uacute;n whispered in our minds.  <em>~This
situation isn't beyond salvaging.  In fact, I think it can work out
very well.  Just...don't muddy the waters.  They'll be asking you
questions in a moment.  Be polite.~</em>
</p>

<p>
Just as her telepathic whisper finished, Maht turned back to us.
</p>

<p>
<strong>"State your case, mortal,"</strong> he told me.  <strong>"Tell
Us how you killed Our brother."</strong>
</p>

<p>
I glanced at Herr&uacute;n and Loki, sitting quietly to one side.
Herr&uacute;n gave me a fractional nod and an encouraging smile.  Loki
winked at me and flashed a thumbs-up that he kept carefully out of
Maht's line of sight.
</p>

<p>
"We- I didn't kill him," I said, pulling myself upright and speaking
as firmly as I could.  Again, I was careful not to look at Maht's
eyes; I kept my gaze on the decorations of his chest plate.  <em>~Now
that's workmanship,~</em> I thought, my brain disassociating in order
to deal with the (this time, completely real and not at all externally
imposed) fear that was crawling through my stomach.  <em>~The mithral
inlay really sets off the blued steel nicely.~</em>
</p>

<p>
From my four o'clock, a god called, "How can you say that?  We felt
him vanish from the multiverse.  Even now, I can feel the hole where
his power should lie.  At this moment, death is in
abeyance&mdash;nothing on Earth may die while the portfolio of Death
lies unsupervised."
</p>

<p>
"Huh," I said in pleased surprise, turning to face the unknown god.
"That's...actually really awesome.  Can we leave it unsupervised?" I
asked.  "Because, see, I have this thing about death being bad and how
it's much better for people to live...."
</p>

<p>
<strong>"Death is bad, you say?"</strong> Maht demanded, still
speaking in his Big God On Campus voice.  <strong>"Tell that to the
man lying crushed and broken at the bottom of a cliff.  Or the child
who was just run over by the oxcart.  Or the woman too old to walk,
wracked with pain in her joints.  Death has its place, mortal.  Now,
tell us what you did."</strong>
</p>

<p>
"Yeah, but see, those things don't <em>have</em> to be like that," I
said, excited.  "With enough high-level clerics and magi, all of those
problems can be fixed.  The Deorsi rejuvenate people all the time,
everyone who's hurt can be fixed with a few Cure or Heal spells...it
could be great!  The mortals all get to live forever, which is awesome
for them.  You'd get lots of worship, which is awesome for you.
People would get to be with their loved ones"&mdash;Herr&uacute;n's
frantic headshake suddenly cut through my excited
babble&mdash;"oooorrrrr, I could shut up and answer the question.
</p>

<p>
"Right, sorry...uhm...ah, yes," I stumbled, trying to find my place in
the story.  "So, I didn't actually kill Neklos. He's just trapped in
time dilation...he'll teleport out of it next round, but 'next round'
for him will be 'the lifetime of the universe' for us. See&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Impossible!" said a goddess from my eleven o'clock.  She carried a
fishing net and wore a crown of kelp, so I was guessing she was either
Goddess of the Ocean or of Fish People.  "Gods are immune to
entrapment by any magic a mortal may wield.  We cannot be imprisoned
in time or space!"  She turned to her side and called out to a god I
well remembered.  "Clearly, he's deceiving us.  Arros, straighten his
lying tongue!"
</p>

<p>
<strong>"Zone of Truth,"</strong> Arros declared, tossing a handful of
silver-green sparks over the center of the arena.  I felt something
settle over me and dig itself into my brain; instantly, I knew I would
not be able to tell a lie even if my life depended on it.  Which was a
bit problematic, since it very well might.
</p>

<p>
Internally, I poked at the feeling, trying to locate its edges.  After
a moment, I sighed in relief; whatever it was, it was strong but there
was no intelligence behind it.  It wouldn't prevent me from being
deceptive, only from speaking actual untruths.
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't lying," I said firmly.  "Neklos is not dead, he is simply
trapped outside of time.  You gods are immune to magics that would
entrap you, but you're still affected by physics...well, somewhat,
anyway.  I just happen to know how to change the laws of physics,
that's all."  
</p>

<p>
A sussurance of disturbed whispers went through the bleachers as gods
and goddesses turned to their neighbors in alarm and confusion.
Quickly, I seized the focus back.  My best bet was to keep talking,
keep their attention where I wanted it to be instead of on
uncomfortable topics such as 'who actually did the deed?'
</p>

<p>
"See, there's this theory in my world&mdash;that's 'Theory' with a
capital 'T' in the sense of 'here is the concise summary of a
well-understood topic' not as in 'here's an idea that we think might
kinda sorta be somewhere near right.'  Anyway, it's called the Theory
of Relativity, and it was created by a really smart guy named
Einstein.  It predicts a lot of things, but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
<strong>"Get to the <em>point,</em> mortal,</strong> Maht told me, a
warning chill in his voice.
</p>

<p>
I held my hands up placatingly.  "Right, sorry.  Well, if you want to
stop time without using magic, the Theory of Relativity is your
ticket.  It talks about how time and space are affected by unusual
circumstances&mdash;really high speeds, or really intense gravity.
Anyway, there's this special thing you can get in very specific
circumstances; it's called a black hole.  On the edge of a black
hole&mdash;and, it turns out, inside it&mdash;time stops...but only
from the perspective of the outside universe.  Neklos is inside a
black hole right now, doing whatever he's doing, and everything seems
perfectly normal for him.  On his next round he'll probably teleport
himself back here.  From our perspective though, time isn't moving
where he is, so by the time 'his next round' comes along, it will be
millions of years, probably longer."  I paused, frowning.  "Actually,
probably much longer.  I'd be surprised if the universe was still here
by the time he got out."
</p>

<p>
"And where else would the universe be?" demanded a divinity of unknown
gender at my ten o'clock.  He-she-it was covered head to toe in a
brown monk's robe, the shadows of the hood covering his/her face
completely.  Tucked in the crook of the left arm was a giant book, the
size of the one's in Loki's library&mdash;<em>~The Library!~</em> I
thought in sudden shock.  <em>~Most of the Landguard are still in
there; I need to get another key from Loki, let them out...Hm.  I
wonder if we could dive in there and bunker down?  Would the gods be
able to see us?  Yeah, almost certainly.  Okay, never mind.~</em>
</p>

<p>
The whole train of thought had flashed through my head in just a few
seconds, but I'd still lost a bit of what the god/dess with the book
had been saying.  I tuned back in just in time to hear the end of it:
"&mdash;in the Book about an end to the multiverse.  <strong>It Is Not
Written And Therefore It Shall Not Be.</strong>" S/he sat down firmly.
</p>

<p>
All the divine eyes turned back to me with expressions that ranged
from curious to accusing.  I just shrugged.  "Hey, don't blame me.  As
far as I know, the universe either ends up with a Big Crunch or a Big
Chill"&mdash;the magic of the truth field stabbed me, forcing my
tongue to shape more words to cover the case I hadn't initially
thought of&mdash;"oh, or it could be flat and stop expanding at some
point but not recollapse.  I think.  Not sure; that's not really my
field."
</p>

<p>
Maht was opening his mouth to demand further explanations, but
Herr&uacute;n climbed calmly to her feet, catching the eyes of
everyone in the arena.
</p>

<p>
"My fellows, does this testimony matter?" she asked in a reasonable
voice.  "The mortal has said his piece&mdash;Neklos is trapped outside
the universe and will not be returning...at least, not anytime soon.
It doesn't matter whether the mortal is correct or not&mdash;he has
given us the truth as he knows it, and further questions will not get
different answers.  The key point, however, is that the war is over.
Surely the important thing now is to pick up the pieces?  We must
bring death back to the world as soon as possible."  She turned
slightly to face Maht and gave him a polite bow.  "I move that the
portfolio of Death be awarded to Maht, Lord of War.  Death and War
are closely related, and Maht has revealed himself a capable
administrator of a complex portfolio. I feel he would be the best for
the role."  Angry voices began to surge up on all sides.
</p>

<p>
"Failing that!" Herr&uacute;n called, talking over the other voices
loudly enough to cut them off.  "Failing that, I would suggest that
Ashtia, Lady of Nature, be given the portfolio.  Nature is the source
of all life; Life and Death are two sides of the same coin.  The
duties of Death will be familiar from her work with her existing
portfolio."
</p>

<p>
If the voices had been surging before, now they were boiling.  Angry
shouts rose up on all sides; gods and goddesses leaped to their feet, 
yelling at each other and waving their fists in rage.
</p>

<p>
I just stared in bemusement at the sight of four dozen gods squabbling
like kindergarteners; when I looked over, Suze was equally slack-jawed
in amazement.  A glance at Herr&uacute;n and Loki, on the other hand,
showed them to both be wearing quietly satisfied smiles&mdash;Loki's,
in fact, was much more of a smirk than a smile.
</p>

<p>
I chuckled in realization of what Herr&uacute;n had just done: she'd
thrown the apple of discord among all the gods and goddesses, as none
of them would be willing to let one of the others add the power of
such a major portfolio to their own.
</p>

<p>
I sat down, leaning back on my hands as I waited for the gods to
either come to blows or come to some sort of settlement.  Suze sat
down beside me, her shoulder brushing up against mine in instinctive
search for comfort.  I noticed the contact and enjoyed it...not for
the 'ooh, sexy girl touching me' thing, just for the pleasure of touch
from another human.  Even though we weren't being actively threatened
or terrified right now, it was good to have a tactile reminder that I
wasn't alone. I suspect Suze felt the same way.
</p>

<p>
I wasn't sure what Herr&uacute;n was angling for here&mdash;presumably
at some point she would suggest a compromise candidate, someone who
actually <em>could</em> be accepted by the divine general populace.  I
had no idea who, though; I couldn't imagine there was any chance they
would give Herr&uacute;n the portfolio, and Loki was almost equally
unlikely.  Maybe there was a minor god or goddess that people would
feel safe elevating?  
</p>

<p>
The argument raged on and on; there wasn't really any way to tell time
since I wasn't wearing a watch, the sun didn't move across the sky,
and I didn't seem to be getting hungry or need to pee.  If I had to
guess, I'd say it was an hour or so before I noticed the oddity.
</p>

<p>
Loki and Herr&uacute;n were sitting quietly, just observing.  Most of
what I took to be the minor gods and goddesses&mdash;some I recognized
from their descriptions in <em>Divinities and Semi-Mortals</em>,
others I could guess at from their clothes and
accountrements&mdash;anyway, most of the minor gods and goddesses were
waiting quietly while their superiors went at it hammer and tongs.
</p>

<p>
The one exception was Arros, God of Magic.
</p>

<p>
Arros was the only greater god who did not partake in the 'fun' of
constant arguments and occasional fisticuffs (all of which were
rapidly broken up by the surrounding bystanders).  Instead he sat
quietly, a smile on his face and a twinkle in his eye as he waited for
people to get it out of their system.  Eventually, when things had
started to calm down a little bit, he rose to his feet and tapped his
staff gently on the ground.  The tap was gentle, but it still sent a
resounding <em><strong>skoom!</strong></em>  rolling off into the
distance.  Instantly, things were quiet and everyone was looking at
him in startlement.
</p>

<p>
"My brothers, my sisters...this gets us nowhere," he said.  His voice
was calm, but it rang out, easily audible across the entire arena.  "I
propose a different solution: trial by combat." He paused to look
around at the suddenly solemn&mdash;frightened?&mdash;expressions of
the other gods and goddesses.

"Under the Law, should two gods engage in direct combat, the victor
shall claim the loser's portfolio," Arros reminded them.  "Currently
the position of Death stands open, and must be filled.  Casting all
artifice aside, I say what everyone is thinking: many of us would like
the portfolio, and all of us are reluctant for any of our opponents to
have it.  Therefore, the solution is simple: we allow simple strength
to claim the prize."
</p>

<p>
Arros turned and pointed right at us.  "It was young Suze of Capital
City who cast the spell that imprisoned our brother.  I say we
award <em>her</em> the portfolio of Death."

<em><strong>Author's goodbye:</strong> That's it folks!  2YE is over,
done, finito, complete, wrapped, finished.  It's been a hell of a
ride, and I hope you all enjoyed it.  (Which, if you read through
300,000 words, you probably did.)</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Ha ha, I'm such a funny guy.  This is the end of Book I.  Book II
will start next week, in this same thread.  See you then!</em>

<em><strong>Author's Note, part deux: </strong> Jake is wrong about
the options for the universe.  Google 'shape of the universe' to see
the actual possibilities.</em>

<em><strong>Author's Note, supplemental:</strong> I'm selling spinoff
stories over
on <a href="http://greendogpress.blogspot.com">GreenDogPress</a>
(greendogpress. blogspot. com). The first item is a novelette entitled
"One Hot Night"; as of this writing, it's on sale for $1 (price may
increase later). It does NOT use any copyrighted material, meaning
that it's legal for me to sell.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>I intend to keep 2YE itself free, and I have no intention of
stopping until the story is done, regardless of how many sales of
spinoff work I do or don't get.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>The blurb for "One Hot Night" is:</em>
</p>
<p>
"In a society without death, Ingfred is 20 years old and has no
prospects. All the good jobs are filled by undying masters of their
craft, and it's hard to be taken seriously when you are, compared to
everyone around you, an infant.  Fortunately, he has a solution:
undergo an illegal transformation and sell the memory to The
Experiental Herald for a ridiculous sum.
</p>

<p>
There's two problems: how can Ingfred convince a powerful wizard to
risk his mage license and his freedom to help with such a crazy plan?
And, once that's done...how will Ingfred deal with the law?"
</p>
