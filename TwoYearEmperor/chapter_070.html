<p>
I found myself sprawled on the rocky floor of the Gr&#491;fhamr canyon
with an armful of warm girl on top of me.  I'm not sure if Suze was
wearing perfume or not, but she smelled <em>fantastic.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>~Down boy!~</em> I told myself firmly.  <em>~Works for you.  Also,
just baaarely not jailbait.  And half your age.  Perv.~</em>
</p>

<p>
"Cough, cough," Loki said, his voice shot through with wild
insinuations.  (Also, who actually <em>says</em> 'cough, cough'?!)
"Should I make a room for you two?"
</p>

<p>
Suze blushed crimson and hastily scrambled off of me.  I was a bit
slower; I took a moment to think about glaciers, icy showers, deserts,
and everything I could think of related to golf.  Once I felt
confident in my ability to not embarrass myself, I pushed myself
upri&mdash;I climbed to my feet.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, why are we not dead?" I demanded of the world in general.  "And
why isn't there a giant evil death god of deathy deathness descending
on us with fire and sword and death right now?" I turned to the author
of my aliveness.  "Suze, what did you...how did you...."  I stopped.
Took a breath.  "Suze, could you please explain what happened after we
all went through the Teleportation Circle?"
</p>

<p>
Her shoulders hunched a little bit, and there was just a bit of
hesitance in her voice, but she spoke right up and met my eyes.  "The
Ice Assassins Mindscraped us, M'Lord, and then they took everything we
had, so&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I waved her to silence.  "Yes, I was there for that part.  Right now
I'm actually a bit stuck between 'how did you come up with that plan',
'how did you keep it secret from the Mindscrape', 'how are you
suddenly casting ninth level spells'&mdash;actually no, you obviously
went through the FLEA.  But <em>when?</em>  You've been beside me this
whole time."
</p>

<p>
She shook her head in firm negation.  "No, M'Lord.  When I asked
permission to go get the magic items, I got them...and I also went
through the POPEs and the FLEA.  I had a little trouble with the
FLEA&mdash;none of the people operating it knew who I was, so at first
they didn't want to let me cut in the line.  When I told them I was
your assistant and showed that paper, one of the senior magi thought
he remembered seeing me with you at one point, so they let me
through."
</p>

<p>
I started to ask 'but why did you want to?' and realized what a stupid
question that was.  <em>I</em> had wanted great cosmic power with
which to make reality my chewtoy&mdash;why shouldn't Suze want that?
There was a better question.
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you tell us, Suze?" I asked in confusion.  "Why keep it
secret?"
</p>

<p>
She looked at me and just for a moment there was anger behind her
eyes.  "Why did I have to do it myself, M'Lord?  Why didn't you send
me through when you tried to go?"  She raised her chin; the anger was
there, and also a lifetime of carefully hidden resentment.  "I'm
a <em>servant</em>, M'Lord.  No one thinks about the servants when
there's great things afoot...just when they need a meal, or a pen, or
a bedwarmer."  Her gaze lost focus as she looked into her own
memories; a tiny, hard little smile twisted across her mouth.
"They'll remember me <em>now,</em> though," she murmured, so quietly I
almost didn't hear.
</p>

<p>
She shook herself, snapping back to the present.  "This was my chance
to be <em>safe,</em> M'Lord.  Wizard, sorceror, cleric, rogue...I can
out-fight any of the nobles in the land with a sword, or I can elude
their best hunters, or I can just turn them into bugs and step on
them."
</p>

<p>
I nodded, shamefaced.  "I'm sorry.  You're absolutely right, I should
have sent you through.  It was thoughtless, and I apologize."  
</p>

<p>
She looked at me with incredulity.  "Um...you're welcome, M'Lord.
er...forgiven?"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Dame Suze," I said, smiling.  I had a feeling people
didn't typically apologize to Suze.  "Speaking of which, given that
you just killed...well, trapped...a god and, oh yes, <em>saved the
world</em>, I think we should probably find some better titles for
you.  And some income.  And whatever the heck else you've ever dreamed
of."
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n snickered quietly but stayed silent.
</p>

<p>
A flash of disgust went across Suze's face.  "No thank you, M'Lord.
As an Archmage I'll have no trouble making or acquiring whatever I
need and, besides, money is a bit irrelevant now, isn't it?  After
what you did with the shops?  As to titles and positions...."  Her
features had smoothed into the well-practiced smiling calm of a
life-long servant.  "...Why would I want to be a noble, M'Lord?  I
would prefer to simply make sure that my family and loved ones have
the opportunity to go through the FLEA as well.  Afterwards, we'll
probably move out of the castle."
</p>

<p>
I bowed my head in acquiescence.  "Whatever you like.  Although, now
that we aren't dealing with invading armies or world-ending crises, my
next goal is to fix things in Flobovia.  Get rid of indentured
servitude, make it so that the nobles can't abuse their power the way
they have been, fix...well, everything basically.  If you wanted to, I
could use an advisor on that."  I smiled ruefully, rubbing my neck.
"It hasn't escaped my attention that I tend to go off half-cocked, and
that I often make a bigger mess than I solve.  You
are...<em>really</em> good at planning ahead, as this little escapade
showed."  I frowed.  "Speaking of which, how exactly <em>did</em> you
do all that?"
</p>

<p>
She hesitated, choosing her words carefully.  "Your plan
was...complicated, M'Lord."  She saw the sting she'd delivered and
hurried to smooth it over.  "Oh, it made perfect sense for what we
expected to face, and Strategos Albrecht simplified it and came up
with all those backup plans but...nothing that was intended to cover
what we actually faced."
</p>

<p>
She wasn't wrong.  The original plan had been all kinds of fancy;
fortunately, Albrecht had smoothed it down.  His version had been
fairly straightforward: Alpha Squad was to handle physical and magical
defense; Thomas, Duncan, Unn, and Albrecht were to dispel any magic
that would prevent us from escaping; Drifa and Colborn were 'free
safeties', responsible for countermage shoots and any miscellaneous
issues; Reynard and Isaac were to use stacked Celerities to get an
action ahead of Neklos and create the singularity that would trap him.
Those two hadn't known what they were going to be casting, of course,
or even that it would be directed against Neklos.  I had only revealed
that part right before we left, on the paper I'd passed around.
</p>

<p>
Still...all of those roles had been deemed vital.  How in
the <em>world</em> had Suze pulled it off all on her own?
</p>

<p>
"I mean, I get the basics," I said.  "You cast the Plane Shift to get
us out of there, then interrupted it with a Celerity to get a readied
action so you could create the singularity zero time before we
vanished.  And you were able to throw the antimatter because it's a
free action to pull things from your spell component
pouch&mdash;which, let me add, is still bullshit&mdash;and your spell
component pouch just randomly contains any spell component you could
need for any spell and blah blah Major Creation needs a sample of the
material so antimatter and blah blah.  What I want to know is how you
knew it would <em>work</em>?  Afi should have had a Dimensional Lock
on his fortress that would prevent the Plane Shift from working.  And
Neklos should have been able to Celerity after you to go first and
interrupt you.  How the hell did that all go off?"
</p>

<p>
She shrugged.  "Well, M'Lord...Afi wanted us to win so of course he
would have taken down his Dimensional Lock.  And if you're caught in a
surprise round you don't get to act...even if you're a god."  That
hint of resentment was back on her face as she said, "And, of course,
wouldn't <em>you</em> be surprised if a meek little servant, obviously
terrified out of her mind, suddenly started casting spells at you?"
</p>

<p>
I laughed ruefully.  "Yeah, I guess I would.  So, what was the
antimatter for?  The whole point of the exercise was to <em>not</em>
kill Neklos, just to trap him in the time dilation from the black
hole.  And besides, you specified 'enough to destroy a twenty foot
radius' which wasn't enough to reach Nekl&mdash;oh."  I shook my head
in disgust at my own obtuseness.  "Of course.  The gems.  You
destroyed the gems so that Thomas and the others' spirits would be
free and we could resurrect them after we escaped.  Damn, that's
slick."  I nodded slowly, working back through the logic.  "And you
specified antimatter <em>osmium</em>, which means you probably heard
about it from Isaac bitching about how I tricked him into blowing
himself up...but how did you know different sizes would...?  Ah, of
course.  You must have heard Albrecht talking to someone about how I
said that I could have used the same technique to make bigger
explosions and you figured it could scale down, too.  That's why you
specified 'enough to destroy a twenty foot radius' instead of 'twenty
nanograms' or whatever it would be."  I nodded again, impressed.
"Slick.  Very slick."
</p>

<p>
The curtsey she dropped me was only very slightly ironic, and she
looked genuinely pleased&mdash;at least, if the blush and the smile
still meant anything.  My meek and mousey little Suze had just
revealed an inner tigress that was requiring some adjustments.  Still,
that smile could still light up a room, and it was good to see.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, one last thing that I can't figure out," I said.  "How is it that
the Icefis didn't see all this in your head when they Mindscraped us
in the Receiving Room?  Or did they?  I mean, I know that we figured
they would 'Scrape us and see that we only intended to help Afi, but
you were keeping secrets from the rest of us.  How did you know they
wouldn't spill them?"
</p>

<p>
She shrugged, a secretive smile tugging at the corners of her lips.
"I used Programmed Amnesia on myself to hide all of those memories.
Their Disjunction spells negated the Amnesia and I got the memories
back, but that was after they had Mindscraped us.  If they hadn't, I
would have gotten them back as soon as we saw Death."
</p>

<p>
I grinned.  "It's ok, you can say Neklos now.  He's not going to be
doing anything for a long, loooong time.  Neklos! Neklos! Neklos!
Neklos is a poopyhead!  See?"
</p>

<p>
<strong>"Ahem,"</strong> said the voice of the God of War who was
suddenly standing right behind me.  <strong>"That's my brother you're
talking about."</strong>
</p>

<p>
So, here's the thing...standing in the middle of a ring of forty or
fifty gods, all of whom are in full regalia, thirty feet tall, and
lsooking pissed?  Yeah, kinda scary.

<p>
<em>The blurb for "One Hot Night" is:</em>
</p>
<p>
"In a society without death, Ingfred is 20 years old and has no
prospects. All the good jobs are filled by undying masters of their
craft, and it's hard to be taken seriously when you are, compared to
everyone around you, an infant.  Fortunately, he has a solution:
undergo an illegal transformation and sell the memory to The
Experiental Herald for a ridiculous sum.
</p>

<p>
There's two problems: how can Ingfred convince a powerful wizard to
risk his mage license and his freedom to help with such a crazy plan?
And, once that's done...how will Ingfred deal with the law?"
</p>
