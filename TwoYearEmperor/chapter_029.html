"My priorities are to get rid of the people who mucked with my brain
and all of their families, keep Flobovia safe, and make sure that all
of her people get access to your life extension technology&mdash;er,
magic.
</p>

<p>
"My problems are the fact that the Archmagi and the Landguard don't
want to be killed, the Landguard won't let me surrender on the terms
that you previously offered, there's a lovely little civil war brewing
up between my police force and every arcane caster in Flobovia,
another one brewing between me personally and two thirds of the people
in Flobovia because the Archpriest hates my guts and, oh by the way,
he <em>really</em> doesn't want you making his people immortal."
</p>

<p>
I paused to breathe.  Albrecht leaned back in his chair, looking
thoughtful and picking at his fruit compote.
</p>

<p>
"Sounds like you've had a busy week," he offered, nibbling a grape.
</p>

<p>
I made a moue.  "You have <em>no idea,</em>" I muttered,
exasperated.  <em>~Seriously, all I want is to be left alone so I can
butcher a few thousand of my enemies.  Is that <strong>really</strong>
so much to ask?~</em>
</p>

<p>
"Anyway, here's my thought.  The Landguard's objection is that you
want to take all of the Flobovian military out of the country and let
them get killed fighting undead.  Now&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht interrupted, frowning thunderously.  "Of <em>course</em> we
wouldn't let them die!  That's the whole point!  <em>We</em> aren't
the ones who let our populace be killed off by ridiculous things like
disease and old age, that's you and your irresponsible cohorts!"
</p>

<p>
I raised my hands placatingly.  "Hey, hey, relax.  You're preaching to
the choir here.  I don't think death should be allowed either, but
they haven't quite gotten past that whole 'getting wrinkly and sick
and weak and then ceasing to exist is normal and therefore good!'
foolishness.  Honestly, it's ridiculous&mdash;by that argument they
should never have touched that whole newfangled 'fire' business."  I
shook my head in disgust at the hypocrisy.  At the same time,
something pinged in the back of my head; there was something odd about
the way Albrecht had said that. I'd recently become highly attuned to
noticing that sense of wrongness, but I didn't have time to think
about it just now.  Instead I filed it away for future consideration
and turned my focus back to the conversation.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht snorted and smiled slightly, his irritation allayed.  He
poured himself some more tea and again offered the pot.  This time I
took him up on it and spent a moment savoring the luscious, smoky
flavor&mdash;it tasted like the smell of rich forest loam after a
spring rain, earthy and clean and vibrant, with just the faintest
trace of bitter to give it some kick.  I smiled and sighed, feeling my
shoulders relaxing as I let the aromatics roll around on my tongue.
</p>

<p>
"Allow me to rephrase," I told him. "The Landguard will not let me
surrender on your previously stated terms because you said that you
were going to take all the Flobovian military and deploy them against
the drauga.  Right?"
</p>

<p>
He nodded.  "Yes, we find that the best way to rapidly integrate a new
people into the Union is to exchange their combatants with ours.  We
capture the hearts of their troops by integrating them with the
Legions where they form friendships and war-brother bonds.  We capture
the hearts of the civilians by enforcing strict discipline among the
troops that guard them; we actually punish our troops more harshly for
any given crime than we would punish a civilian for that crime.
Pretty soon the civilians come to look at our troops as protectors and
accept them.  From there it doesn't take long before we start seeing
troops and civilians getting married&mdash;in fact, we make it a point
to post mostly unmarried troops to pacification assignments."
</p>

<p>
He paused and gave a slightly wavery smile, his eyes unfocussing as he
looked off at a memory.  "Pacification posts are considered plum
assignments.  You're pretty much guaranteed a bed, steady meals, and
no undead horrors trying to eat your face.  There's even a term for
it&mdash;the troops call them 'sing and ring' assignments, because you
sing with joy when you get them and there's a good chance that you'll
end up with a wife.  Our troops treat the townsfolk like holy
treasures because the standard disciplinary action is to ship
troublemakers back to the front and put someone else in their place."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht shrugged, the smile fading and his eyes coming back to the
present.  "Anyway, it typically doesn't take more than a decade or
two, sometimes a lot less, before the citizens of a new member state
stop thinking of themselves as 'whatever-ians' and start thinking of
themselves as 'Anundj&aring;ns'."
</p>

<p>
I pondered that for a moment.  "So, it's basically like ancient China.
Invaders swept over them again and again, and after a few generations
of interbreeding and integrating, the invaders were just more
Chinese."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht cocked his head a little, considering that, then shrugged.
"Something like that.  Our definition of 'generation' is a little
different than yours, of course.  Typically, integration starts to get
under way after about five years and after twenty or thirty it's
pretty much done.  After a century there's almost never an issue left,
which is why we typically award full membership at that point.  At
that point it's safe to return the native troops from the front and to
hand governance back to the locals. As a matter of policy we make sure
that regional governors are not from the province that they
govern&mdash;it prevents charges of favoritism.  And when a state is
given full membership we can't pull all their troops back immediately,
of course, but we can at least give them home leave.  Inasmuch as we
can give any soldier home leave, of course.  The demands of the war
take precedence."
</p>

<p>
I nodded, more focused on my previously planned speech than on what
Albrecht was saying.  "Sure, seems reasonable.  But here's the thing:
the Landguard's oath to protect the Land&mdash;meaning the common
citizens&mdash;means that they can't let you take Joe Random Militia
Guy off to the war.  And therefore they can't let <em>me</em>
surrender under the terms you gave earlier."  I paused for a moment,
wanting to hear his reaction.  How much room did we have for
negotiation here?
</p>

<p>
Albrecht frowned.  "Exchange of troops is a core element of the
Integration Act.  I don't have the authority to promise that none of
your troops will be transferred away.  And if I did have the
authority, I still wouldn't make that promise.  We need troops at the
front and we need for Flobovia to <em>not</em> rebel as soon as we
turn our backs.  I suppose that I could stretch the rules a bit and
rule that militia aren't actually a military force and therefore won't
be drafted.  But any full-time troops will have to go to the Legions."
</p>

<p>
I smiled.  "Let's leave the Landguard for a moment; we'll get back to
them.  There's two issues that are keeping me from being able to
surrender which, frankly, I really want to do.  The first is the
Landguard issue and the second is the religion issue.  The Archpriest
is going to hit the roof if Anundj&aring;n missionaries show up, set
up shop in all of the cities, and push his church into the background.
But!...what if that didn't happen?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht looked puzzled for a moment and then his eyes widened and he
started laughing.  He laughed so hard he had to gasp for breath and
wipe his eyes before he could talk again.  "Oh, that's
just <em>evil</em>.  I love it.  So the High Church sends missionaries
over, but we build the temples, schools, and hospitals outside the
cities&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I was nodding furiously, leaning in with a huge smile.  "&mdash;where
he's got no right to say anything.  Legally, Flobovia has religious
freedom.  As long as you don't claim that the so-called 'True Church'
is false or abusive&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;then we are legally just one of the minor churches and he
can't object to our presence.  He'll preach against us, but since we
offer youth and life&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;then people will be coming to you no matter what he says.  A
trickle at first, just to see if the rumors are real, but later it'll
be a flood&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;and the more he preaches against us, the more curious people
will get, and the more of them will come for rejuv.  Some people may
want to die and go on to the afterlife but most will want to spend a
little more time with their grandkids, see their next kid get born,
their son complete his journeyman test, finish bringing in the crops,
and so on."
</p>

<p>
I was nodding furiously and grinning like a fool.  "There'll always be
a reason to stay alive just a little bit longer.  In a couple of
decades all the ones who want to die will have died&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;and the kids in the next generation will have grown up with
the idea of eternal youth and life and it won't even occur to them
that they should die.  I love it!"
</p>

<p>
We grinned at each other like a pair of kids who had just plundered
the cookie jar of every last crumb without getting caught.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht was the first one to pull back to practical matters.  "What
about the Landguard though?  I really can't do anything about the
troops, they need to be inducted to the Legions."
</p>

<p>
The look on my face was positively a leer.  "Well, first of all, the
Landguard have three duties.  They serve the Land, the Law, and the
ruler, <em>in that order.</em>  I doubt that there's anything in the
Writ that relates to this situation, but I'll check.  That leaves the
Land and the ruler.  Taking those out of order, they will feel an
obligation to protect me.  So, we make it a condition of the surrender
that I go to Anundj&aring; and they'll therefore have to go with
me."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht nodded thoughtfully.  "Yes, I can work with that.  We can
find you a job as a strategist; that will allow them to stick close to
you but still be attached to the Legions as foreign auxiliares, some
of whom happen to never be tasked to front line duty.  That will
satisfy the letter of the law, if not the spirit.  I assume they
won't <em>all</em> need to be glued to your elbow, right?  Given they
can fight, heal, and turn undead they are too valuable for us to leave
them completely fallow."
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.  "No, they'll be able to put a detail on me and send
the rest out.  Probably a pretty heavy detail since I'll be in a war
zone and surrounded by people who were recently trying to kill me, but
I'd imagine that I could loan you at very least a thousand of them,
probably fifteen hundred, as well as a couple of our Archmagi...say,
Reynard and Matthew?  And if it just so happened that they all ended
up unrecoverably dead in a heroic battle somewhere...well, I wouldn't
cry over it."
</p>

<p>
He nodded slightly, taking my meaning: killing off the Landguard and the
Archmagi was part of the deal.  "What about their service to the Land,
though?  That's the primary thing keeping them from allowing the
surrender in the first place."
</p>

<p>
I snickered slightly.  "Well, the wording of that is very specific.
They must protect the Land, meaning the common citizens of Flobovia,
so they can't allow those citizens to be drafted into a foreign army
and sent off to fight hordes of undead.  But, interesting thing: 'The
Land' refers to the <em>common</em> citizens of Flobovia.  It doesn't
cover the Landguard themselves, or the nobles.  And as it happens, the
ruler has the power to ennoble anyone he wants to."
</p>

<p>
I suspect that Albrecht's peals of laughter were clearly audible back
in Capital City.
