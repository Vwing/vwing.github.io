<p>
"I'm thinking we set up a railgun to throw all those books into the
ritual fires," I said.  "Then we disassemble the shelves and use the
room as a staging ground.  What do the rest of you say?"
</p>

<p>
No one said a single word.
</p>  

<p>
They just stared at me.
</p>

<p>
In total silence.
</p>

<p>
"Are you crazy?" Albrecht asked in a friendly voice.
</p>

<p>
I blinked in surprise.  "Um...no?"
</p>

<p>
"You want to take all the books that were given to us by
a <em>god,</em>" he said.  "Given to us, specifically,
by <em>Loki</em>, who is pretty much the definition of unpredictable.
You want to take all these books and <em>burn them?</em>  As a
sacrifice to another god?"
</p>

<p>
"It's...not an entirely bad idea," Thomas said slowly.  "From what we
know, the sacrifices have a direct influence on who Herr&uacute;n will
pay attention to, and what she will be like when she reforms.  Right
now we're looking at a goddess of secrets who will be primarily
influenced by evil ice clones of a master lich.  We need to not just
catch up, but enormously surpass them, dilute their influence.  I
don't see how we're going to accomplish that without effectively
lobotomizing most of our population."
</p>

<p>
"We can create Ice Assassins of our own," Drifa suggested.  "We have
plenty of high level casters now.  Assuming that people haven't used
up their ninth level slots today, we could spit out a couple hundred
thousand of them right now."
</p>

<p>
"It would take a few hours," Colborn pointed out with a fangy frown.
"Most people won't have it prepared, so they'd need to
sleep&mdash;only for an hour, given the Bedrolls, but still.  After
that they'd need to take another hour to prepare spells.  And we'd
need to take some time getting the word around in the first place."
</p>

<p>
"That wouldn't take long, with the railguns," Drifa responded.  "And,
come to think of it, we can use Simulacrum as well.  That's only
seventh level; we can spam a lot more of them."  
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.  "Arros only let the Landguard use multiple Ice
Assassins because they were limited to two thousand members and it
amused him," I pointed out.  "I doubt he'd let us create hundreds of
thousands of duplicates just because it would be fair to let us do the
same thing that the other side did.  Anyway, it won't matter.  Right
now the gating factor is how many people can physically go in and out
of Gr&#491;fhamr and past the altars in a single round.  Adding more
people to the mix doesn't help."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be an idiot," Allison snapped.  "Just have them fly like you
said the Icefis were doing.  That'll let you match the number of
sacrifices they were making.  Dumbass."
</p>

<p>
I darted an annoyed glance at the snarky elemental, but made an effort
to consider her suggestion on its merits.  "Hm," I mused, visualizing
the spatial relations.  "Could do, although even then there's only so
many people who can fit at a time, so unlimited copies doesn't help."
I eyed the key to Loki's library thoughtfully, twisting it in my hand
so the light glinted weakly on the dull brass.  "Also, like Thomas
said, it's not enough to <em>equal</em> the number of sacrifices they
made, we have to <em>enormously surpass</em> them.  Like, by an order
of magnitude or two."
</p>

<p>
"Well, fine, it's still something," she grumbled.
</p>

<p>
"We don't even know what's in those books," Albrecht said calmly.
"What if they contain basic information like how to eat?  Or language?
Whoever sacrifices them loses all that knowledge; they could end up a
drooling vegetable."
</p>

<p>
I shrugged.  "So we have an Ice Assassin do it.  Who cares how it ends
up?  We can always make more."
</p>

<p>
Isaac looked to be in physical pain&mdash;or heavily constipated, I
wasn't sure.  "You are seriously considering burning thousands,
perhaps millions, of books without even trying to read them?" he
demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Hey, I <em>tried</em> to read them!" I yelped.  "You saw&mdash;the
text is too small to read, and even if they weren't, Loki told us how
they're too wordy to be useful!"
</p>

<p>
"Cough, cough," Loki said, lounging on his oversized canary perch.
</p>

<p>
I groaned and banged my head on the table lightly.  "Look,
we <em>can't read the damn things</em>!" I told the Trickster.  "You
did that deliberately!  But you gave them to us, we should be able to
do whatever we like with them, right?  And we <em>really</em> need to
catch up with the Icefis on sacrifices."
</p>

<p>
Loki swung back and forth on his perch, lips pursed in thought.  "Not
sure how much I like this idea," he said.  He swung a bit more.  "In
fact, not so keen on it," he decided.
</p>

<p>
"We really need this," I told him, injecting as much sincerity as I
could into my voice.  "Look, all of you, think about it," I said,
turning to the others.  "Did you see what it looks like out there?
The Icefis over-sacrificed the <em>hell</em> out of us.  Are our
sacrifices even one percent of what's out there?...it sure didn't look
like it to me.  I have no idea how six or seven hundred of those
things got that many sacrifices off in twenty four hours, but they
did.  We really want to be able to complete the ritual before we go
talk to Death; if things go sideways, having another god on our side
is pretty much the only thing that even gives us the vaguest hint of a
chance."  I flicked a sideways glance at Loki.  "And, no offense, but
I don't think you're the one we should be counting on for that."
</p>

<p>
He snickered; his perch vanished mid-swing and he plumped down onto a
pile of pillows the size of thimbles.  Fortunately, he was only an
inch high when he hit.  
</p>

<p>
"Nope," he squeaked.  "You got that right.  I am <em>so</em> not your
guy in a standup fight.  Which, by the way, would be seriously stupid.
I mean, you're talking about the god of Death...if you plan to kill
him, his portfolio sense would tell him about it months ahead of you
even thinking of it."
</p>

<p>
"On that subject," Thomas asked suspiciously.  "You said that you
weren't planning to harm Melvin, but that you needed to be able to act
before Death.  That sounds an awful lot like combat planning to me,
and Death will be manifesting through Melvin."
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.  "I promise.  Not going to do anything at all to
Melvin except tell him how to get away from the shard.  Also, not
going to try to kill or even hurt Death."  
</p>

<p>
Thomas gave me a squinty look.  "You know that gods aren't affected by
Imprisonment, Temporal Stasis, Polymorph effects, or anything like
that, right?  You can't just trap him."
</p>

<p>
Again I shook my head.  "I promise, not going to cast a single spell
on him.  Scout's honor."  I gave him a three-fingered salute to show
my honesty.
</p>

<p>
He gave me another sour look, but eventually he let it go.  "Every
scout <em>I've</em> ever known was a treacherous bastard," he muttered
as he refilled his winecup.
</p>

<p>
"Going back to an earlier topic," Albrecht said.  "Jake's right about
one thing; we are ridiculously far behind the Icefis.  If we want to
complete the ritual before dawn the day after tomorrow&mdash;and I
really think we do&mdash;then we need to seriously pump up our rate of
sacrificing."  He dipped his finger in a puddle of spilled wine and
started sketching numbers on the table in front of him.  "When I
checked earlier, we had pushed about fifty thousand people through the
FLEA.  Each of them is a 20th level wizard with enhanced Intelligence,
so they can cast an absolute minimum of five Ice Assassins per day.
They're also 20th level sorcerors; depending on what ninth level
spells they chose as sorcerors and what their base Charisma was, they
might be able to cast six or seven more Ice Assassins from that side.
Let's assume that we can get an average of eight Assassins from each
caster, that means we could theoretically put out four hundred
thousand Ice Assassins per day, just with our existing caster
resources.  More casters are coming online every round, so maybe we
can just muscle our way through this."
</p>

<p>
Loki expanded back to full size and snorted.  "Not a chance.  Jake
called it; after the last time we all scuffled, armies of Ice
Assassins and Simulacrums have been banned.  Afi was grandfathered in,
but he hasn't been allowed to make more since then."
</p>

<p>
Thomas raised an eyebrow at that.  "What about when Arros allowed us
to repopulate the Landguard ranks with Ice Assassins?  Shouldn't that
have been against the Edict?"
</p>

<p>
Loki shrugged. "Unusual circumstances.  You're not creating a new
army, you're repopulating an existing one.  Ordinarily you could do
that by way of Resurrection, but Death is playing silly buggers with
that right now&mdash;which is against the rules&mdash;so there's a
little more leeway.  Once bringing friends back is working again, you
won't be allowed to hang on to the Iceys." He raised a finger in
caution.  "Oh, and I wouldn't count on being able to make new ones if
the existing ones get blowed up.  My guess is that, even though Arros
ok'd this group, one of the others will object if you try to turn it
into an infinitely renewable resource."
</p>

<p>
I cocked a head as something early on in that caught my attention.
"'The last time you all scuffled.'  Yeah, what is it with you guys and
your scuffles?  You do this every few thousand years and each time the
world ends because of it...but you depend on the people for worship,
so why do you do it?"
</p>

<p>
Loki put his feet up on the table, legs crossed casually at the
ankles.  He shot the collar on his trenchcoat, pulled his brown fedora
low over his eyes and gave the brim a quick flick to make sure the nap
lay smooth.
</p>

<p>
"The city was dark that night," he gritted in a perfect Dashiell
Hammett growl.  "Dark and covered in filth; the rain slid down the
sewers like blood oozing from a wound.  Blood and wounds...we had 'em
in piles.  The Kid had just come to town, and he was sending a
message.  The message was written in pain and death across the
brightly lit halls of civil power and the dark and smokey backrooms of
criminal might.  It was a blunt and simple thing: 'This is mine now;
come for me if you've got the stones.'"
</p>

<p>
He paused, tossed back his whiskey, then held the glass up to the
light and studied it as though it contained the secrets of the
universe.  "The movers and shakers...they had the stones," he said
thoughtfully.  "War stalked the streets, and the regular people
huddled in their beds like children hiding from the closet monster.
The Kid was smart.  Smart, and ruthless.  He crushed the small bosses
first, took their turf and used the money and the power to grab the
strings on some of the bigwigs in City Hall.  The bigwigs and the
bosses, they came together to crush him, but the Kid was slick.  He
called in all his allies and went to the mattresses. He held his
turf&mdash;even grew it some."
</p>

<p>
Another dramatic pause, another tossed-off shot of liquid amber.  "The
war washed back and forth like a tide of blood," Loki ground out in a
voice world-weary enough to earn sympathy from Job.  "It left high
water marks halfway up the highest towers, a red tide that ripped
families apart in every neighborhood.  The city itself was being
shaken to its foundations, buildings falling into the Bay like drunks
into the gutter.  Eventually, the bosses and the bigwigs came to the
table; they gave the Kid his turf, set up rules they could all live
by.  Everyone backed off, hands on their gats and murder in their
hearts.  Quiet came to the city on the Bay...the same quiet that fills
up a prison yard when the new meat walks over to challenge the
shotcaller's goon."
</p>

<p>
The glass was placed, very precisely, on the table; the right
hand&mdash;knuckles calloused from many a brawl and fingertips stained
from many a smoke&mdash;dipped into the pocket of the trenchcoat,
bringing out a snub-nosed revolver and a polishing cloth.  The hands
moved almost of their own volition, cleaning any dust or grit off the
serviceable old weapon.
</p>

"The peace lasted...for a while," Loki continued, still in that
hardboiled growl.  "Things were tense: little dustups down in the
Sprawl, the occasional throw-down over on the docks.  Like they always
do, the bosses and the bigwigs jockeyed for power, pushing at each
other, always looking for weakness.  Eventually, the Kid figured his
position was strong enough; he started moving against the other bosses
again.  He was real subtle this time; nothing out in the open, never
the closed fist.  No, it was the open hand this time; he went to the
people.  He told them that the other bosses couldn't really provide
protection, that they had no power...that they were just paper tigers.
Like I said, shweetheart, he was slick, see?  He knew just what to
say; pretty soon, a lot of folks were eating out of his hand.  They
weren't paying protection to the other bosses anymore, weren't going
to the brothels that poured money into the other bosses' piggybanks.
Instead, they were moving to the Kid's turf in ones and twos, little
trickles that were growing into streams, poised to turn into a river
and soon into a flood.
</p>

<p>
"The bosses saw what was coming and sent for their goon squads.  They
reached out to the bigwigs, but just got the cold shoulder.  As far as
the bigwigs were concerned, this was a matter for the darker side of
the street and had nothing to do with what went on in the light."  He
snorted.  "That didn't last long.  Pretty soon the fighting was bad;
people were dying left and right.  The Kid and his people had carved
off a big chunk of the docks and were using it to choke the life outta
the city.  The bigwigs had to choose sides.  It was late in the game,
though; they were a day late, a dollar short, and two steps behind the
music.  There was no more room for subtle, no room for the open hand.
They pulled out the brass nucks and went in swinging; the blood washed
up to stain the towers again."
</p>

<p>
He rose to his feet, head coming up slowly so he could sweep his gaze
over all of us.  "That's where I come in," he gritted.  "Who am I?
I'm the guy that keeps things together.  The name's Loki Odinson;
conjure by it at your own risk.  If you need help, call me; I'm in the
book."
</p>

<p>
He went silent, staring us all down for another long moment.  No one
moved.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly his so-serious face split in an ear-to-ear grin.  "Ta-da!" he
cried, tossing his fedora into the air with a showy snap of the wrist.
(It vanished just before touching the ceiling.)  "Thank you, thank
you!  This has been a reading of my new book, <em>City of Angels, City
of Death</em>, coming in November.  Signed copies are available."  He
pulled a stack of a dozen fat hardcover books from inside his paisley
vest and plonked them down on the table, making it jump.  "Thank you,
thank you, you've been a lovely audience."
</p>

<p>
He turned to face me, taking a sip of his fresh squeezed orange juice
and then giving me a smile from behind teeth so white as to be
blinding.  "Anyway, where were we...?  Ah, yes, you were asking why
the gods have our little spats every few thousand years.  Simple:
we're just like any other big, highly disfunctional, immortal,
nigh-omnipotent family forced to live in close proximity: everyone is
sick of everyone else and would love to see them fall down the
stairs&mdash;or at least into the pool.  Occasionally we just need to
give each other a push."  He paused for another sip of his juice, then
gave the shrug that you give when you're about to admit something
embarrassing.  "Also, it's about gaining power.  Usually, when we're
all jockeying back and forth, it's not a big deal.  But, sometimes
someone starts doing too well at someone else's expense and the
someone else takes a swing.  And then the someone calls in all his
buddies and swings back, and pretty soon everyone is doing it."
</p>

<p>
I stopped to digest that.  "Ohkaayyy," I began slowly.  "Fine.  So,
it's just ladder-climbing that makes you destroy the world.  Good
enough."  I shook my head in pained disbelief at the level of
callousness being displayed, then forced myself to go back to the main
issue.  "Speaking of ladder-climbing, we still need to talk about
those books."
</p>

<p>
Loki sprawled back on his Barcalounger; the footrest was up but he was
sitting sideways in the chair so his legs dangled over the arm.  "What
about 'em?" he asked artlessly.
</p>

<p>
"You know what," I scolded him.  "We want to sacrifice them so that we
can catch up to and pass the Icefis.  If we aren't allowed to create
giant rivers of Ice Assassins, I don't see how we can do that in any
reasonable time period <em>except</em> to sac the books.  We sure
can't catch up by the day after tomorrow, when we need it to be
finished."
</p>

<p>
He pulled a long face.  "Look, I'm really not comfortable with this,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
Suze leaned forward to whisper in my ear.  "Bribe him, M'Lord," she
told me.
</p>

<p>
Loki chuckled.  "I appreciate the discretion, young lady, but...well,
divine hearing, y'know?"
</p>

<p>
Suze eeped, blushed brick red from her top to her toes, and hunched up
so much I thought she was going to vanish from sight.
</p>

<p>
"Still...," Loki said thoughtfully.  "Having to answer these questions
really does tick me off, and it's not like you're doing anything with
the books.  I guess it doesn't really cost me very much.  Hm."  He
tipped his head back and forth, obviously weighing up the pros and the
cons.  After a moment he seemed to reach a conclusion.  "Ok, tell you
what.  You forfeit all the remaining questions I owe you and you can
burn the books."
</p>

<p>
"Ok, that sounds fai&mdash;" I began gratefully.
</p>

<p>
"That's a very kind offer, Lord Loki," Drifa said, talking right over
me.  "It seems rather expensive, though, don't you think?  One
question seems much more fair to me."
</p>

<p>
I opened my mouth to protest, then closed it again.  Negotiation was
not my strong suit; let someone else do it.
</p>

<p>
Loki chuckled.  "Yeah, that's a lovely thought but no.  Tell you what,
though&mdash;I admire your spunk, so I'll give a little.  You can keep
one of the 'honest but maybe deceptive' questions.  How's that?"
</p>

<p>
"Ridiculous, that's how it is," Drifa said with a gleeful scowl.
(Yes, I know that's a weird combination&mdash;it's what she looked
like, I swear.  I guess the woman really enjoyed haggling.)  "It would
be much more fair to&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Over the next fifteen minutes I got to watch a virtuoso display of
skill and theatre.  Seriously, it was riveting.  I don't know where
Drifa grew up, but apparently someone had given her lessons in
pinching pennies until they screamed.  The offers flew thick and fast;
after one minute, Loki was sitting upright, his 'lounger replaced by
an Aeron office chair.  Three minutes after that, he had teleported
the chair and himself over to where Drifa was sitting and crammed in
with her, practically knee-to-knee as the haggling gathered speed.
Despite words of contempt, dismissive laughs, and the occasional
threat of physical violence, the two of them seemed to be having a
grand old time and it was keeping the attention off of me, so I sat
quietly and let it happen.
</p>

<p>
Of course, Loki isn't called 'Silvertongue' and 'Liesmith' for
nothing.  By the time the terms were finally agreed to and the
armistice officially signed, he had gotten Drifa to give up four of
the 'honest and complete' questions and two of the 'honest but maybe
deceptive' questions.  Eventually, when both realized that neither one
was going to move any further, they turned to me to ratify the treaty.
Their stares were equally intense; it made me feel like a mouse about
to be pounced on by two tigers.  I forced myself to stay calm and not
hide behind Thomas.
</p>

<p>
"Sounds like a deal," I told them both, smiling nervously.  "So.  Just
to confirm: it's cool for us to start the book burning, right?"
</p>

<p>
Loki pulled a sad face but nodded.  "Yep.  Go ahead."  He sighed.
"Man, I hate to see 'em go."
</p>

<p>
I nodded to Thomas and he dispatched a smoke sparrow to Sergeant
Thorn.  While he was at it, he pulled up another sparrow...but he
paused before sending it.
</p>

<p>
"Lord Loki," Thomas asked politely.  "We had intended to make multiple
Ice Assassins of Sergeant Duncan in order to train the new troops.  Is
that a problem?"
</p>

<p>
Loki shook his head.  "Any caster can only have one Ice Assassin out
at any time, but there's no limit on how many you can make of a given
person.  Go for it."  One eyebrow went up and he grinned sardonically.
"Note, however&mdash;there's a difference between using Ice Assassins
to kill people, which is what they're intended for, and using them for
day labor.  I wouldn't try having all of your casters pop an Ice
Assassin for general work, but a hundred should be safe.  I doubt even
Ilara would object to that."
</p>

<p>
My lips pursed in frustrated irritation.  These damn rules were just
so freaking <em>arbitrary!</em>  I almost wouldn't mind if they were
clear-cut&mdash;"thou shalt not make Ice Assassins", for
example&mdash;but instead they seemed to practically be up to the
discretion of each individual god.
</p>

<p>
"Well, soonest begun soonest done," Loki said with a regretful sigh.
He waved a hand and suddenly we were all standing outdoors beside the
northernmost altar.  He looked significantly at me.  "Well?  Open 'er
up."
</p>

<p>
Feeling more self-conscious than at any other time in my life, I
pulled out the key, inserted it into thin air, and turned.  The wooden
door appeared in front of me, its lock opening with a
muffled <em>click</em>.  I twisted the knob and pushed the door open,
watching as the fluorescents flickered on, lighting up the immense
room with a soft buzz.
</p>

<p>
Loki sighed behind me, waving a hand at the library with a sweeping,
overly dramatic gesture.  "Goodbye, sweet tomes.  We hardly knew
thee."  He sighed again, hamming up his sadness at the loss that was
about to occur.
</p>

<p>
For myself, I just stared down the rows for a minute, soberly
contemplating what I was about to do.  I was a bibliophile of the
first order; atheist I might be, but burning books was one of the few
things I considered a true and mortal and nigh-unforgiveable sin.
Still, this was a survival situation, so needs must.
</p>

<p>
A quiet cough behind me jolted me out of my contemplation; startled, I
stepped back so that a dark haired woman could move through the
door...followed by a pimple-faced teenager...followed by a dang
legion of other random people coming through one of the Teleportation
Circle blankets that Thomas had spread on the ground behind me.
Clearly, the Commander had been busy while I'd been woolgathering.
</p>

<p>
By now, the Gr&#491;fhamrites had had enough practice setting up
railguns that it was down to a science.  They went down the first
aisle fast, picking up books and railgunning them out to the altar as
they went.  Others started fanning out down the adjacent aisles,
sending books back up their own lines.  The guy in the door was a
bottleneck, but they solved that one easily enough; they set up five
lines outside the door and five inside.  Books coming down the center
line were simply railgunned straight out.  Books coming in from the
left or right lines were tossed crosswise over the doorman's head, to
be caught by the person heading one of the exterior lines.  All the
books were passed rapidly back to the altar and shoveled in like coal
into a firebox.  The people at the ends of the lines looked no
different from anyone else, but I assumed they were actually Ice
Assassins tasked to the job by their creators.
</p>

<p>
I winced a little; we were <em>burning books</em>, converting giant
tomes of knowledge into so much smoke and flashes of silvery light.
Not only that, but we were probably going to end up lobotomizing these
Ice Assassins...they might be magical constructs, but they were still
sentient.  Despite my earlier casualness, this bothered me a lot; if
it wasn't evil, it was as close as I'd ever come when I wasn't
magically psycho.
</p>

<p>
Still, it was making a difference.  There was a tsunami of stars
flying up from the altars; so many and so fast that their light was
washing out that of the black stars.  The black stars had a huge head
start in terms of numbers, but the rate at which they were appearing
made it clear that the silver stars would outnumber the black within
hours.  Within a day, they would entirely dominate.
</p>

<p>
A collective sigh of relief went around the group.  <em>~We did
it,~</em> I thought, with a tired pleasure. <em>~Afi and his little
ice minions won't be the major part of Herr&uacute;n.  She'll mostly
answer to us.  Thank god.~</em>
</p>

<p>
I eyed the book-burning lines for a moment, then sighed and gathered
myself up.  "Come on, everyone.  Work's not done yet.  We should keep
up the pressure on the other Lich Kings; let's go talk to Hammond and
see what we can find out about that."  I started to turn away, then
paused as the door slid along with me.
</p>

<p>
"Um...Loki?" I asked, turning back to him.  "I don't suppose you could
let me leave this behind, could you?" I asked, gesturing at the door
that was effectively glued to my butt.
</p>

<p>
When I turned back he had been frowning and rubbing his temples, but
at my question he laughed and waved his hand in another of those
overly dramatic gestures.  "There you go.  It'll stay here until you
come back and close it.  After that, it's back to staying with you."
</p>

<p>
I nodded my thanks and turned away again.  It was late, we were all
tired and food-coma-y after the luxurious dinner, but there was still
work to do.  With reluctant determination, we shouldered our
metaphorical load and went back inside to resume planning the war.

"In a society without death, Ingfred is 20 years old and has no

craft, and it's hard to be taken seriously when you are, compared to
everyone around you, an infant.  Fortunately, he has a solution:
