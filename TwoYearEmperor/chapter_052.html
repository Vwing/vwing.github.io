<p>
<em><strong>Author's Note</strong>: Loki has informed me that he owns
D&D.  I certainly don't, but I wouldn't put too much faith in him; he
is the God of Lies, after all.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em><strong>Important:</strong> I am on the other side of the
International Dateline from now until the end of September 2014.  As
such, you may find updates happening on a different day&mdash;they
will still be happening on Saturday, but it will be Saturday in my
current timezone.</em>
</p>

<hr />

<p>
"What did you <em>do?!</em>" cried Albrecht.  "He was
our <em>friend!</em>"
</p>

<p>
"No.  He wasn't."  Thomas's voice was cold and flat as iron. "He was a
lich.  <em>The</em> lich.  The head of the creatures that destroyed
your nation and killed eighty percent of the Landguard."
</p>

<p>
He pivoted to face Duncan.  "Sergeant Duncan!  State your feelings for
Afi as of ten minutes ago!"
</p>

<p>
Duncan braced to a bootcamp attention, eyes locked on the wall in
front of him.  "Sir!  Ten minutes ago I regarded Afi as a major threat
to the Land, sir!"
</p>

<p>
Thomas gave a millimetric nod.  "State your feelings for Afi as of
now!"
</p>

<p>
If it were possible, Duncan's brace got even stiffer.  "Sir!  I have
recognized that my negative feelings for Afi were in error, that Afi
is a dear friend, as close as any of my companions in the Landguard,
sir!"
</p>

<p>
"Does this represent a significant change in your attitude, Sergeant
Duncan?" Thomas snapped.
</p>

<p>
Duncan nodded perfunctorily.  "Sir, yes sir!"
</p>

<p>
"What is standard Landguard policy regarding significant changes in
attitude, Sergeant Duncan?" Thomas demanded. 
</p>

<p>
"Sir!  When a Landguard experiences a very rapid and significant
change in attitude towards any being, it shall be assumed that said
change is of a magical nature and constitutes a real and imminent
threat to the ruler and/or the Land, sir!"  I could see a bead of
sweat running slowly down Duncan's leathery face.
</p>

<p>
"What is the appropriate reaction to a real and imminent threat to our
ruler, Sergeant Duncan?" Thomas challenged him.
</p>

<p>
"Sir!  Capture or kill, sir!" Duncan returned.
</p>

<p>
"You had your weapons in hand, within arms reach of the threat, and
you failed to neutralize the threat," Thomas declared flatly.  "You
have failed in your duty to the ruler and to the Land.  You will stand
down and report to Sergeant Thorn for punishment duty.  You are to
give him a full report on the nature of your failure.  You will be on
punishment duty sixteen hours per day until I say otherwise.  You will
spend another seven hours per day cleaning water for the inhabitants
of Gr&#491;fhamr, who were significantly endangered by your failure.
Get out of my sight."
</p>

<p>
Duncan face was a mask that almost managed to cover up the jagged pain
that was tearing him open.  He gave a crisp nod and doubletimed out of
the room.
</p>

<p>
For a long moment, Thomas surveyed the rest of us with an expression
like the personification of Death.  Finally, he snapped his blades to
the side, flicking blood (and the skull) off their polished steel.
The blood sluiced off as if the swords were frictionless (which, for
all I knew, they might be).  Thomas clashed their now-shining-clean
lengths into their sheathes and walked over to where the overturned
table rested against the far wall.  Hoisting the heavy oaken thing
with no more effort than I would use for a quilt, he flipped it over
and dropped it back in place before taking his seat.
</p>

<p>
"Do we have a problem?" he inquired, in a voice that promised painful
death to anyone who gave the wrong answer.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht, Drifa, and Unn slowly&mdash;and shakily&mdash;stood up from
where they had been slammed to the floor by Thomas's earlier
table-kick.  Clearly needing to buy themselves a moment, they brushed
themselves off and gathered up the papers and water mugs that had been
spilled when the table was upset. (Fortunately, the mugs were made of
wood, so they hadn't broken when they hit the floor.  The silver water
pitcher, on the other hand, had been caught under the edge of the
table and crumpled like tinfoil.)  They restored everything to its
place, then righted their chairs and took their places around the
table again.
</p>

<p>
"I repeat," Thomas said, still in that iron-fisted voice.  "Do we have
a problem?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Commander.  No problem," said Albrecht, speaking for all of them
as they sat.  
</p>

<p>
Colborn, on the other hand, remained standing, his face clenched in
fury.  "How dare&mdash;" he started to snarl.
</p>

<p>
Thomas's head swiveled to him with a movement like a gun turret
locking on target; Colborn froze.
</p>

<p>
"You were saying?" Thomas asked him in a deceptively mild tone that
utterly failed to mask the underlying threat.
</p>

<p>
"Ah...." Colborn fumbled for a non-life-threatening way to continue
the sentence.  "Ah...assuming that Afi actually <em>did</em> do
something to us, and that this wasn't us realizing our mistake in a
perfectly normal fashion...how was it that you weren't affected?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas's expression didn't change a bit.  "I was.  I just cut a very
good friend into sausage because my logic told me that our friendship
was not natural.  If I was wrong, then I fully expect the True God to
appear and strip me of my paladinhood, and possibly cast me directly
into the Pit.  The fact that He has not as yet doesn't mean anything;
it's possible that He may simply be waiting to do it in private."
</p>

<p>
We all digested that a bit.  Somewhat shakily, Colborn resumed his
seat. Unn turned away, unable to face the intensity of the moment.
Drifa got up from the table and paced to the door, her fingers
stroking her holy symbol absently as she whispered a prayer.
</p>

<p>
The tension was so thick it could be cut with a knife.  Desperately
looking for a way to put things back on an even keel, I reached into
the large pocket of my trenchcoat and pulled out my lovely Everful
Bottle of Liquid Perfection.  Grabbing the mugs, I quickly started
pouring and distributing drinks.
</p>

<p>
"A toast, to Thomas!" I cried, hoisting my mug high.  "The only one of
us clear-eyed enough, and strong enough in his convictions, to save us
all!"
</p>

<p>
The others were hesitant about reaching for their mugs; regardless,
they slowly raised them up, murmured the toast in unenthusiastic
voices, and took a sip.  Despite being unable to drink anything that
wasn't blood, Colborn was polite enough to touch the mug to his lips.
Suze tried a small sip and promptly started coughing.
</p>

<p>
Personally, I slammed mine down the hatch; I definitely needed the
bracer.  I was pressing myself back against the chair and keeping my
hands in my lap in order to conceal how badly I was shaking.  As
always, I'd been calm during the crisis (well, relatively calm), but
now that it was over the effects were hitting me hard, and the whole
'that was an undead' thing wasn't helping.  The air around me was full
of spots, and my head felt so light I was afraid it was going to drift
away.
</p>

<p>
"For the record, I side with Thomas," I told them.  "Afi was never our
friend, he just laid some sort of mindwhammy on all of you.  And, as
the only person who isn't affected by most of the laws of this world,
I think I'm probably the most qualified to judge."
</p>

<p>
Colborn and Albrecht gave slow, unhappy nods.  After a moment, Unn
muttered agreement as well.
</p>

<p>
"We've got a problem," Drifa said from the doorway.  We all turned to
see her kneeling over Afi's bones.  "These bones aren't more than a
year old," she told us.  "They can't be; the marrow is still fresh,
and there's virtually no wear or cracking on the bones themselves.
This wasn't Afi."
</p>

<p>
Everyone frowned.
</p>

<p>
"He was a half-elf when he walked in, but he changed back to a
skeleton when killed," Albrecht said in confusion.  "He must have been
under a Polymorph, so...." He trailed off, not sure where to go from
there.
</p>

<p>
"After I killed the half-elf, he transformed into the skeleton, and
the skeleton was pretty damn lively," Thomas told us flatly.  "Kept
swearing at me and trying to punch and kick; didn't stop until I sliced
it to fragments."
</p>

<p>
There was a pause as we all thought about that.
</p>

<p>
"He was under an anti-magic field the whole time..." I started,
thinking out loud.  "I guess the Polymorph undoing itself wasn't
really a magical effect, it was just some sort of
reality-reasserting-itself thing.  And when we cut our way in here, we
saw that anti-magic doesn't shut down skeletons or magical creatures
like wights, it just turns off their abilities.  So whatever that was,
its true form was a skeleton."
</p>

<p>
Unn was nodding, following the logic.  "A normal skeleton is mindless;
it wouldn't have been able to swear at Thomas.  Polymorph Other
doesn't grant the intelligence of the new form, so the half-elf
couldn't have talked to us.  It would have had to be a Polymorph Any
Object spell; that grants the intelligence and magical abilities of
the new creature."  
</p>

<p>
She paused, thinking, then wiggled her fingers and said, "Detect
Magic."  She surveyed each of us carefully.
</p>

<p>
"None of us are under any mind-affecting enchantments that I can see,
so if this thing modified our attitude&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It did," Thomas and I chorused.
</p>

<p>
Unn nodded absently.  "All right, so <em>when</em> this thing modified
our attitudes, it didn't do it by using a Mass Charm or Mass Suggestion.
Even if it were possible that such a spell affected us&mdash;and I
doubt it; Drifa's will is far too strong and the rest of us are no
slouches&mdash;even if we all were affected by such a thing, there
would still be an aura of enchantment around us."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht picked up the thread.  "If it wasn't a spell, that means it
must have been using the Diplomacy skill.  Polymorph Any Object could
turn a a skeleton into a half-elf, but it couldn't grant skills.  If
this thing affected us, it wasn't just a skeleton."
</p>

<p>
"Is it possible that Afi isn't as old as he lets on?" I asked
hopefully.  "Maybe he's a brand new lich and he just tells people that
he's really old?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht shook his head firmly.  "No.  He's always been pretty far
back in the shadows, but there are spotty records of him going back
hundreds of years.  And I fought him myself, before Gr&#491;fhamr was
founded."
</p>

<p>
"So...maybe you fought some other lich," I came back.  "Some other
lich, who was claiming to be Afi?  Maybe the whole thing was a big
bluff, and it created this whole 'Afi' persona to conceal its real
identity?"
</p>

<p>
Colborn shook his head.  "That's not really in character for most
liches...certainly not any of the ones I met while I was in service to
Hammond.  That level of deception is a lot of work to maintain, and it
isn't necessary unless you have enemies that could realistically harm
you.  You don't become a lich unless you're one of the most powerful
casters out there, and people at that level tend not to worry much
about attackers.  They've long ago set up sufficient defenses that
nothing less than another lich can get to them, and they're careful
not to get into direct conflict with each other&mdash;when you're
virtually immortal, why risk it?  There's usually a way that the two
of you can manage not to interfere with each other."
</p>

<p>
"And even if this <em>were</em> another lich who was just pretending
to be Afi, it would still have had to be more than a year old,"
Albrecht said.  "I was fighting Afi three years ago."
</p>

<p>
Silence fell.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe...some kind of Clone spell?" I asked hesitantly.
</p>

<p>
Drifa shook her head.  "Clone creates an inert body; when the source
creature dies, its soul migrates into the clone.  It wouldn't give a
conversational minion like this."  She stood up and brushed off her
robe.  "It doesn't have to be a lich; there <em>are</em> other undead
that could have filled the role&mdash;for example, a Death Knight.
That doesn't feel right though...it's nothing I can put my finger on,
but this didn't feel like a Death Knight, or any other kind of undead
I've met."
</p>

<p>
There was a moment of silence and then I spoke up.  "Out of
curiousity, how many&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A lot," she said, cutting me off.
</p>

<p>
Unn turned to me with an amused smile.  "Drifa never wanted to be in
the administration; she spent her first fifteen levels adventuring as
much as possible&mdash;mostly so as to avoid any possibility of
responsibility."
</p>

<p>
Drifa's head snapped up.  "Hey!  You're a fine one to talk!  What
about that research lab of yours, with all the&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Unn silenced her with a regal yet hurried wave of one hand.  "Now,
now, let's not get caught up in pettifogging details, my dear.  We
have more important things to discuss.  If you haven't met a lich
before and you can't think of another type of undead that seems more
correct to you, then I think we have to tentatively assume that this
actually <em>was</em> a lich.  Regardless of how strange that
seems, given the age.  <em>Have</em> you met a lich before?"
</p>

<p>
Drifa paced back to her chair, frowning.  "No, I haven't.  And I can't
think of anything else that feels likely.  There are things that it
might be&mdash;Eye of Fear and Flame, for example, although then it
should have gems in the eyes&mdash;but it's doubtful.  All the
different kinds of undead have slightly different affects...different
ways of standing, walking, tones of voice, things like that.  They
carry over to a Polymorphed form, at least somewhat."
</p>

<p>
She saw the question in my eyes and shrugged.  "You learn to spot
these things after you kill your nineteenth or twentieth critter
that's trying to pass itself off as something else in order to conceal
its weaknesses.  And I never saw anything like...whatever that was."
She gestured vaguely at the bone shards.  Looking grumpy, she sipped
her whiskey; immediately, her eyebrows shot up in pleased surprise and
she took a second (and larger) gulp.
</p>

<p>
"This is amazing," she told me, reverently.
</p>

<p>
I nodded and saluted her with my upraised mug.  It had somehow gotten
empty while she was talking, so I filled it up, raised it to her, and
took a gulp of my own in tribute to her sudden discovery of the glory
that is Macallan.
</p>

<p>
"So where does that leave us?" Thomas asked.  "This thing is too young
to be Afi, probably too young to be a lich, yet a lich is the only
thing that our expert thinks it could be.  What about a duplicate of
some sort?  Could it be a Simulacrum of Afi?"
</p>

<p>
Quickly, I flipped through the Brainopedia to find what Simulacrum was
all about.  Fortunately, it was there: seventh level arcane spell,
created a duplicate of the source creature from ice or snow.  The
duplicate was half as powerful as the original and when it was
destroyed it reverted to snow and immediately melted.
</p>

<p>
"I'm...not sure," Unn said uncertainly.  "When Thomas killed the
half-elf, the Polymorph faded and it reverted to being a skeleton.
When Thomas killed <em>that</em>, it stayed a skeleton.  Ordinarily a
Simulacrum would revert to snow, but it was inside an anti-magic field
at the time.  I haven't really studied the effects of expiring
transformation in a no-magic zone...."
</p>

<p>
She fell silent, ruminating on it.  We all watched her raptly, tension
hanging in the air.  All this talk of liches and undead was starting
to scratch at my hindbrain, whispering words of panic; I sent a shot
of whiskey to club those whispers unconscious, then refilled my mug
in case it needed reinforcements.
</p>

<p>
"I think..." Unn began slowly, thinking it through.  "I'd need to do
some experiments to be certain," she continued.  "Despite that, I
think what we've seen is consistent with a Simulacrum.  Polymorph is a
Transmutation effect, so it actually changes the nature of something,
here on the Material plane.  Simulacrum is a Shadow Illusion, so it
might behave differently."
</p>

<p>
She paused again, then nodded firmly and continued.  "Yes, I'm pretty
sure that it would work like what we're seeing.  Transmutation is a
question of forcing our reality to change and then 'holding' that
change against reality's...desire to revert, so to speak." She waved
her hands vaguely, clearly frustrated at the difficulty of explaining
what was clearly esoterica of her field to a bunch of laypeople.  "A
Transmutation effect uses the creature's life force as a power source
to hold that change.  When the life force is gone, the spell simply
ceases and, with nothing to maintain the change, the universe
reasserts itself.  A Shadow Illusion is tied to the energy of the
Plane of Shadow; the reversion is because, when the spell construct
collapses, it opens a small portal to the Plane of Shadow in order to
return the energy&mdash;to balance the books, so to speak.  If it was
being supressed at that moment, then perhaps it wouldn't manage to
rebalance before the spell completely collapsed.  I think, anyway."
She frowned in thought, sipping at her whiskey to grease the wheels of
her brain.
</p>

<p>
Drifa frowned.  "A Simulacrum is only half as powerful&mdash;and, more
importantly, half as <em>skilled</em>&mdash;as its source.  If that
thing changed our minds&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It <em>did,</em>" Thomas and I snarled.
</p>

<p>
She looked startled, but pressed on.  "Yes, yes.  If it was Diplomacy
that caused the change,"&mdash;she gave the two of us a speaking glare
to emphasize the new wording&mdash;"then it must have been a very
difficult task, especially since it was done in just a few seconds.
We were all hostile to Afi and immediately we became dear friends.  If
Afi could do that with only half his skills...well, I'm not ashamed to
admit that I'm frightened."
</p>

<p>
Everyone went quiet as the impact of that hit us.  The whispering in
the back of my head was getting louder, so I ordered the rest of my
mug of Scotch to go drown it.  It saluted and charged off.
Evidentally it was successful, because the voice got quieter and a
little more fuzzy and indistinct.
</p>

<p>
The silence dragged on for a minute until finally I couldn't stand it
anymore; thinking about Afi and the undead was causing my phalanx of
Macallan soldiers to lose the war against the panic-monsters.  I
needed to change the subject and get moving.
</p>

<p>
"Ok," I announced, standing up and clapping my hands for attention.
"Let's all keep chewing on it, but it doesn't seem like there's
anything more we can do on this right now.  I'm going outside to
sacrifice to Herr&uacute;n."  I grabbed a quill and some paper from
the mess in the center, scrawled out the outline of my 'blow the
everloving crap out of absolutely everything' plan (carefully keeping
the paper covered so that no one else could read it), folded it into
quarters, and straightened up.
</p>

<p>
"Everyone, write your secrets down and let's get moving," I told them.
It took a moment, but they all bent to the task.  A minute or three
later, we were all hustling out the door.
</p>

<p>
The reorganization of Gr&#491;fhamr made a tremendous difference;
every part of the city was within a dozen yards of the exit.  It
almost took us longer to walk out of the Mage's Magnificent Mansion
that housed the war room than it did to walk out of Gr&#491;fhamr
proper.
</p>

<p>
In the ravine outside, we were greeted with the sound and fury of
thousands of people resurrecting a goddess.  A dozen Gr&#491;fhamrs
(well, parts of Gr&#491;fhamr) were set up in pairs, one on each side
of the ravine.  Between each pair was a stone altar; the sides of each
altar were covered with white silk and the top had been scooped into a
smooth bowl-shaped hollow.  In each bowl burned a black flame, leaping
and dancing and stretching up towards the sky as though trying to
separate itself from this world of mud and rock and soar away to visit
the endless secrets of the void beyond.  The height of the flames
varied every few seconds.
</p>

<p>
A steady swarm of people were charging out of each of the
Gr&#491;fhamr nodes, pausing at the appropriate altar for just long
enough to drop in a piece of paper and mumble a few words, then racing
on to enter the opposite node.  All of them were carrying what was
clearly all their worldly possessions on their backs.  It was
eye-opening just how few possessions the people of Gr&#491;fhamr
called their own.
</p>

<p>
I stood and watched for a few moments; it was an amazing sight.  The
people moved like greased lightning; as each paper burned, the flames
would change color for a few seconds&mdash;usually a brilliant
white-gold, often the rich indigo of a stormy ocean or the sparkling
green-gold of sunlight through trees.  Very rarely, I saw a flash of
silver in various shades.  Each time, the flames reverted within
seconds to their original roiling black.  Each time, the person who
had made their sacrifice would continue sprinting on towards their new
home-node.  Somehow, thousands or tens of thousands of people were
racing back and forth and managing to weave flawlessly around one
another.  It was totally impossible and vastly irksome.
</p>

<p>
"Shtupid friggin' razza frazza idiotic non-laws of friggin' shtupid-ash
Shtupidworld," I mumbled to myself, trying to keep my voice low enough
that none of those around me would hear me complaining, yet again,
about how redonk-u-crazy their world was.
</p>

<p>
Evidentally I wasn't doing a very good job of estimating my volume
right now, because Thomas and several of Alpha Squad seemed to have
heard me.  I braced myself for whatever lecture I was about to
catch&mdash;probably something along the lines of "You're drunk, dude"
although I suspected they'd find another word for it.
</p>

<p>
"Neutralize Poison," was the only verbal response.  A hand clapped me
on the shoulder and suddenly my comfortable haze of Scotchy fog
vanished.  It was just me, all by myself, facing the terror of the
entire world.  I started to object, when&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Beautiful sight, isn't it?" Loki asked in a revoltingly chipper tone.
"Very well organized, too!  I can barely remember the last time I saw
a divine resurrection ritual, but I'm sure it didn't run as smoothly
as this."
</p>

<p>
We all pivoted to face him, everyone wearing expressions that varied
from 'Who the hell is this guy?' to 'Oh crap, here we go again',
depending on how much experience they had with this incarnation of
Trickster.
</p>

<p>
"Ah...hi, Loki?" I offered uncertainly.  A flash of inspiration hit
me.  "Want a drink?"  I proffered the Scotch.
</p>

<p>
He raised an eyebrow, but took a pull on the bottle.
</p>

<p>
His hair curled up tight, then snapped out to full extension, blowing
a party-favor kazoo salute in F-sharp.  His eyes popped out of his
head, grew to the size of dinner plates, then snapped back into their
sockets, stretching his face out of shape.  He had to blink hard to
make them shrink back to normal.
</p>

<p>
"Zowie!  Hot damn, that is good!  Where did you get it?" he asked,
taking another, deeper pull before reluctantly handing the bottle
back.
</p>

<p>
I discreetly wiped the neck off on my sleeve and took a slug
myself&mdash;just to be polite, of course.  "Arros gave it to me, the
last time I broke the world," I told him.
</p>

<p>
He nodded sagely.  "Makes sense.  Must be from your dimension; it's
certainly not local."  He stuck his left arm into his right ear, all
the way to the the elbow.  A moment of feeling around and then he
pulled the arm out, clutching a bottle that was identical to mine.
</p>

<p>
He upended the bottle, glugging the contents down for a good ten
seconds before stopping (there was, of course, no change in the
supply) and exaggeratedly wiping his mouth on his sleeve.
"Ahhhhhhhhhh," he acclaimed.  "Damn good stuff.  Anywho, just thought
I'd stop by, catch up, see how you're doing.  How's tricks, amigo?"
Just for an instant he wore a sombrero and a striped Mexican poncho.
</p>

<p>
The Deorsi, having twigged to who this was based on my earlier
stories, were all looking like mice at a catshow.  Thomas and Alpha
Squad, having had some recent exposure to gods, took it in stride and
showed only their professional poker faces.  I did notice that they
all had their hands resting casually on their swords.  They had to
know that they couldn't do anything against a god, but I had no doubt
they would try.
</p>

<p>
Loki glanced at the paper in my hand and brightened up.  "Aha!  Right,
thank you, that's what I was forgetting.  Here, let me do my part."
He flipped open a hidden compartment in his thumbnail and pulled out a
folded-up piece of parchment.  Parchment in hand, he sauntered to the
nearest altar.  He grew taller with every step, just a trace of his
true nature radiating out around him.  The Gr&#491;fhamrites slammed on
the brakes, scattering away from him like roaches caught in the light.
The flames calmed slightly as he approached, simmering lower and their
color shifting from putrid black to the red-gold of a normal flame.
</p>

<p>
"Herr&uacute;n, Lady of Secrets, take my secret unto thee!" the God of
Mischief cried, calling in a voice like an avalanche.  As he finished,
he dropped his parchment into the flames; they roared up ten, twenty,
thirty feet, flaring in a silver so pure that it bathed the entire
ravine in artificial moonlight for six long seconds.
</p>

<p>
An instant later he was back at my side, lounging in a beachchair
while wearing a Mickey Mouse beer hat, aviator glasses, and a Hawaiian
shirt.  Instead of cans of beer, the holsters on the hat were filled
with twin bottles of Macallan Cire Perdue and he was slurping on them
for all he was worth.
</p>

<p>
The flames were back to their previous height and once again normal
red-gold of normal fire.  It was a good twenty seconds before the
flames shifted back to their previous black, and a bit longer before
the Gr&#491;fhamrites resumed sacrificing their secrets in bursts of
white-gold, rich indigo, leaf-light green, and the very rare silver.
</p>

<p>
I could see Drifa's mouth working as she tried desperately to keep the
question behind her teeth, so I figured I'd save her the trouble.  
</p>

<p>
"What was that?" I demanded.  "Why would you sacrifice to resurrect
Herr&uacute;n?"
</p>

<p>
He pulled the shades down with one finger, staring at me in surprise.
"So that she contains a piece of me.  Duh."  He pushed the shades back
up, laced his fingers behind his head, and continued bathing in the
rays of the basketball-sized sun that was hovering ten feet above us.
</p>

<p>
I stepped forward, placing myself so that my shadow fell across his
chest and head.  "What does that mean?" I demanded.
</p>

<p>
He looked up at me grumpily and waved two fingers.  Starting at the
edge of his beachchair, my shadow bent a hundred and twenty degrees at
the waist so that it didn't touch him.
</p>

<p>
"Well what did you <em>think</em> you were doing?" he asked, slurping
more Macallan.  "You're sacrificing your own secrets, giving a piece
of yourself to help Herr&uacute;n stitch herself back together.
Your...hm...'lifeforce' isn't quite right...mind?  No.
Ermmm...'potentiality', maybe?"  He cocked his head in thought, then
nodded and shrugged.  "I suppose.  Yes, you're sacrificing a piece of
your potentiality so that she can exist.  That's not quite right, but
close enough for government work.  Anyway, point is, she'll be made
up of the little bits of everyone who sacrifices to her.  I wanted to
make sure that there was a piece of me in there."
</p>

<p>
A small anthropomorphic fish appeared, pedalling frantically on a
stationary bike to power the fan that blew a cooling breeze across
Loki's brow.  I ignored it.
</p>

<p>
"Does that mean you'll have control over her?" I asked.  In the corner
of my eye, I could see Albrecht shushing Colborn; Drifa and Unn were
wisely keeping their mouths shut, although they were clearly bursting
with questions.
</p>

<p>
He snorted.  "Control?  Nah.  She's a goddess.  Granted, under the
circumstances she won't be as head-to-head powerful as me, but she's
the friggin' Goddess of Secrets and Knowledge.  She's always been one
of the primary allies that any god needs&mdash;or needs to
neutralize&mdash;when things get serious.  But, since there's a
good-sized piece of me in there, she'll be inclined more favorably
towards me.  Gives me an edge next time one of the others gets
stroppy."
</p>

<p>
I tried to think about that one but couldn't; my blood had just frozen
and it was jamming up the gears in my brain.  Clearly, I needed some
anti-freeze, so I administered some.
</p>

<p>
Drifa finally couldn't contain herself.  "If that's the case, why
haven't all the other gods shown up to 'put pieces of themselves in',
as you call it?" she demanded.
</p>

<p>
Loki rolled his head to look at her; the hat and shades vanished just
long enough for him to give her a charming wink and smile, the light
gleaming off his flowing golden locks and snow-white teeth.  Then they
reappeared and he went back to sunbathing.
</p>

<p>
"That <em>is</em> the trick, now isn't it?" he said casually, slurping
a few thousand dollars worth of Macallan out of his beerhat.  "Let me
know when you figure it out," he told her insouciantly.
</p>

<p>
"As long as we're discussing tricks," Albrecht said, stepping forward
with a diplomat's studied calm.  "Why did you insist that Jake blow up
Her temple?"
</p>

<p>
Loki smiled without moving anything but his mouth.  "Well, you know
me.  True Neutral; just can't help messing with everyone in reach.
That day, it was your turn in the barrel."  He glanced over, peering
over the shades to do so.  "Tell you what, though; that little trick
made your life pretty tough, so I'll do you a favor: you've got it
wrong.  Herr&uacute;n's major portfolio is secrets and her minor is
knowledge; you get the most bang for your buck by sacrificing secrets,
but you can also sacrifice random pieces of knowledge.  Just make sure
that it's actually something that matters, and be prepared for the
fact that you won't be able to learn it again&mdash;even if someone
came up and told you what it was that you sacrificed, you wouldn't be
able to understand them.  The words would just be gibberish."
</p>

<p>
I gazed at him in contemplation for a long moment as puzzle pieces
slid around in my brain and snapped together. Was I right?  If so,
this could be of incalculable advantage.  But if I was wrong....
</p>

<p>
I turned to my loyal memory maiden and assistant.  "Suze, pen me," I
asked.  She dug quickly in her beltpouch and passed me a charcoal
stick and some paper.
</p>

<p>
I walked over to Loki and squatted down.  "You're going to want us to
be very private for this," I murmured.
</p>

<p>
He raised an eyebrow at that, but then turned to the others and made a
shooing gesture.  "Vamoose, alla you.  Feelin' crowded here, I need
some space."
</p>

<p>
The Landguard looked rebellious but I waved them off; reluctantly,
they stepped back a couple paces.  Suze hurried to get behind Thomas,
while the Deorsi hastily retreated a dozen yards.
</p>

<p>
Loki shooed them again, scowling.  "Back off!  Really, seriously and
for true."  Again the Landguard checked in with me by eye; again I
waved them back.  They unwillingly retreated thirty yards or so, the
others scurrying to stay behind them.
</p>

<p>
"You're not just freezing time?" I asked Loki curiously.  "Wouldn't
that have been simpler?"
</p>

<p>
He shrugged.  "When you're hiding from wolves, you put all your
efforts into camouflaging your camp, not into lighting a bonfire."
</p>

<p>
My enhanced brain latched onto that casual comment, spun it around and
pulled it apart, picking the nuggets of information out of it like a
diner picking out lobster claw meat. I hmm'd quietly, thinking through
the implications.
</p>

<p>
I took a minute to scribble something down on the paper, then turned
it so that Loki could read it.
</p>

<p>
"I was thinking about sacrificing this litttle secret," I told the God
of Lies, Michief, and Trickery.  "What do you think?"
</p>

<p>
He looked at the paper disinterestedly, then turned his eyes up to
mine; I was careful not to actually meet his gaze.  Instead, I stared
at the bridge of his nose.
</p>

<p>
"Up to you," he said with a casual shrug.  "Not a good idea to
sacrifice untrue things, though."
</p>

<p>
I gave an equally casual shrug.  "Oh, ok.  Well, then I suppose I
should go tell Thomas and the others&mdash;you know, those paladins
who just converted to Shailos and are therefore getting a lot of his
attention&mdash;that this isn't true.  I wouldn't want them to get the
idea on their own and accidentally act on it."
</p>

<p>
He looked at me steadily for several very long seconds.  I started to
sweat, but refused to give ground.
</p>

<p>
Finally he tipped his head in acknowledgement of my victory.  "What do
you want?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
I tried hard to disguise my sigh of relief, but he probably noticed.
"Well, I figure that having some bards perform your song was worth
twenty questions.  This is <em>at least</em> twice as important, so
how about we say that I sacrifice this and I get an even fifty this
time?"
</p>

<p>
He snorted.  "Pull the other one, it's got bells on.  This would be
inconvenient but it's hardly important. I could just wipe it from your
mind, but I admire the chutzpah; I'll give you five questions."
</p>

<p>
I smiled like a shark.  "You wouldn't be dealing at all if it weren't
important.  And if you could wipe my mind, you would have.
Something's stopping you&mdash;you can freeze time around me, but you
can't actually mess with my head, can you?  What is it, a bigger
deity?"
</p>

<p>
He sighed dramatically, shaking his head ruefully.  "Jake, c'mon,
don't try to get into this stuff; you'll just embarrass yourself.  I'm
trying to be nice here, but I don't want to haggle any more.  I'll
make you a final offer: nine questions, last and final.  Admiring your
chutzpah only goes so far, kid.  After a while, it just gets
annoying."
</p>

<p>
I pulled a sad face.  "Oh, rats.  Well, that's kind of you but I
wouldn't want to be annoying.  Let's just let it go."  I turned away,
raising a hand to wave to the Landguard.  "Hey, Thomas, c'mere!"
</p>

<p>
Loki flicked a finger and the words froze in mid-air; they fell to the
ground in the form of a giant speech bubble.  The bubble hit the
ground and popped, vanishing.
</p>

<p>
"Twenty questions.  Don't push it," he growled.
</p>

<p>
"And this time you won't be deceptive.  Real, honest, complete
answers, no deception," I warned him.
</p>

<p>
He stared flatly at me.  "Eight questions.  Real, honest, complete, no
deception.  But if I say I can't or won't answer something, you don't
push it. Now quit while you're ahead."
</p>

<p>
I couldn't help squeezing one last edge.  "Ok, but if you don't answer
it, then that question doesn't count."  He glared at me, but
reluctantly nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Sold!" I told him, sticking out a hand to shake.  He took my hand in
his paw&mdash;a literal bear paw: fur, claws, and all.  It engulfed my
hand, my wrist, and on up to my elbow.  The claws ended up resting on
the veins of my forearm, scratching very lightly over my
suddenly-very-fragile-seeming skin.  A tiny trickle of blood began to
run down towards my fingers.
</p>

<p>
I looked up and made the mistake of meeting Loki's eyes;
soul-wrenching terror boiled up from the back of my mind, so powerful
I would have collapsed except that His power held me motionless.  My
bowels loosened and my bladder let go; I was suddenly swimming in the
stench of my own wastes as I marinated in a bath of fear-sweat.
</p>

<p>
"Don't do this again," Loki told me softly.  His voice was completely
calm, almost disinterested.  It was vastly more terrifying than any
overstated belligerent snarling.
</p>

<p>
I nodded frantically, making myself look like a crazed bobblehead.
</p>

<p>
He let that horrifying gaze linger on me for another moment, then
vanished.  I instantly collapsed to the ground, desperately hoping
that I could pass out.
</p>

<p>
Thomas and Alpha Squad were beside me before I could blink.  The
moment they saw my condition, Rob, and Franklin turned and moved to
block Albrecht and the others from coming any closer.  Apparently,
protecting their Emperor also included protecting his dignity.
</p>

<p>
"Prestidigitation," Bob said, pointing at my filthy jeans.  A few
seconds later, they were clean and dry.  A few seconds after that, my
entire body was clean and non-sweaty; my hair was even styled, and my
teeth were polished whiter than the dentist had ever gotten them.
</p>

<p>
I was still shaking like a leaf in a hurricane, but I grabbed on to
Thomas's arm and dragged myself to my feet.  
</p>

<p>
"Need to make sacrifice," I mumbled, teeth chattering.  Fortunately,
he didn't argue with me; he just turned and paced slowly to the
nearest altar.  I leaned hard on his arm the whole way; he was
effectively carrying me, but he managed to do it subtly enough that I
just looked wobbly instead of noodle-riffic.  The Landguard and the
others trailed along behind.
</p>

<p>
When we got to the altar I leaned on it 'casually' while I waited for
the tremors to stop.  I didn't trust myself to pull out my papers and
sacrifice them without dropping them, or having my tremors rip them to
shreds.  To cover my need for a break I waved the others to go ahead
with their sacrifices.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht was first; he produced a wax-sealed packet of paper and
dropped it reverently into the flames.  "Lady of Secrets, may my gift
help you be strong."  For a moment the flames grew higher and
flickered leaf-light green before reverting to their previous black.
</p>

<p>
Franklin was the next closest to the altar, but he hesitated, not
moving until Robert pushed him forward.  The young Landguard seemed
uncomfortable as he dropped his paper in, and he murmured his prayer
too softly to be heard.  I suspected that he was having trouble
reconciling his participation in this ritual with his god's "I am the
One True Blah Blah Blah" attitude.  As he finished the prayer and
turned away, the flames flashed white-gold and flickered; not as high
as when Albrecht sacrificed, but noticeably.
</p>

<p>
Drifa followed him.  Her prayer was more reverent and lasted longer;
when she finished, the flames roared up, stormy blue light bathing us
all before the flames went back to being black.
</p>

<p>
One by one, they all made their sacrifices.  Aside from Albrecht, only
Suze's sacrifice turned the flames green; Colborn and Thomas both got
white-gold flames, while Unn's flames were that so-very-rare pale
silver.  It was a lighter silver than what Loki had produced, and not
nearly so high, but it was still interesting.  Alpha Squad went
through one after the other, and they all got white-gold flames.  The
amount that the flames increased in size varied wildly; Suze's secret
made them jump a few inches, while Albrecht's had put a full two feet
on them.  Everyone else was in between those extremes.
</p>

<p>
Finally, it was my turn.  The others all stepped back and looked at me
expectantly.  Thomas had the hint of a frown on his face; I suspect he
was remembering my "I don't like gods and religion is horrible" speech
from way back when.  (And by 'way back when', I actually meant 'less
than two weeks ago'.  God, how time flies when you're hating every
minute of it.)
</p>

<p>
The shakes were mostly gone by now; I was still a little wobbly, but
it was manageable.  I pulled out the two packets and studied them for
a moment while I tried to work out what to say.
</p>

<p>
"Lady Herr&uacute;n...I'm not a religious man," I started. Thomas
groaned almost subaudibly.  "In my world there's no evidence that gods
exist, and religion has generally been a bad thing for my world.  It's
left me...not just an atheist, but an antitheist."
</p>

<p>
Thomas was making a subtle 'get on with it' gesture with one hand,
keeping his body turned so the others couldn't see him doing it.  I
noted it and ignored it.
</p>

<p>
"Coming to this world has been hard for me, for a lot of reasons.  One
big problem is all the gods I keep running into; I can't deny they
exist, and the existence of paladins and clerics and healing magic
shows that they&mdash;that <em>you</em>&mdash;really do make the world
a measurably better place.  You in particular; without you, all of us
are almost certainly de&mdash;" Suze shifted in my peripheral vision,
looking nervous and unhappy.
<p>

<p>
"&mdash;dealing with a lot of grief that we won't have to if you're
willing to help us.  You and your 'potential for a dream' made it
clear to me that you're real, and that you can do real, serious
things...we didn't think you'd be able to reach into Gr&#491;fhamr
yet, but you did.  You're one impressive lady, and we really need your
help."
</p>

<p>
I sighed and looked at the two papers in my hand, weighing them
against each other before selecting the 'how to destroy the world'
paper.  "It's very hard for me to participate in a ritual like this,
so please understand that this sacrifice is not just of a secret, it
is also a part of who I am and how I've always viewed myself and the
world around me.  I know it's not a secret but...hopefully it will
mean something to you."
</p>

<p>
I stepped up to the altar and tossed the paper in.  As the details of
my Armageddon plan vanished in smoke and fire, I called out loudly:
"Lady of Secrets, let my secret strengthen thee!"  Somehow, the
archaic language seemed appropriate.
</p>

<p>
There was a noise like a bomb going off; the fire from the altar
pinwheeled through colors that existed only in the nightmares of
H.P. Lovecraft; the flames blazed fifty feet up into the sky, burning
so brightly they looked like a plasma lance aimed at the sky.
</p>

<p>
Dead silence filled the ravine.
</p>

<p>
No one moved, no one spoke. The only sound was the sussurance of the
breeze and the low crackle of the red-gold fires that burned on every
altar up and down the ravine. Thousands of people just stood, staring
in slack-jawed amazement at what I had done.  A light dusting of
white ash rained down across us, but no one moved to brush it off.
</p>

<p>
I coughed out some ash that I had accidentally inhaled and looked at
the second paper, the one I had blackmailed Loki with.  I wasn't eager
for a repeat performance, but it did need to be destroyed.
</p>

<p>
"Lady of Secrets, may <em>this</em> secret strengthen you as well!" I
called, casting the folded-up packet into the flames and unconsciously
wincing back a little.
</p>

<p>
The sonic blast was enough to hurl me off my feet and throw me several
yards. The tower of unnameably-hued flames climbed a thousand feet
into the night sky, easily obliterating the paper and the message that
it carried:
</p>

<p>
<center><em>When Loki first appeared to me, he said 'Ring me if you
need anything, and all my best wishes to you'.<br />He was suggesting
the Ring of Three Wishes loop, knowing that it was against the
Edict.<br />When I executed the loop and Ilara came to punish me, Loki
appeared to protect me.<br />Loki is helping our side, but doing it
subtly.  He is playing both sides of this war against each
other.</em></center>
</p>

<p>
The flames burned high for ten, twelve long seconds before dying down.
I lay sprawled on the ground, white ash raining down on me as I stared
in disbelief at what I had done.
</p>

<em><strong>Author's Note, part deux:</strong> a couple chapters ago,
I forgot an attribution: thank you to BinarySobriquet for the
suggestion about flying Gr&#491;fhamr around as a way to avoid
mass-teleport detection.  The funny part was that I already had
created the Sky Slayer (mentioned back in ch39), and simply didn't
think of the fact that it could also be applied to Gr&#491;fhamr.  So,

</p>
<p>
"In a society without death, Ingfred is 20 years old and has no
prospects. All the good jobs are filled by undying masters of their
craft, and it's hard to be taken seriously when you are, compared to
everyone around you, an infant.  Fortunately, he has a solution:
undergo an illegal transformation and sell the memory to The
Experiental Herald for a ridiculous sum.
</p>

<p>
There's two problems: how can Ingfred convince a powerful wizard to
risk his mage license and his freedom to help with such a crazy plan?
And, once that's done...how will Ingfred deal with the law?"
