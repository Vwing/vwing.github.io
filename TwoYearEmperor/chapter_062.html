<p>
"So, I'm confused...are you saying you <em>don't</em> like being
Good?" I asked.  I wasn't actually confused, it was just a tactic.  He
had a legitimate grievance on the 'you beat me up and forcibly
converted me' point; by diverting him onto a subject that he couldn't
actually object to I could put him on the defensive and shut the
argument down.  It wouldn't have worked against Albrecht or Thomas,
but from everything Colborn had told us, Hammond was too socially
clueless&mdash;too <em>straightforward</em>&mdash;to recognize what I
was doing.
</p>
  
<p>
Worked like a charm, too.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I like being Good!" the ancient skeleton monster
complained.  "That's not the point!"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht frowned in apparent puzzlement.  "Are you objecting to the
fact that we helped you stop being Evil?  Because you really were
killing an awful lot of people in those experiments of yours, you
know.  In pretty awful ways."
</p>

<p>
"That was perfectly valid research!" Hammond replied, sounding more
defensive by the moment.  "And it's going to do a lot of good!  We can
use my research to extend humanoid lifespans by at least ten percent,
and I was right on the edge of a major breakthrough that would have
made it twenty or thirty percent."
</p>

<p>
"But weren't you doing that research in order to create a magical
plague that would convert every living thing into mind controlled
slaves?" Thomas asked.  Say what you like about military 'unsubtle
doorkicker' stereotypes, Thomas was a good enough political animal
that he sounded honestly interested with just a trace of quiet
disapproval.  Perhaps not even disapproval; more like disappointment.
God, it was brilliant.  I really wish Hammond still had a face that I
could read expressions from, because I would have liked to see the
look on his face right now.
</p>

<p>
"Well, yes, maybe a bit of mind control," he mumbled.  "After
all, <em>someone</em> has to run the world. But&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And wasn't the life extension element just so that your new slaves
would live longer so they could breed more minions for you?" Thomas
inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Well, yes, but&mdash;" He was on the edge of stammering by now.
Excellent.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht actually <em>patted the lich on the back comfortingly.</em>
God, the man had giant brass ones.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right," he said reassuringly.  "We all do things that we
regret.  Personally, I regret that I had to sacrifice a Legion of
troops in order to save the three million citizens of Gr&#491;fhamr
from being killed by Afi.  You'll get over it.  And now that you're
Good, you wouldn't think of using something like that plague, would
you?  Isn't that a good thing?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't use his name, it could attract the Death God's attention,"
Drifa reminded us.
</p>

<p>
Hammond looked at her incredulously, then shrugged acknowledgment of
the issue.  "Fine.  What should I call him?"
</p>

<p>
"We've been calling him 'Lichboy,'" I said helpfully.
</p>

<p>
I'm fairly sure he grimaced&mdash;hard to tell when he had no face. "I
am <em>not</em> referring to him as 'Lichboy,'" he informed us firmly.
</p>

<p>
Thomas got a wicked gleam in his eye but his voice was completely
serious.  "I suggest 'Melvin.'"
</p>

<p>
We all looked at him.
</p>

<p>
"What?" I demanded.  "Melvin?"
</p>

<p>
He shrugged, still with that same wicked gleam.  "Well, we have to
call him <em>something</em>, and 'Lichboy' starts to seem a bit
juvenile after a while."  He paused. "Also, 'Melvin' is a goofy name."
</p>

<p>
We all thought about that.  "Fine," I said.  "Melvin.  So mote it be.
So, Hammond, any intelligence on Melvin?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not calling him 'Melvin' either," Hammond stated firmly.  "'High
King' seems more reasonable."
</p>

<p>
I shrugged; so did most of the others.  "Ok, you call him 'High King'
and we'll all call him 'Melvin.'  Either way, anything to share?"
</p>


<p>
"Well, no, I wouldn't...but that's not the point," Hammond tried
again.  "The point is that&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Excellent!" Albrecht said with a sunny smile.  "I'm glad that's
settled.  Onwards, then!  We were talking about how to deal with the
other Liches, especially Melvin.  Any particular intelligence you
could share with us?"
</p>

<p>
Hammond glared at him.  "It is <em>not</em> settled.  You people
invaded my home and <em>took away my magic</em>!  Why in the Hells
would I want to help you?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht smiled gently and spread his hands in wordless apology.  "We
are sorry about that, truly.  As we said before, your magic will
return in a week or so.  So, <em>do</em> you have any intelligence you
could share with us?  After all, the only thing that is required for
Evil to triumph is for Good beings to do nothing."  Albrecht voice was
almost sickly sweet as he finished the aphorism.
</p>

<p>
Hammond sighed.  After a moment he gathered himself and started over.
"Yes, fine.  I do.  First of all, the High King is the one pushing
this whole fight, and only because the Death God is forcing him to.
By all reports, the High King would just as soon go back to his
research and let the war die off.  I and all the other Lich Kings,
we're only in it because he insists.  If he backed off, we'd be done
too."  He sniffed disapprovingly.  "War is wasteful of time and
resources.  There are so many more interesting things to do."

<p>
Albrecht nodded.  "Ok, good.  If we somehow manage to get rid of
Melvin, is there anyone else that the Death God could use in his
place?"
</p>

<p>
Hammond thought about that for a second, then shook his head. "Not
really.  None of the rest of us have the power to compel the others so
completely.  With the High King out of the picture, the leadership
would mostly fragment, with everyone going off in their own direction
and many of us pulling out completely."
</p>

<p>
"So we have two separate points of failure," I said hopefully.
"Great.  Granted, neither of them are exactly soft targets, but at
least we have some avenues of attack."  I thought for a moment, then
asked, "Why couldn't the Death God simply sockpuppet all of you?
You're all undead, right?  Shouldn't that put you under his purview?"
</p>

<p>
Hammond snorted.  "Of course not.  The mindless undead,
sure&mdash;they're His, and He can do what he likes with them.  We
still have free will, and He's not able to directly force us into
anything against our own choice.  None of the gods can."
</p>

<p>
Well, <em>that</em> was interesting.  And it played well with the fact
that Loki hadn't been able to simply rip information out of my brain
when I figured out whatever it was that I sacrificed about him.  I had
no idea what the secret was, and the parts of our conversation where
we had explicitly discussed it were just a fog in my memory, but I
remembered the rest of it clearly.  I had blackmailed Loki with the
threat of revealing <em>something</em>, and he had actually caved to
the blackmail instead of simply erasing my memories of it.
</p>

<p>
"So then why can he control...Melvin?" Drifa asked.
</p>

<p>
Hammond glanced at her.  "Because the High King accepted a shard of
the Death God's power.  It was one of the few mistakes he's made in
recorded history.  With that shard inside him, the Death God can
compel his obedience to a large extent."
</p>

<p>
Eyebrows went up around the room.  Soooo...Afi had a divine energy
packet running around inside him?  That was interesting.  It couldn't
be sentient the way Fragment was, or he would never have been able to
get away with his 'making himself forget about his Ice Assassins'
trick, but it was yet another avenue of attack.  Remove the shard and
Neklos wouldn't be able to control Afi anymore, at which point he
might choose to pull out of the war.
</p>

<p>
"Good to know," Thomas said.  "Anything else?"
</p>

<p>
Hammond looked distinctly uncomfortable.  "It might be worth talking
about the other Lich Kings.  I have a lot more information on them,
and I think that&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You said that Melvin is the key," Reynard put in, clearly enjoying
the codename.  "I'd say he takes first priority in the discussions.""
</p>

<p>
Hammond sighed.  "All right, fine."  He paused to gather his thoughts.
"For about a year now, the High King's been buying up every copy of
Mindscrape that he can get his hands on&mdash;scrolls, spellbooks,
notebooks containing research notes on the spell, everything.  The
only thing that makes sense is that he's doing research on it.  More
importantly, though, he's been paying for them in magic
items&mdash;<em>lots</em> of magic items, way more than he could
plausibly have made on his own.  So many that he's actually flooded
the market and devalued the things."
</p>

<p>
I frowned.  "Wait, what?  Why pay with magic items instead of gold?
And how do you devalue a magic item?"
</p>

<p>
All of the original Anundj&aring;ns (i.e. everyone except Thomas and
Suze) just sighed and looked at me pityingly.
</p>

<p>
"Gold is worthless in a modern society," Albrecht explained with the
carefully neutral tone of voice that you use when you're explaining
something simple to an idiot but you don't want to be rude.  "Well,"
he corrected himself.  "It's fine for food and clothing and things
that you buy in a shop, but even there it's not important for an
individual; if you don't have gold and you only need to supply
yourself, you can always create the objects directly using magic.
Fabricate, True Creation, Wish, Polymorph Any Object&mdash;at a high
level, gold just doesn't matter.  It's only when you're dealing with
large groups"&mdash;he waved his hands to indicate the enormity of
Gr&#491;fhamr&mdash;"that it becomes impractical to supply everything
by way of magic.
</p>

<p>
"Magic items aren't like clothes," he continued.  "Aside from Wish, you
can't create magic items by simple magic, only through the crafting
process.  That requires experience points and takes a long time; as
such, no mage is going to give magic items away for something as
trivial as a lump of metal."
</p>

<p>
I stumbled over that just a bit, preconceived notions grinding
together until they shattered and a new pattern emerged.  The elements
sparkled in my brain, connections drawing themselves neatly across the
walls of my skull like a 3-D concept map: a new level of economics,
floating on top of the old.  Stratified society; the people of high
level utterly divorced from the common herd, few or no needs or goals
in common.  Post-scarcity; only unique things would be of value, such
as the right to join a club, access to a unique experience, use of a
piece of land or other un-reproducible resource...perhaps access to an
ephemeral art piece such as music, light shows, or the pastries of a
master p&acirc;tisserie.  Could copyright laws be used to create
artificial scarity (and therefore value) for written words and
physical paintings?  Maybe, but probably not; it worked poorly for the
RIAA, after all.
</p>

<p>
"Right," I said, nodding in eventual comprehension.  "So, if Melvin
is generating and selling a ton of magic items then he's causing
inflation to the point where no one else can afford to buy anything.
Pretty soon, if it's sustainable and no one else has the trick, he's
the only one with any purchasing power.  Any ideas on how he's doing
it?"
</p>

<p>
Hammond shrugged, the gesture punctuated by a clatter of clavicles.
"I can think of a few ways it <em>could</em> be done, but none of them
are terribly plausible.  He's got more casters working for him than
anyone else; he could be forcing them to spend all their time
crafting, burning their experience points away.  Or perhaps he's using
slaves as an experience point battery, having them pay for the items
that his magi are crafting.  Even then, he's handing out more items
than are believable unless he's devoting the vast majority of his
casters to the task.  And that seems doubtful; crafting magic items is
time-consuming and intensely boring work that few magi are willing to
do continuously.  You would think he'd start getting dissension in the
ranks, probably even desertion."
</p>

<p>
Reynard cocked his head in confusion.  "What sort of magic items?
Potions and other expendables?  Because if it's permanent items, I
don't see how he isn't shutting down his own purchasing power as
well."
</p>

<p>
Hammond humphed in irritation.  "Expendables, yes, but more than that.
Swords, armor, wands, rings, whatever you want for outfitting your
troops and minions.  They have time limits on them, though&mdash;after
a week, or a month, or three months, they become nonmagical.  People
still accept them, though&mdash;they're so much cheaper than regular
items that the expiration clauses don't matter.  Especially since he's
handing out contracts: in exchange for whatever he wants he'll give a
hundred thousand +5 swords per month for six months...each with a
one-month expiration date.  Or a thousand Staves of the Magi that have
only thirty charges each.  Or a spellbook with a hundred spells,
except the spells can't be copied out of the book and the book goes
blank after a hundred days.  He'll even produce items to order but,
again, they expire in short order."
</p>

<p>
Drifa whistled, soft and low.  "That's...evil.  Brilliant.  But evil."
</p>

<p>
"Have you attempted to use Wish to modify the items in order to excise
the expiration clause?" Isaac asked.
</p>

<p>
Hammond gave him what I was pretty sure was a sour expression&mdash;it
was hard to tell with no lips to tighten or eyelids to squint.  "Of
course I've tried that, and so has everyone else.  Doesn't work.  If
the items are targeted with a Wish, or any other magic that could
potentially modify them, they immediately become nonmagical."
</p>

<p>
"Magical DRM.  Cool," I said thoughtfully.  "These are all custom
items we're talking about.  I haven't seen very many other custom
items&mdash;the tools of the tradesmen back in Capital City, the
showerhead in the castle, but no armor or weapons or such.  How come
Melvin is the only one making them?"
</p>

<p>
Unn shrugged.  "There are custom items around, but they aren't common.
Artificing isn't a popular area of study; what mage wants to burn
thousands upon thousands of experience points doing research into
items that might or might not have a market?  Even if you're just
using them for yourself, it still takes a long time to make them and,
again, it uses up hard to replace experience."
</p>

<p>
"The Landguard's armor and much of our equipment is custom," Thomas
supplied.  "For example, our poison detection rings and Sending
gauntlets."
</p>

<p>
I nodded, seeing the corollary.  "But you're an elite organization
with national resources behind you.  Makes sense."
</p>

<p>
There was a pause as we all thought through the implications.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we need to figure out how he's doing it, and we've got an easy
way," I said.  I looked at the newest addition to our team.  "Hammond,
all you need to do is arrange a trade conference with Melvin.  Say that
you want to make a major purchase but need to negotiate the terms.
He'll let you into his castle&mdash;or whatever he has&mdash;and you
can spy out how he's doing it."  I paused, then continued with more
excitement.  "Actually, even better&mdash;we Polymorph you into
something not undead, then send you in with a bunch of Continual Light
stones that you can use to wipe out Melvin and all his minions."
</p>

<p>
"He'd just regenerate back at his phylactery," Drifa pointed out,
shaking her head.
</p>

<p>
"True," Reynard acknowledged.  "But we might be able to use the
opportunity to derive some information about where he keeps his
phylactery.  Search his base for research notes, written plans,
records&mdash;at the very least we could destroy one of his major
centres of operation, eliminate many of his prime resources.  And it
will put him out of commission for a few days.  In fact&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
We all looked at Hammond in surprise.  "What do you mean, 'No'?" I
asked.
</p>

<p>
He shook his skull.  "No.  No way am I going up against the High King.
Lich Queen Magnhild challenged him, shortly after my enlichment.  She
was three thousand years old, both a wizard and a cleric, had
incredible resources&mdash;frankly, she terrified all of us.  She
decided that he had been getting too powerful, making too many inroads
into the Underdark community, bringing too many of the other liches
under his sway.  She gathered her Legions, bound hundreds of demons
and elementals...everything that a brilliant and powerful mage could
do to prepare for war.  She was cunning, strategic, an expert
tactician with millenia of battlefield experience, and he crushed her
like she was nothing.  Within two days, the fight was over.  All of
her troops were dead or scattered.  All of her demons had been
re-bound to the High King's service.  He commanded our presence,
required all of the Lich Kings to assemble.  He had her imprisoned in
a cage, under an anti-magic field, on display for all of us to view.
He explained, so very calmly, what had happened.  And when he
finished, the roof of the cage slammed down and she was crushed to
splinters."
</p>

<p>
He paused, looking up and to the side a bit as he submerged into the
memory.  
</p>

<p>
"Her soul streamed away, vanishing into the space between dimensions
as it raced back to her phylactery.  And then the High King held up
her phylactery.  It was a clay urn; I'll never forget the colors of
the glaze.  He explained precisely how it had been warded:
nondetection spells, glamours of disguise, buried within a fortress in
an extradimensional space the entrance of which was located <em>on the
home plane of her goddess."</em>
</p>

<p>
He looked at us; somehow, even with empty eyesockets, his gaze seemed
haunted.  "It wasn't just a story.  He showed it to us, revealed the
exact methods by which it had all been accomplished, showed us the
wreckage of the golems that had guarded it, even summoned Magnhild's
goddess and had Her confirm it."  He paused to let that sink in.  "He
commanded the presence of a goddess, <em>and She came.</em>  She came,
confirmed everything he had said, and then left."  Seeing the thought
in all our eyes, he shook his head.  "And no, it was no trick.  We all
felt Her power.  There is nothing like the presence of a deity, no way
to fake it.  And I can think of no reason why a goddess would lie over
such a thing."
</p>

<p>
He held up his right hand in memory, as though offering up a physical
object.  "He showed us her phylactery," he said, voice far away as he
relived the memory.  "He explained all the details, and then he
crushed the thing to powder in his fist."  His skeletal hand closed
spasmodically, knucklebones grinding together.
</p>

<p>
He watched the memory for a moment longer, then dropped his hand and
shifted his eyeless gaze back to us.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know how many protective spells there are on a phylactery?" he
asked.  "How resistant they are to damage?  Even when first created,
they're resilient; once their creator has finished hardening them and
layering on protections, they are the next best thing to
indestructible.  For any creature to effortlessly close his hand and
reduce one to powder...it's virtually inconceivable.  And again, it
wasn't a trick.  We heard her scream as her soul was sucked into the
underworld.  Just like with the presence of a goddess, there is no way
to imitate the scream of a lich's soul being consumed by That Which
Awaits."
</p>

<p>
He shook his skull more firmly.  "There is <em>no way</em> I am going
to oppose the High King.  I'll deal with the other liches but I am not
going to do <em>anything</em> that he could perceive as an attack."
</p>

<p>
He studied us for a moment, then turned and walked out of
Gr&#491;fhamr.  In his wake, silence reigned.
</p>

<p>
"Well," I said thoughtfully.  "That just happened."
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
We had walked in silence for at least fifteen minutes, pondering what
Hammond had told us, before the thought occurred to me.  I started
kicking myself for not thinking of it sooner.
</p>

<p>
"Hey, I've got a question," I demanded of Albrecht, stopping to face
him.  "If Melvin is so badass-lich trivial-killing and
goddess-commanding, how are you still alive?"
</p>

<p>
He seemed a bit flummoxed by that.
</p>

<p>
"Preparation," Thomas said, leaning back on the wall and folding his
arms.  "Melvin would have known of the other liches, known they were
threats.  He would have recognized that Magnhild was a very serious
threat, and would have prepared.  Who knows how many
decades&mdash;perhaps even centuries or millenia&mdash;he spent
researching her and the other Lich Kings.  He would have had plenty of
time to put all his plans in place, learn all of their secrets.  When
the threat materialized, he acted."
</p>

<p>
"Ok..." I responded dubiously.  "That doesn't really explain it
though.  Why wouldn't he have had similar plans for Albrecht and
Anundj&aring;?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht was nodding agreement with Thomas's line of reasoning.  "It
makes sense.  Melvin lived primarily in the Underdark.  All our
records suggest that he had very rare contact with the surface; we
would have been utterly peripheral to him.  No one can plan and
prepare for absolutely everything, and we were far away and not much
of a threat."  He snorted in gallows humor.  "And, to be honest, I was
probably simply too young for him to have noticed. I didn't become a
High Marshal until two centuries ago.  If he wasn't maintaining
constant surveillance on Anundj&aring; he could easily have failed to
notice my existence."
</p>

<p>
Thomas gave Albrecht a curt nod; there was clearly still resentment
there, but also acknowledgement of the little general's skills.  "He
didn't have specific contingency plans in place for Anundj&aring; or
for you.  Remember what Loki told us: the Death God is a micromanager.
He must have assigned Melvin to start the war and insisted that it
happen immediately.  Melvin did an excellent job, but he was fighting
on a relatively equal footing, having had to throw the invasion
together on short notice.  Running everything on the fly, he wouldn't
have been able to devote his entire attention to fighting
you"&mdash;he nodded to Albrecht&mdash;"and quite possibly his
wildcard Ice Assassins actually <em>were</em> helping you somewhat."
His expression soured even further, but he forced the next words out.
"Also, you're good at what you do."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht smiled sunnily, recognizing just how much that had cost
Thomas to say.  "Thank you, I try."
</p>

<p>
I cocked my head in thought.  "Huh.  You know, I think we're looking
at this wrong.  We shouldn't be going after Af&mdash;Melvin, we should
be going after the Death God.  The trick is going to be to get into
his presence without getting squashed like a bug.  Any thoughts on how
we do that?"
</p>

<p>
"Well..." Drifa said thoughtfully.  "When seeking parley, I believe
it's traditional to look for a herald, and a champion.  Lady
Herr&uacute;n would make an excellent champion, once the ritual is
finished."
</p>

<p>
"Yeah, how's that going?" I asked in curiosity.
</p>

<p>
She didn't quite shrug, but nearly.  "I haven't checked on it today;
I've been busy with other things.  Let's go see."
</p>

<p>
And so we dropped the subject of killing the God of Death and
destroying the undead High King of the Lich Kings who was unbelievably
overpowered in the magical, military, and apparently economic arenas.
Instead, we headed for the door to see how we were doing at
resurrecting a goddess who'd been dead for twice as long as the
Earth's recorded history.

</p>
<p>
"In a society without death, Ingfred is 20 years old and has no
prospects. All the good jobs are filled by undying masters of their
craft, and it's hard to be taken seriously when you are, compared to
everyone around you, an infant.  Fortunately, he has a solution:
undergo an illegal transformation and sell the memory to The

There's two problems: how can Ingfred convince a powerful wizard to
risk his mage license and his freedom to help with such a crazy plan?
And, once that's done...how will Ingfred deal with the law?"
