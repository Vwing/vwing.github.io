<p>
"...I Wish I were smarter," I gasped for the fifth time, struggling to
get the words out before time resumed.
</p>

<p>
The wave hit me, far harder than last time, but I was confident. Now
that I'd been through it once, I had techniques in place for managing
the experience of having my brain yanked open and extra neurons jammed
in, or whatever it was that this magical intellect-expansion did.
Also, the increased brainpower that I had obtained from the Earring of
Intellect gave me more processing power and more storage to help
manage the flood of
<em>new</em> intellect.  
</p>

<p>
Oh boy, was I ever wrong.
</p>

<p> I fought with the experience, struggling to master my new mind
<em>
(mentation (mentality (mentat (eyebrows) (sapho juice) (desert
(dessert (chocolate)) (Eagle) (island (Gilligan))))))</em> quickly <em>(quick
like a bunny (Playboy bunny) (bunnies are fast (I hate fasting

fools (in motley (crue (crewcut (cut(up (standup (for your rights))) (down not

</em>
</p>

<p>
I yanked my thoughts sideways from their useless
wheel-spinning <em>(James Dean chicken fight (no bullets))</em> and
into more productive <em>(production (capacity (carrying capacity
(total life support)))</em> channels.  For too long now, I'd been
having all these odd feelings, this sense that I was missing
something. What had caused

unshattered into my mind, painting itself on my mind's eye for a
nanosecond before the chaotic tumble of my new brain disintegrated it
into monatomic dust <em>(dirt (mop (mom (moan (mine (mane (male (mal
(captain (firefly (glowworm (ladybug (spots (shell) (spot (dog (cat

</p>

<p>I roared in fury at my runaway <em>(out of control (panel (of

could properly see <em>(taste (touch (smell (stink (stunk (stank (tank

time)))</em> it and punched the wooden floor, hard, over and over,
matching bone and sinew against knotty oak in an effort to pull myself
out of the mental tsunami.  My knuckles split, blood spattered
everywhere, but I tried to shut everything out and just focus on the
pain <em>Payne-pine-(scent | tree | away)&mdash;</em> Damnit, I almost
had it there and then it slipped <em>(sliding away ((over yonder) (in

</p>

<p>
Snarling in rage and fear and frustration, I reared up and slammed my
head into the wall, trying to smash out the madness that was searing
my brain, club the craziness unconscious against the elegant carvings
of the Temple of Ilara.  My forehead split, blood gushed into my eyes,
and I heard my nose break.  For a split second, everything whited out
in a blinding flash of sensation too intense to be called merely pain.
When it faded, I was left with stars dancing before my eyes blocking
my entire field of vision. Agony split whatever part of my skull
wasn't already cracked, knocking me down and leaving me curled up in a
whimpering fetal ball.  It was an acceptable price.  What mattered was
that the pain and blood did their job: they shocked my brain quiet for
just a moment, giving me one precious instant of stillness inside my
poor battered skull to shore up my defenses before the tidal bore of
enhancement slammed over me again.
</p>

<p>
When the runaway word associations (<em>homeowners, Computing
Machinery, American Medical</em>) and spinning imagery (<em>I was
burnt (toast (and eggs (and bacon (generator (Plaza)))))) to death,
bits breaking off as Thomas carried my dead bodies of the tens of
thousands I had pulverized, shattered, shredded, flayed</em>) hit, I
forced them aside, clinging to one
thought.  <em>~I <strong>must</strong> have this under control before
the Landguard unfreeze!  Can't let them know, can't let it show, can't
let them see (sense (sensory (extrasensory (extraterrestrial (inhuman
(inorganic (chemistry) (synthetic (fibres) (intelligence) (synthesis

(hemophiliac<strong>~NO! THIS IS MY MIND AND YOU WILL
STOP!~</strong>))))))))))))))</em> I didn't even know who I
was screaming at, here in the dark cavern <em>(cave (of Plato))</em>
of my thoughts.  Perhaps noone, <em>(nothing (null (none
(nonesuch<strong>~NO!~</strong>))))</em> perhaps I just needed to
engage the fight / flight circuits <em>(transistors (vacuum
tubes<strong>~NO!~</strong>))</em> to bring all the parts of my mind
together and focus <em>(foci (parallel
(parallax<strong>~NO!~</strong>)))</em> on an imagined
enemy <em>(antagonist (nemesis (foe (fie fee
fum<strong>~NO!~</strong>))))</em> that represented the runaway
processes of my id <em>((ego (superego)) (freudian
symbology<strong>~NO!  FOCUS!~</strong>))</em>
</p>

<p>
I felt hands on me, rolling me over.  I lashed out, thrashing with
fists and feet at whomever, whatever it was <em>(were (we (we're
(where (wear (were-bear (can't bear it<strong><em>~STOP!
FOCUS!~</em></strong>)))))))</em> that was touching me.  Between the
stars and the blood in my eyes, I couldn't see anything, but I wasn't
ready <em>(willing and able)</em> to face <em>(visage (vision
(envision<strong><em>~NO!  FOCUS!~</em></strong>)))</em> the world
<em>(planet (earth (terra (terabyte (terrible bite (tribble
bite<strong><em>~STOP! STAY FOCUSED~</em></strong>))))))</em>.
</p>

<p>
My arms were grabbed and forcibly pinned to the floor above my head
<em>(skull (cabeza (cabbage (kimchee (in deep (dire (wolf) (dark
(dank<strong><em>~STOP!~</em></strong>)))))))</em>. I needed to focus,
I had been wrong, this was so much harder than the first time, I had
pushed too far, too hard <em>(diamond is a 10 on the Mohs scale),</em>
too fast, too soon, too much <em>(of a good Thing (It's Clobberin'

to be this large, contain this much, move this fast, I was like a
computer <em>((laptop) (desktop) (machine) (box) (server) (embedded

</p>

<p>
"Let him go, it's making it worse!  Back off, everyone!"  The
hands <em>(of time (Lord (Ten, definitely Ten) (Run!) (Rose(s are red,
violets are blue, I turned my brain to pudding and so can
you))))</em> pulled away, leaving me free to thrash for a moment
longer and then curl back into my fetal ball again, screaming and
clutching my head where the fire and the molten lead and the snowbats
and the gazelles leapt and soared and drank majorly mossy mojitos at
midnight while decisively devising derisive disparagements to awkward
awks that purled pearls and gulped and guzzled gravitas-greedy Greek
glass grass glider pumpkin popping punks as they gyred and japed at
jalapeno bicycles&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Bob, put him out!" shouted a voice that I vaguely remembered...a man?
Human? Something....
</p>

<p>
Someone muttered and I slept.
</p>

<center>o-o-o-o</center>

<p>
I awoke suddenly, but managed to keep still and keep my eyes closed
while I figured out where I was.  The surface under me was
familiar&mdash;soft, satin sheets, pillows, clearly my own bed.  I
heard faint noises of people nearby, slight metallic noises that were
probably armor clinking as the wearers shifted their weight.  Back in
my own room, then.  And, as always, surrounded by Landguard.
</p>

<p>
While I slept, my mind had managed to integrate itself.  There was no
more overpowering rush of associations / sensations / memories, just
cool stillness and a feeling of power ready to my hand, straining to
be used, like being at the controls of a heavily armed fly-by-wire jet
fighter.  Nothing hurt, so presumably I had been the beneficiary of
their healing paladin hands&mdash;or perhaps a Landguard cleric had
used regular healing magic.  Whatever.  My nose was no longer broken,
my ankle didn't hurt, there was nothing to distract me.
</p>

<p>
Best of all, they thought I was still asleep, so I had some time to
think.
</p>

<p>
I had wanted to get the extra brainpower without the Landguard knowing
about it; there were too many strange things that I noticed from the
corner of my mental eye lately.  I needed an edge, something no one
else knew about, that would let me figure out what was happening.  In
the meantime, I would need an explanation for why I was seizing back
at the temple.  A moment's consideration gave me one: the encounter
with Ilara.
</p>

<p>
Eyes still closed, being careful not to change my breathing, I
scrolled back through my memories, looking for that flash of insight I
had had.
</p>

<p>
It was gone.  Completely and utterly.
</p>

<p>
<em>~Fine.  I figured it out once, I'll do it again.  I'll just have
to do it the hard way,~</em> I growled to myself.  Painstakingly, I
started flipping through everything I remembered, moving farther and
farther back in time, trying to isolate the moments when something
seemed odd.
</p>

<p>
There were a lot of them.
</p>

<p>
<em>It was rather like having all of Delta Force escort the head of
the high school Dungeons and Dragons club to homecoming.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>I started having flashbacks to high school, being the twiggy nerd
that suddenly found himself surrounded by all the football jocks.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>A dagger appeared in Thomas's free hand, the point about a
nanometer from my eyeball...and I started pondering the quality and
sharpness of the dagger, not the fact that he was about to kill
me.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Loki appeared before me and some small corner of my mind
muttered <em>~I'm not terrified.  How odd.~</em></em>
</p>

<p>
<em>
That little voice in the back of my head said ~Do not taunt Happy Fun
Trickster God, for he is subtle and quick to zot.~ I ignored it.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>
Loki shrugged and grinned, not bothered in the slightest. "Hey,
slapstick is a time-honored tradition in humor. Just ask the Stooges."
I frowned. "The who?"</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>I wasn't actually afraid of who- or whatever this was, but a
significant degree of caution seemed called for around anything that
could suddenly appear in the middle of my magically shielded bedroom
in the middle of my heavily defended castle while putting my highly
lethal bodyguard into a literal time out.</em>  
</p>

<p>
<em>Olivia had just a trace of an accent that stretched the 'o's out
and put the emphasis on odd silly bobbles; I kept trying to figure out
what it reminded me of, and it was driving me crazy that I
couldn't.</em>  And yet, my memory was so good that I could
re-experience the taste of a specific cheese at will, as I well
remembered.
</p>

<p>
<em>
Experimentally, I reached for some of my farther-back memories for
details from years ago. I needed something highly precise, like the
taste of the cheese that Suze had served me for supper on my first
day...now that I thought about it, yes, I could relive that cheese in
all its delicious glory. Just like I could remember the exact
stippling on the cannon we hid behind at the test shoot, from where
fragments of the failed cannon had slammed into it.
</em> The memories were precise, but none of them were from before I
came to Flobovia, much less from "years ago."
</p>

<p>
A quick review showed lots of times when I had had thoughts from my
own world, but none of them were personal. Occasional pop culture
references, physics, chemistry...but nothing about my life, or my
family.  Even the ones that were only glancingly related to my
life&mdash;like the idea of a Dungeons and Dragons club, as opposed to
simply remembering the game existed&mdash;felt strange, wrong
somehow.  <em>~Hypothesis: something is blocking my ability to access
personal memories.~</em>
</p>

<p>
No, wait, there were some. 
</p>

<p>
<em>...goodbye keep waving until we're out of sight what a wonderful
Christmas I love that house it's so warm and cozy and beautful and
everything is so tasteful...
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>
...full of the taste of Thanksgiving: creamed spinach and pearled
onions and squash and cranberry sauce with the ridges they have the
fresh stuff but I like the ridges and the turkey is a bit too dry and
oh no I'm stuck next to Uncle Joe god he's boring oh well I'll
manage...
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>
...a team of programmers my job to shield them from management so they
can actually get work done and things are great with Bill but not so
much with Anita even though she's got skills she's prickly and I try
to smooth things over...
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>
...head compartments by me are full darnit I'll have to put my bag
four seats back and that means waiting forever to get off the plane oh
well whinging about it isn't helpful...
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>
...to everyone, that's just who she is, all the time Nellie is always
helping someone but this isn't her dream job her dream job was to be a
counselor although she's amazing where she works it's her dream but
she doesn't want to do a Ph.D. and I can't blame her...
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>
...for any of it because I took her for granted and it's my own stupid
fault...
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>
...lines in California are everywhere more of them than you can shake
a stick at and it's kinda crazy living here and it's true it's like a
bowl of granola lots of nuts and flakes....
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Hadn't Mr Strunk, my seventh grade English teacher, pounded the
rule of "never use a long word where a diminutive one will fit" into
me?</em>
</p>

<p>
Those were all actual, personal memories; did they invalidate the
hypothesis?  ...Perhaps.  But they were all from one block of time,
immediately after I put on the Headband of Intellect, when my brain
would have been most scrambled, when I was actively sorting memories,
and my intelligence and memory were artificially boosted.
</p>

<p>
Was I making excuses, attempting to rationalize a pet theory?
Unclear.  Tag this for later examination and continue.
</p>

<p>
<em>With just a thought I could relive the experience of appearing
in the Work Room, talking with Albrecht, eating cheese and fruit in
the sitting room, meeting Allison, meeting the Conclave, my various
sessions with Duncan...every moment clear, sharp.</em>  Again, no
personal memories there, nothing from before my kidnapping.
</p>

<p>
I noticed that the term 'kidnapping' felt uncomfortable.  My brain
kept trying to substitute 'arrival', but I wouldn't let it.  Add that
to the evidence list.
</p>

<p>
<em>
Seriously, in what weird-ass universe would someone tell you that
your opponent had casually dropped a superspell in front of you...and
then you just shrugged it off and went on with your day?
</em> In what universe <em>would</em> that happen?  Perhaps one in
which the people in question didn't want me thinking too much about
powerful, unfamiliar spells?  I had already noticed that the
Brainopedia was not complete and not always correct.  There could be
something I hadn't been told about that modified memory.
</p>

<p>
<em>"I'm...not sure our duty allows us to surrender," Thomas said
regretfully. "All of our military, and probably many of the regular
citizens, would be drafted into their army and sent off to fight evil
undead. All of those people are part of the Land, and them being sent
to kill or be turned into monsters is not a fate we can permit."  I
shrugged.  "Ok, good enough."</em>  Why had I accepted that so easily?
It was clear that surrendering to Anundj&aring; would be the best
thing for the people of Flobovia, and probably for me personally.  Why
didn't I argue?  That wasn't like me...I didn't think.  I was pretty
sure that I'd always been firm in my convictions.
</p>

<p>
I had more of these memories of oddness, but this seemed like a good
enough sampling for now.  Was there anything else that was really
critical, that was qualitatively different from the ones I'd already
viewed?
</p>

<p>
<em>For a moment, I felt an instinctive desire to ask for advice
from...someone....</em>  Perhaps a mentor?  A teacher?  Or.... My
brain lurched for a moment, like a car being dragged through the gears
with no clutch.  Perhaps I had wanted to ask advice from a parent?  I
reached for memories of my parents; there weren't any.  None.  Not a
wisp.  Their faces, their names, nothing.  Ditto for siblings,
grandparents, cousins...nothing.  All of my memories of my family
were <em>gone</em>.  Ice cold lava began to trickle out of my heart,
and I had to stop thinking for ten or twenty seconds and focus on
keeping my breathing even, my muscles untensed.  Remember, O Landguard
protectors, jailors, traitors, I am still asleep.  Stand your guard
and notice nothing.  Do not notice the hate that burns through me.  Do
not notice me planning your total destruction.
</p>

<p>
Was that fair?  Were the Landguard definitely complicit?  This had to
have been done by magic, which almost certainly meant the
Archmagi...or, maybe...could it be a side effect of the summoning
spell, something intended to make it easier for the kidnapped ruler to
be happy during his reign?  Perhaps there was no conscious intent here
at all, perhaps it wasn't even something the Flobovians knew about.
Perhaps all my memories would be restored when I was sent home.
</p>

<p>
I spent ninety-three seconds running multiple predictive simulations
in my head as to how likely it was that the Archmagi didn't know of
this effect, or couldn't do anything about it and therefore chose not
to mention it so as to ease my situation.  Every single one of those
scenarios said "snowball in hell."
</p>

<p>
<em>~What about the Landguard?  They aren't spellcasters, so maybe
they weren't involved, or didn't understand what was being done. No,
wait, apparently Bob can cast Sleep, so he's got some caster levels.
Rob and Bob from Alpha Squad were introduced as "Healer Specialist",
which probably means "cleric," and Mage Specialist, which probably
means "wizard," so apparently some or all of the Landguard are
multi-classed, which means they might well have known, or at least
understood.~</em> Hm.  Was there anything that spoke to this issue,
one way or the other?
</p>

<p>
<em>"Thomas, whatever you think you remember, it's a lie. That isn't
the way history really is. It's like some magic spell planted false
memories in your head." Thomas flashed a glance at me, eyes wide, and
then his expression vanished into his usual blank professional mask.
</em>
</p>

<p>
Son of a bitch.  The bastard knew.
</p>

<p>
I sat and seethed, struggling not to throw myself off the bed and
gouge Thomas's eyes out right then and there.  <em>~There are three
reasons not to do it,~</em> I told myself coldly.  <em>~and only one
reason <strong>to</strong> do it.  Reasons why I should not: first, I
probably couldn't; even without the other Landguard present, Thomas is
more than a match for me physically.  Second, it would make no
difference; a strong enough cleric could use the Regenerate
spell&mdash;</em> A quick flip through the Brainopedia told me that
yes, it really did exist as I remembered it from my long-ago
Dungeons-and-Dragons-playing days.  <em>&mdash;could use the
Regenerate spell to restore Thomas's eyes, just as Duke Frederick's
bones were flawlessly healed after I had Duncan crush them.  Most
important, however, is that it would tip my hand.  Right now, they
know what they did to me and I know what they did to me, but I also
know that they don't know that I know what they did to me.~</em>
</p>

<p>
I considered all of that starkly, then forced myself to choke down the
rage and finish the thought.  <em>~That's three good reasons not to
gouge Thomas's eyes out, and the only reason <strong>to</strong> do it
is that it would be very satisfying.~</em>
</p>

<p>
I frowned at that thought, but managed to keep the frown purely
internal.
</p>

<p>
<em>~It would be <strong>satisfying</strong> to gouge a man's eyes
out?~</em> I considered that carefully.  Would Suze find that
satisfying?  No.  Would any of the Archmagi?  Probably not.  Duke
Frederick?...most likely no.  He was an arrogant jackass and a bully,
but I'd seen no indications that he enjoyed causing pain.
</p>

<p>
Was 'finding the idea of maiming a fellow human satisfying', in fact,
a normal thing?  Would the average citizen in the street feel that
way?
</p>

<p>
I had to consider that one.  The provocation was quite extreme, of
course; the Archmagi, Thomas, all of the Landguard in fact, has taken
my entire <em>life</em> away from me.  And blinding, especially if it
could be rendered permanent and un-healable, was the sort of
punishment that would keep others in line so that more extreme
measures were not required.  It could be argued that burning out the
eyes of one or two, or a couple dozen, would prevent the need to
execute many others.  Surely that was a moral good?
</p>

<p>
I thought about it.  Carefully.
</p>

<p>
Eventually I came to the conclusion that I didn't know the answer.  I
wasn't too bothered by that...but what I <strong>was</strong> bothered
by is that I wasn't bothered by not being able to judge a question of
moral goodness.
</p>

<p>
<em>~Was I always like this, or is this new, is this something they
did to me?~</em> I wondered.  A quick flip through my memories
answered the question pretty unambiguously.
</p>

<p>
<em>~My second day here, I was so rattled by a Conclave
meeting&mdash;a purely verbal confrontation&mdash;that Thomas had
Duncan start working with me on 'confidence building'.  I haven't felt
fear since that night, my second night here.  No, wait, that's not
right.  I did feel fear twice: when Loki exerted himself to terrify
me, and when Ilara did it while holding me against the wall.  In
short, when I arriv&mdash;when I was kidnapped here, a Duke and some
other glorified bureacrats were enough to frighten me, at least
somewhat.  After my second night, it required a
literal <strong>god</strong> to frighten me.  A god who was
explicitly <strong>trying</strong> to frighten me.~
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>~When I had Duncan attack Duke Frederick, I had to spend
significant time psyching myself up, analyzing all the various
possible outcomes of our interaction and mentally preparing for them.
I remember thinking that my plan to crush old Freddy's hand was
'nothing I would have dreamed of in my own world.'  Now I'm completely
unfazed by the thought of gouging a man's eyes out?~</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>~After I bombarded the Deorsi, I threw up.  Earlier today I
figured out how to annihilate their entire army in the span of a few
seconds, and my only concern was that I needed to figure out how to do
it without upsetting the Landguard.~</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>~All things considered, I am going to have to say 'no, it is not
normal for me that the idea of maiming someone fails to disturb my
calm.'~</em>
</p>

<p>
So, what exactly did I know?  Clearly, some magic had been used on me
to rewire my brain&mdash;erase memories, remove my capacity for fear,
make me more ruthless.  It had almost certainly been done by the
Archmagi&mdash;the original Archmagi: Isaac, Reynard, and Matthew, not
the new Archmagi (whoever they were).  What about my willingness to
accept Thomas's assessment that we couldn't surrender?...was that a
pre-programmed obedience to Thomas in particular, or a newly-installed
desire to defend Flobovia (which was still a stupid name, damnit!), or
something else?
</p>

<p>
Most importantly, of course&mdash;did I like these changes?
Ruthlessnes and fearlessness were undoubtedly useful traits in the
situation I currently faced.  Even if I could find a way to go back to
my old self, would I want to?
</p>

<p>
I thought about that one good and hard, and finally decided I did want
to go back.  Fear might be uncomfortable, but it existed for a
reason&mdash;it was a primary survival mechanism.  Lacking it made me
more likely to die, which seemed like a highly suboptimal outcome.
Ruthlessness was useful, but my orbital strike against the Deorsi, as
well my ability to have Frederick's hand crushed, showed that my
original self could be ruthless when he needed to be...he just had to
choose to be.  Also, it seemed to me that my old self had not had
difficulty with moral judgements.  Amorality was useful in the short
term, but in the long term it interfered with the ability to have
meaningful relationships with other humans.  I remembered believing
that those were important, back before my brain got stirred with a
potato masher.  I decided to trust my pre-modification judgement and
continue thinking they were important, even though I wasn't one
hundred percent certain why.
</p>

<p>
The means to undo this was obvious, but it left me with a dilemna; if
any of the Landguard or the original Archmagi knew that I had broken
their mind mojo, they would just put it back.  I would need to find a
pretext to be alone for a few minutes at some point soon, and that was
going to be difficult, given how paranoid Thomas was being. And I had
to get it right the first time; this wasn't a trick I could do more
than once.  (At least, not without a lot more preparation than seemed
practical.)
</p>

<p>
Speaking of preparation, what about my remaining Wishes?  I still had
one Wish left from the first ring, and three left on the third ring.
I knew what I had to do with the three; I would keep the one hidden as
my reserve.
</p>

<p>
<em>~I wonder if I could use a Wish to send myself home?  And if I
could, are there any magical items, monetary wealth, or special powers
that I could bring with me?  If I could use some of the Wishes to give
myself Heal, or Prestidigitation, or Detect Thoughts, as an at-will
special ability, I could write my own ticket back home.  Shoot, go all
the way and give myself Wish as a special ability.  Except that might
break that "no Wishing for more Wishes" Edict of 'The True God'.~</em>
Even in my thoughts I couldn't resist putting quotes and a slight
sneer on the title.  Shailos, as he was apparently named, was
definitely more than a little egotistical.
</p>

<p>
And speaking of egotistical, I finally saw a way out of my current
mess.  It just relied on me being glib enough to convince Thomas to do
something he was going to really, <em>really</em> not want to do: give
me a little space.  Fortunately, I was pretty sure I knew how to do
it.  And I wouldn't even have to lie, which was important. It seemed
very likely that Thomas or one of the magi was monitoring me for
truthfulness in order to detect whether or not I had broken the
mind-whammy.  Hmm...how could I test that?  Ah, of course.
</p>

<p>
So.  Priorities: Kill original Archmagi.  Kill Deorsi army if
necessary. Mend fences with the Archpriest in order to prevent him
from undermining my power or causing trouble that would be
distracting.  Prepare to have him killed if fences couldn't be mended.
Undo mind whammy.  Kill Landguard.  Kill all family members of
Landguard and original Archmagi so that I never had to have the
"Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya" conversation.
</p>

<p>
I figured the first four I could probably get done today, but the rest
would take a few days, and would probably need to be reordered.  I
would keep them as stretch goals, though.  And I would have cake to
celebrate if I got through that much of my todo list today.
</p>

<p>
With all the pieces in place, I stirred a bit as though just waking
up, then sat up and stretched, faking a yawn.  Immediately Thomas was
at my side; the rest of the Landguard remained facing outwards.
Always the consummate bodyguards, maintaining situational awareness at
all times.
</p>

<p>
I took a moment to look at my protective detail.  Thomas, Duncan,
Alpha Squad&mdash;Robert, Rob, Bob, and Aerith&mdash;plus Franklin.
Franklin was the only surprise; best guess, Thomas had been impressed
enough with his contributions to the earlier war council that he had
promoted the kid onto Alpha Squad.  Of course all of them had steel in
hand.
</p>

<p>
"Did someone get the license plate of that truck that hit me?" I
asked.  I chuckled and looked at Thomas, painting a smile on my face
and shaking my head a bit with fake chagrin.  "Hot tip: do not piss
off a goddess.  She didn't even have to hit me, her 'angry voice' was
enough to scramble my brains but good."  I grinned ruefully.  It was
true; Ilara's rage had left me terrified and nearly incoherent. On the
other hand, it was also a misleading phrasing...and deliberately so.
</p>

<p>
Thomas swallowed it hook, line, and sinker.  Good; if he <em>was</em>
the one with the lie-detector, it apparently didn't detect that my
feelings and my words were out of alignment, or that I had phrased my
words to give the false impression that Ilara had caused my seizure,
not a secret flurry of intelligence-enhancing Wishes.  If it didn't
catch misleading statements then it probably wouldn't catch lies of
omission either.  I was going to need that leeway.  Of course, it was
also possible that it <em>wasn't</em> Thomas who had the lie detector;
it could have been another member of my bodyguard, or one of the magi.
The latter seemed unlikely though; they would want me under full-time
monitoring, and none of them were in the room.
</p>

<p>
"How are you feeling?" Thomas asked worriedly.
</p>

<p>
I shrugged.  "I'm fine now.  Whatever you guys did, all the damage is
gone and I feel great.  Also, sleeping seems to have jarred a few
things loose; I have some ideas on how to handle the Deorsi.  I'm
pretty sure that I can get Albrecht to turn on his own people."
</p>

<p>
Thomas blinked at that, shocked.  Several members of Alpha Squad
turned around and gaped for just a moment before remembering their
duty and snapping back to face out.
</p>

<p>
"How in the world can you do that?!"  Thomas demanded incredulously.
</p>

<p>
I smiled, waggling a finger at him.  "Ah ah ah.  Don't ruin the
surprise." I carefully stitched a pensive expression on my face.  "I
just wish I knew if Albrecht was truthful about everything he said.  I
think I know which parts were true and which weren't, but this whole
idea hinges on it, and I can't be completely confident that I'm
right."
</p>

<p>
Thomas responded without thinking. "He had some sort of mind blank
magic in place, but his body language said that most of it was true.
There were a couple of places where I wasn't sure, but I don't know
the man well enough to be certain."
</p>

<p>
I nodded thoughtfully, ruthlessly surpressing my surge of delight at
how easily Thomas had fallen for that.  Set him up with a big shock,
knock him down with a leading statement to draw out the fact that the
lie detector existed.
</p>

<p>
I shrugged casually.  "Well, doesn't matter.  Either way, we'll make
it work.  We're going to need some help, though."
</p>

<p>
For several seconds Thomas kept gaping at me, mouth hanging open,
still trying to process the hope that had flared when I said that
maybe I could solve all this.  Finally his jaw snapped shut and he
blinked back into being the decisive leader.  "Right.  Who do you
need?"
</p>

<p>
I made a pretense of thinking about it.  "The three new Archmagi and
previous-Archmage Isaac.  Hm.  A couple of cooks.  Oh, and I need a
tent.  A big one. And some chairs."
</p>

<p>
He raised an eyebrow and then shrugged.  "Franklin, go."  Franklin was
out the door like a shot.
</p>

<p>
I slipped off the bed and headed for the bathroom.  "I need a shower,"
I tossed over my shoulder.  "Apparently, getting knocked around by an
angry goddess makes a guy sweaty."
</p>

<p>
The Landguard were trailing after me like ducklings following their
mother.  Just as expected.
</p>

<p>
I turned back to them, frowning.  "Guys, look.  I understand you need
to protect me, but this is nuts.  I need some privacy sometimes.  I'm
an introvert at heart; I get rattled and don't think as well if I
don't have at least <em>some</em> time to myself.  Also, having
someone in the shower with me is embarrassing.  Wait here."
</p>

<p>
Every single one of their faces turned mulish and Thomas shook his
head.  "You cannot be left alone.  So it is Writ.  And even if it were
not, I <strong>will not</strong> risk your life again."
</p>

<p>
I sighed.  "Look, we're in the most heavily defended room of the most
heavily defended building in the entire country.  If I'm not safe
here, then I'm not safe anywhere.  Does the Writ say that you have to
be <em>actually in the room with me</em> at all times?  If you stand
here, and I'm ten feet away in the shower, within easy
calling-for-help range, is that good enough?"  I sighed again, and let
a bit of wheedling leech into my tone.  "Seriously, I need some space.
Allison will be in there with me, so I won't be alone.  And, to be
honest, she's embarrassing enough.  Cut me some slack here, ok?"
</p>

<p>
He pondered it, clearly struggling between his newly-escalated
paranoia and his desire to keep me in peak form.  Finally he came to a
decision.  "Fine," he said with an expression like he just bit a
lemon.  "But if anything even <strong>remotely</strong> strange
happens, call us immediately."
</p>

<p>
I smiled, and this time I didn't have to force it.  Sucker.  "No
problemo, amigo.  Should so much as a mouse move incorrectly, there
will be one very loud shrieking-for-help-like-a-little-girl Jake in
that shower."  I turned back to the bathroom door.  "Come on, Allison,
I'd really like to keep my 'man-grapes', as you call them, on the
outside of my body."  She laughed but left the fireplace and drifted
after me through the air.
</p>

<p>
"Oh and, Thomas?  Call a Conclave meeting for dinner time tonight.  I
need to eat some crow with the Archpriest."  I vanished inside,
looking forward to the bliss of hot water...albeit not so much to the
embarrassment caused by a snarky fire elemental.
</p>

<center>o-o-o-o</center>

<p>
"This will work, right?  You don't need to be familiar with the thing
to use it as a Polymorph result?"  I really hoped I was right or this
was going to be very embarrassing.  And I'd be very frustrated at the
foiling of my assassination plan.
</p>

<p>
Isaac nodded his head portentously.  "Correct, My Lord.  The arcane
matrix of a Polymorph Any Object spell is constructed using a Kafkan
transformation field interleaved with a Delphic information-gathering
matrix, similar to the one used for Scrying and related mystic
constructs.  The fields combine to form a proto-sentience that is
capable of gathering the requisite datum or data required to satisfy
the form provided by the field constructor regardless of&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Excellent!  Isaac, you're a miracle worker," I told him, clapping him
on the shoulder and giving a wide smile.  Mostly to cut off the verbal
mudslide, but also because I was honestly delighted.  Seemed like this
was going to work after all.
</p>

<p>
Isaac frowned at me.  "I beg to differ, My Lord.  Clerics," he sniffed
disdainfully, "perform miracles, using the powers that are <em>gifted
to them</em>"&mdash;a derisive sniff&mdash;"by their gods.  I am a
wizard.  We do not perform miracles, we alter the world through hard
work informed by detailed research that gives us an unmatched
understanding of the deep structure of mystic energies and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I hurried to cut him off again.  "Of course, my apologies.  Isaac, I
have a very, very important task that needs to get done, and you're
the best man for the job.  I'd like you to&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He cut me off in turn, his eyes drifting over my shoulder to where the
new Archmagi waited a few yards away; his lip curled up in thinly
veiled anger and contempt as he did.  "Why would you ask me, My Lord?
Wouldn't it be better to have one of these <em>new</em> Archmagi
handle whatever is so important?  After all, aren't they now the best
magi in the nation?"  Isaac might be a fantastically powerful wizard,
but he was craptastic at hiding his feelings. If looks could kill, the
three new Archmagi would be smoking craters in the ground.
</p>

<p>
Come to think of it, when it comes to wizards, sometimes
looks <em>could</em> kill.  I decided it might be a good time to wrap
things up.
</p>

<p>
I glanced over my shoulder at the newbies and then leaned in close,
whispering conspiratorially.  "Them?  Fah.  They might have the
levels, but they sure don't have the experience.  They wouldn't be
able to handle something this important.  No, you're definitely the
man for the job.  This has to be kept absolutely secret.  From
everyone&mdash;the Deorsi could be magically spying on us right now.
They could try to follow whoever I send and attack him.  To work
properly, they need to be surprised by this.  If they are, it could
end the war right there.  Now, remind me, when something is hit with
Polymorph Any Object like this, how long does it retain the new form?"
</p>

<p>
Isaac got that excited oh-good-I-get-to-lecture gleam in his eye as he
started in.  "The duration is a function of several variables, My
Lord.  The change in size, the change in type, the similarity between
the source object and the product.  The duration function consists
of&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What's the shortest duration?" I hurriedly asked.  
</p>

<p>
He sniffed slightly, irked at having his lecture cut short.  "Even
with the greatest divergence between source and product, the Kafkan
field will sustain itself for at least twenty minutes, although I've
been working on a theory&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Isaac, you're brilliant!" I told him, grinning like an idiot.
"Twenty minutes is more than enough time."  In point of fact a
millisecond was more than enough time, but I needed to throw out some
red herrings.  "Ok, take this," I handed him a heavy bag and a piece
of paper. (I had been delighted to discover that whatever magic
translated my words also translated my writing.  To have this all fall
apart because of something as ridiculous as illiteracy would have been
humiliating.)
</p>

<p>
"Read the paper," I told him, leaning in close and speaking intently
to show how important this was.  "but make sure you keep it covered
while you do&mdash;can't let any spies see it.  There's a location on
it, and the name of what I want you to Polymorph this bag into.
Teleport to that location and wait there until you get a Sending from
me.  When I contacted him an hour ago, Albrecht agreed to a parley.
The location I'm sending you to is a little way away from the parley
site.  When the right moment comes, I'll use Sending to contact you.
When you get it, cast the Polymorph Any Object on the bag and teleport
away immediately.  Ok?  And remember&mdash;this deed will make your
name live forever.  It'll change the entire course of the parley, and
it could potentially end the entire war, right then and there.  And
there's no one else I'd rather have to do this than you."  I was being
very careful not to lie; used differently, this could indeed have been
enough to end the war.  I just didn't intend to use it that way.  And
Isaac was definitely the person I most wanted to do this.
</p>

<p>
He drew himself a little straighter and puffed out his scrawny chest.
"I won't let you down, My Lord!"  Carefully holding the paper in his
cupped hands he opened them just enough to read what was written.
With a firm nod and something that was probably intended to be a
salute, he said "Greater Teleport" and vanished.
</p>

<p>
I had my back to everyone else, so I allowed myself a cruel grin.  I
did in fact plan to eliminate the traits that had been forced on me,
but sometimes ruthlessness and amorality were <em>so</em> handy.
</p>

<center>o-o-o-o</center>

<p>
Twenty minutes later, I waited in a field near the southwest corner of
the Senis Hills.  To the north and east, there was about a mile of
clear land and then the ground started to look weird.  Some of it
glowed, some of it looked like cottage cheese and, as I watched, some
of it <em>got up and walked away.</em>  Apparently there was a reason
that no one went into the Senis Hills.
</p>

<p>
To the west loomed the Carrsian Mountain range, the source of the
rivers that fed the Carr Fens.  Even now, in mid-summer, some of the
mountains were snow-capped.  They stretched out of sight in both
directions, like the spine of some enormous bluish-purple dragon.  A
mile or so to the south of our position lay a small forest.  Not more
than a mile long and only half that deep, but quite scenic.  This was
a lovely spot; I was glad we'd managed to pick it off the low-quality
Flobovian maps.
</p>

<p>
With a soft pop! Albrecht and his bodyguard appeared a few hundred
yards away.  He was smiling widely and looking as ebullient as ever,
but his bodyguard were about as comfortable as a herd of cats in a dog
pound.  A dog pound for military attack dogs.  Giant ones.  With
rabies.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht closed the distance with a jaunty step, enthusiasm almost
visibly dragging his grumpy-looking companions after him.
</p>

<p>
He came right up to me and was reaching for my hand with both of his
own, clearly intending to shake with great vigor and delight.  He was
cut off, however, when Thomas and Duncan took a half step forward on
either side of me.  They made the move look less hostile by bowing,
but their eyes  stayed fixed on the Anundj&aring;ns.  Kadja
immediately stepped in front of Albrecht, hands resting oh-so-casually
near the hilts of her weapons.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht met my gaze and we both rolled our eyes at the paranoia of
our respective protectors.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, I had fully expected this and had my counter ready.
"High Marshal, I offer you parley and peacebond.  I swear on my honor
and the honor of Flobovia"&mdash;I winced a little at the way the name
ruined the gravitas of my speech&mdash;"that no one here, nor anyone
over whom I have authority, shall offer harm to your or your
companions for the duration of our parley and one hour afterwards,
contingent on you swearing the same. Do you?"
</p>

<p>
He was nodding almost before I finished.  "Of course.  I swear the
same oath in return.  Let there be parley and peacebond."  His eyes
flicked over the people behind me.  "Let's see, Commander Thomas I'm
familiar with, of course.  And this must be the inimitable Sergeant
Duncan Maklud; surely there can be only one to match that glower!
Your reputation precedes you sir.  Quite a few of my men have had
nightmares about meeting you on the field again, after the drubbing
you gave us at the Plaza.  I hope there are no hard feelings?"  He
seemed sincerely concerned.
</p>

<p>
Duncan grunted, glaring at Albrecht's bodyguard.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht evidentally took that as agreement, because his smile never
slipped as he turned to the rest of my companions.  "Hm, let's see.
This must be the famed and feared Alpha Squad
themselves&mdash;Sergeant Greenlake, Healer Specialist Davidson, Mage
Specialist Guardson, and Guardian-First Aerith, yes?  I believe you go
by Robert, Rob, and Bob respectively, is that right?  If you'll
forgive me, it must be terribly inconvenient having three men in the
same squad who all share a name.  I salute you for managing, as well
as for your well-known martial skills.  The stories of your
performance at Landguard intake have been tremendous!  I've had a bard
reciting them at dinner the last week; several of my commanders have
been so enthralled they reminded me of my youngest sons, begging for
another bedtime story."  He chortled in the way of all proud fathers
everywhere.  Robert kept his serious-face in place, but his eyes
twinkled.  Aerith grinned outright.
</p>

<p>
As Albrecht swept his eyes over the rest of the guard, his eyebrows
went up.  "Ah!  The new Archmagi.  Let me see if I have it
right...Archmagi Johnathon Hall, Phillip Cooper, and Colin Nelson, am
I correct?"  The three looked surprised and stammered a bit.  Duncan
shot them a quelling glower and they snapped their jaws shut,
contenting themselves with nodding to confirm the identifications.
</p>

<p>
"And, hm...."  Albrecht eyed Franklin with curiousity, furrowing his
brow.  "Oh dear, how embarrassing.  I'm so terribly sorry sir, but I'm
afraid I can't match your face...I realize it's terribly rude of me
and I do apologize.  Albrecht L&ouml;fgren sir. May I have the honor?"
He bowed very slightly&mdash;more of a nod and a slight tilt of the
torso&mdash;and held it while he waited for Franklin's response.
</p>

<p>
Franklin blushed and looked at Thomas for direction.  Thomas just
nodded his head toward Albrecht with a "well, go on then" expression.
</p>

<p>
"Guardian-Fourth Franklin Marsholm of White Falls, sir.  An honor to
meet you, sir."  Franklin managed to stumble through the formula
without actually stammering, blushing beet red all the way up to the
tips of his ears.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht's smile got wider.  "Ah!  Such a pleasure.  Thank you so much
for your name, and I apologize again for the rudeness of my ignorance.
I shall endeavor to be more courteous on our next meeting."  He gave
another small and polite bow before looking around at the tent
behind me. In the shade beneath it perched an elaborately laid table,
two chairs, and the very same cherrywood credenza from which I had
eaten when I first arrived in the Work Room.  It was laid with a
sumptuous array of foods from fish to fowl to fine breads, with plenty
of fruits, vegetables, and cheeses on the side (but, I was happy to
have seen, none of that barnyardy cheese I had disliked so much).
</p>

<p>
Introductions done, I slid my arms through the gap between Thomas and
Duncan and pushed them gently aside so that I could walk through and
take Albrecht's hand.  His bodyguard bristled.  My bodyguard bristled.
Looks were thrown like daggers in both directions, and they all leaned
forward like the Sharks and the Jets gearing up for their big dance
fight.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht and I ignored them, smiling happily at each other.  He was
smiling because he thought I was about to have Flobovia join with
Anundj&aring;.  I was smiling because I was about to have
Anundj&aring; join with me.  Well, that was part of it anyway.  This
was something of a "multiple birds, one stone" party.
</p>

<p>
I laid a hand on Albrecht's shoulder and turned towards the mountains.
He casually raised a hand to prevent his bodyguard from taking my hand
off at the shoulder and then turned with me, curious.  As I planned,
he faced his subordinates for a moment as he turned.  Step one
complete: I had gotten Albrecht to 'turn on his own people.'
</p>

<p>
"High Marshall&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Please!  Do call me Albrecht.  Titles get so formal, don't you think?
Later on we can always lie and tell the chroniclers that we were
terribly stuffy and proper throughout this entire discussion."  He
nudged me in the ribs and winked.
</p>

<p>
I laughed with genuine pleasure.  I truly liked this man.  "Of course,
thank you.  And please, call me Jake.  Now, as I was
saying <em>Albrecht</em>, I have a lovely meal laid on for us, but I
wanted to show you something before we sit down...oh, don't be
surprised, there may be some noise."  I looked over my shoulder and
nodded to my chief protector.  "Thomas, if you please."
</p>

<p>
Thomas tapped his gauntlet and whispered; a ghost-sparrow flew off,
making a beeline for the tallest of the mountains in front of us.
</p>

<center>o-o-o-o</center>

<p>
Isaac Davidson, former Archmage of Flobovia, former member of the
Conclave of Lords, was cold.  Really cold.  He hadn't expected to need
Endure Elements today and hadn't had it memorized.  The top of Mount
Herabu was four feet deep in snow and the wind was howling.  He
huddled miserably in the lee of a rock, arms wrapped around himself,
hoping that his ruler would not keep him waiting long. He kept a
careful grip on the bag he had been given; it would not do to fail in
this duty for something as stupid as losing the object he was to
Polymorph.  He had carefully tucked the scrap of paper inside the bag
after memorizing the strange words written on it.  He had no idea what
they meant, but that didn't matter; they would suffice to collapse the
field function and reify the effect of the mystic construct.
</p>

<p>
While he waited, he warmed himself with the memory of his ruler
entrusting him&mdash;him!&mdash;with such a clearly important task,
and saying that he was the only man for the job.  <em>~No good for
anything, am I, Father? Look at me now!  High Archmage of Flobovia,
Lord Mage of the Conclave of Lords!~</em> (He carefully did not allow
himself to think 'former High Archmage, former Lord
Mage'.)

<p>
<em>~Trusted with a task of critical importance by My Lord himself, a
task that could win us the entire war!</em> He smiled proudly through
the cold and his chattering teeth.  <em>~And what a Lord he is!  That
'orbital strike' tactic of his was brilliant.  Clearly, he had no
stomach for it...I thought the lad was going to puke on his shoes
after it went off, although he held it together well enough.  I doubt
that great oaf Frederick~</em> (he snorted mentally in
contempt) <em>~noticed anything.  But we fixed Our Lord's weakness,
didn't we?  I convinced Reynard and Matthew of what needed to be
done&mdash;I did, Father! Me!  It was my idea!&mdash;and we slipped
into his room and gave him the tools he'll need.  We forged him like a
sword, took out all the impurities and left him as the ideal leader
that Flobovia needs in this, her darkest hour.  Am I good enough for
you now, old man?~</em>
</p>

<p>
His thoughts were interrupted&mdash;finally!&mdash;by the arrival of a
tiny, ghostly bird.  It flew up, hovered in front of him and spoke in
Thomas's voice.
</p>

<p>
"Now." 
</p>

<p>
Isaac surged to his feet, momentarily forgetting the cold in his
excitement.  This was it!  His moment of triumph!  The moment when he
became a hero, when everyone finally recognized that his intelligence
was just as important&mdash;more important!&mdash;than the bulging
muscles and handsome faces of the other boys from his village.  The
moment when he proved that the son of a farmer could be just as
important, just as worthwhile, as the Count's son in his big house up
on the hill, with all his silks and horses and good looks that set the
girls swooning.
</p>

<p>
He could have cast the spell while squatting down, sheltered from the
wind, but no.  This moment should happen on his feet, standing tall!
He was changing history here, and he would do it proudly!
</p>

<p>
Gleefully, he set the bag on the ground, opening it to reveal the
soccer-ball-sized rock inside.  The arctic wind whipped his robes and
beard around him as he straightened up, glancing once more at the
paper even though the words were firmly engraved in his photographic
memory.
</p>

<p>
"Polymorph Any Object: rock to six grams of antimatter osmium!"
</p>

<center>o-o-o-o</center>

<p>
Fifty miles away, Albrecht and I were carefully facing such that Mount
Herabu was slightly behind us, out of the field of view. (I was,
pardon the pun, attached to my eyeballs.)  The moment after the
would-have-burned-your-vision-out-if-you-were-looking-at-it flash went
off, we turned to face its source...and watched the mushroom cloud
climb slowly into the sky, revealing the big empty hole where the top
of Mount Herabu&mdash;and, although we couldn't see it, former
Archmage Isaac Davidson&mdash;completely ceased to be.
</p>

<p>
"And lo, I am become Death, Destroyer of Worlds," I whispered softly,
and smiled as I marked off the first item on my todo list.
