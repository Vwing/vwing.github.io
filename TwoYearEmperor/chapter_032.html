<p>
"Jake, why don't we open this conversation up a bit?" Albrecht
proposed as we paced back to the tent.  "Perhaps Kadja and Thomas
could join us for the rest of the discussion.  I suspect they'll both
have valuable input."
</p>

<p>
I didn't really have a preference; Albrecht and I had already covered
the part where he was going to help me kill off all the Landguard and
the Archmagi.  That was the bit that I thought perhaps I shouldn't
share with Thomas; everything else we needed to cover could be
discussed in front of others.
</p>

<p>
"Sure, works for me.  In fact, I'd like to invite my executive
assistant in as well."  The timing worked well; we were just passing
the group of Landguard who were protecting Suze.  (Thomas
had...strongly...advocated not bringing her, due to the possible
battlefield conditions.  I overruled him; I needed my memory-maiden
with me.)  I gave her the nod and she fell in behind us.
</p>

<p>
We entered the tent and took our seats; Kadja, Suze, and Thomas pulled
up three of the extra chairs that had been provided for exactly such a
contingency.  Suze sat a little behind me on my left, visible in my
peripheral vision. Thomas and Kadja sat at the table, across from each
other.  For whatever reason, Albrecht and Thomas's little
wedding-tackle-measuring stunt outside had calmed tensions down a lot;
both Thomas and Kadja were actually willing to not have a blade
actively in their hand for entire seconds at a time.
</p>

<p>
Hey, you take your progress where you find it.
</p>

<p>
"Suze, Thomas, Kadja, to bring you up to speed: the goal of this
conference is to find a diplomatic solution to this war.  We've dealt
with some of the issues already; I think we were talking about how to
manage the troubles with the Archpriest and the Association of Magi,"
I offered.  "Any thoughts on that, any of you?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas looked surprised.  "I thought we already discussed this?  You
were going to apologize and offer him amends...including one that I
wasn't terribly fond of."
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.  "Not that problem.  The problem where he loathes and
despises everything about the Deorsi and therefore attempting to reach
an accomodation with them will lead to a proxy war with the country's
primary religion."
</p>

<p>
Thomas sat back and folded his arms.  "Ah," he replied thoughtfully.
"Yes, <em>that</em> problem."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht shifted slightly in his seat.  "My understanding of your laws
is that any religion is free to build temples and conduct worship so
long as they do not criticize or preach against another religion and
do not practice sentient sacrifice.  Am I mistaken?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas shrugged.  "Technically, yes.  But the Archpriest tends to vote
in Conclave against anything that will benefit the minor churches, and
in favor of anything that will...well, maybe 'harm' is the wrong word,
but at least lessen their influence."
</p>

<p>
"He does harm the minor churches directly," Suze murmured.  We all
turned to her and she almost shriveled back into her seat.  When I
gave her an encouraging nod she gathered herself up, took a deep
breath, and continued.  "Just last week, he sent one of his Prelates
to sell land cheap to a tanner who wanted to open a new shop. But the
land is next to the temple of Chusiri out on Wayfarer's Field."
</p>

<p>
We all winced, thinking what the stench of a tannery would do to the
attendance at that church.  When I managed to shake the image out of
my mind I looked curiously at Suze.  "That's really important, Suze.
Thank you.  How did you hear about it?"
</p>

<p>
She gave a smile that was equal parts shyness, pride, and
bitterness...with just a soup&ccedil;on of vindictiveness for accent.
"No one notices the servants, M'Lord.  Darry told me.  He's one of the
footmen who attend His Benevolence's carriage, and His Benevolence
gave the orders about the tanner as he was getting in.  Darry was
standing not two feet away, holding the carriage door.  His
Benevolence didn't mention the temple, but Anne, one of the scullery
maids, she has an uncle who lives on the edge of Wayfarer's Field, and
so she recognized the description of where the land was."
</p>

<p>
We all sat back and considered that one.  "I have to say, I'm
impressed.  Totally legal and, if he's asked, the Archpriest just says
that he wanted to help out a struggling entrepreneur.  He can probably
even make it stick, if he's set up standing contracts between the
tanner and the church."
</p>

<p>
"The True Church, M'Lord," Thomas corrected me.  I raised an eyebrow
at that but decided not to push it in front of Albrecht.
</p>

<p>
"I would suggest that we table this issue for now," Thomas said
firmly.  "The Deorsi can legally set up their church, so long as they
don't interfere with the True Church or any of the minor churches.
Whatever His Benevolence may or may not do is a problem for another
time."
</p>

<p>
That seemed a little abrupt, but it made good sense.  I leaned
forward, resting my folded arms on the table.  "Fair enough.  So,
next issue, what about the Association of Magi?  If this war starts up
between the Association and the Justiciars, we've got a problem."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht smiled lazily.  "I'm not seeing the problem.  If you have a
civil war, it's much easier for the Union."
</p>

<p>
I cocked a disapproving eye at him.  "Yes, it is.  Which means that,
if I need to turn my full attention to said civil war, I would need to
clear the decks of any distractions.  Like, just to choose a random
example, any invading armies and their home country.  And the easiest
way to do that is the same way that I just used to vanish the top
third of a large mountain.  Which could be seen to
be...<em>unfortunate</em>...for the army in question."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht chuckled.  "That would be most unfortunate, yes.  Although,
the collateral damage of wiping out a theoretical enemy army might be
fairly high if said army were intermingled with the population of
every major Flobovian city.  In fact, I think we may have discussed
this."
</p>

<p>
I sighed and rolled my eyes.  "Yes, yes.  We're both very big and bad
and can each really hurt the other.  Film at eleven.  Moving
on&mdash;the point of this conversation is to find ways to make
everything stable enough that you and I can both get what we want.  If
the country is in the middle of a civil war, I won't have the
authority to make treaties with you.  You could fight, and you'd
probably win, but I could make sure the cost was higher than you'd
like.  So, how's about we stop wallowing in the schadenfreude and find
a solution?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht's lips moved as he sounded out 'wallowing in the
schadenfreude', a puzzled look on his face.
</p>

<p>
I sighed in frustration.  "It means 'pleasure taken in the misery of
someone else'.  It's German," I snapped out
impatiently.  <em>~Reminder #3: Translation magic still not handling
idioms or non-English words.  Stop forgetting this.~</em>
</p>

<p>
His eyebrows went up in gratified epiphany and he nodded.  "As I
understand it, the crux of your issue is that the Justiciars want to
try the magi, but the Association refuses to allow it, for fear of the
penalty that's being requested.  Is that right?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas and I nodded.  He had his usual 'stoic and professional' face
on, but I for one was a bit uncomfortable with where this might be
going.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht smiled and made a throwing away gesture as though it were a
trivial issue, easily disposed of.  "Well then, it's simple.  The
Justiciars want to ensure that the magi can't harm anyone else.  So,
allow them to bargain a confession of guilt for a lesser sentence.
Announce that their talents are better served being put to use and
that they are going to be exiled instead of merely getting a one-time
level penalty from which they would eventually recover.  Require them
to serve in the Anundj&aring;n army, on the northern front.  It's
cold, poorly supplied, and facing one of the heaviest concentrations
of the drauga, as well as at least twenty known lich generals."
</p>

<p>
I frowned.  "Why would they go for that?  They've hired a Speaker that
they think is going to get them all off the hook and, even if he
doesn't, it looks like the Association will physically defend them.
What's their incentive to agree?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht's smile had grown teeth.  "Simple.  Which do you think they
would prefer: to lose the trial and be stripped of their levels?  To
lose the trial and cause a civil war that will spill over onto their
loved ones, or else force the Landguard to kill them?  To win the
trial, but have Lady Justice following them for the rest of their
lives, hunting for an excuse to arrest them?  Or," he paused, and the
smile got sly, "would they prefer to be sent to a military post where
they will be treated as precious assets by their fellow soldiers, and
will see so much combat that they'll shoot up the levels like a
meteor?  With, of course, enough protection from the rest of the army
that they probably won't die?"
</p>

<p>
We all gave a slight 'oof' as Albrecht dropped that one on us.  I took
my time thinking through it; I built a thoughtweb with a main strand
of 'how could this fail?' and threads branching outwards on every
probability line I could see.  All of the ones related to the magi
themselves seemed easily resolved; I ascribed an 85% prior to the
propositon 'This will get you lots of levels fast' causing the desired
actions.
</p>

<p>
"The problem," I said slowly, checking the logic as I went, "will
actually be with the external perception.  If the Justiciars and the
general population don't see this as enough of a punishment, we'll
have the same problem as if we did nothing."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht shrugged and waggled his fingers distastefully.  "Details.
So you put a Geas on them to force them to serve for a year and a day.
And you fine them, make them pay significant reparations to the
families of the people who were harmed.  And require them to sponsor
one child from each of those families to the Association so that they
can become magi and defend their families in the future.  Get
creative, I'm sure you can find something everyone will accept."
</p>

<p>
Thomas and I looked at each other and both pulled the face that means
'hey, yeah, that works.'  I looked over at Suze.  "Suze, you're the
closest to the background of the people who were harmed.  If you were
the daughter of someone hurt in one of those mage duels, would this
seem like a fair punishment to you?"
</p>

<p>
She thought for a moment and then nodded slowly.  "Yes, M'Lord.  I
would be satisfied with that.  Especially if the magi were made to
apologize, and pay the reparations in person."
</p>

<p>
I smiled and slapped my hands on the table in excitement.  "Great,
we've got us a plan.  Ok, Albrecht, now that the decks are clear let's
figure out how we work the deal between our countries.  What exactly
are the priorities for you?  Leave aside the diplomatic trappings,
what are the specific results that you're trying to achieve?"
</p>

<p>
He pursed his lips and looked thoughtful.  "Well," he said slowly.
"We need more troops, especially magi and clerics.  Also, Flobovia has
yet to have a major infestation, so it would be a good place to cycle
troops for R&R.  We'll want to tap the brains of the Flobovian magi
for magical R&D&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I held up a hand to interrupt. "In my world, I wouldn't feel the need
to ask this, but this place is so screwy that I do.  When you say 'tap
the brains of'...that's a metaphor, right?  There's not going to be
any hot tentacle-on-ear action going on?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht looked startled, then chuckled.  "No, there are neither
tentacles nor ears involved.  Well, aside from the use that ears are
normally put to in conversation."
</p>

<p>
I let out an exaggerated sigh of relief and wiped imaginary sweat off
my brow.  "Good.  Please, continue."
</p>

<p>
He smiled for a moment and resumed.  "So, magi, clerics, and warriors
for defense. Unrestricted travel between the nations so that we can
rotate soldiers off the front lines and give dependents, children, and
noncombatants a safe refuge.  Hm.  We'll need to send out significant
scouting expeditions in all directions from Flobovia&mdash;if there
isn't one now, there <em>will</em> be an infestation here at some
point, and we'll need to catch it early if we're to have any chance.
Flobovia will be expected to provide soldiers and materiel to support
those expeditions.  And we'll expect you to mobilize your population
in the same way that we have&mdash;at least thirty percent under arms
by year's end.  We'll draw up a set of milestones for what level of
mobilization is required along the way."
</p>

<p>
I nodded.  "Of course, that just makes sense.  What else?"
</p>

<p>
"We'll expect to be able to set up temples of the High Church without
being molested.  And the temples will offer resurrection and
rejuvenation to anyone who asks.  Again, there is to be no
interference because of that."
</p>

<p>
I shrugged and nodded at the same time.  "I can't promise it won't
happen at all.  I can promise that rejuvenation and resurrection will
be considered religious practices and will receive the direct
protection of the throne.  Ok, so far we've got: troops, settlements,
R&D help, churches with undisturbed practice, help with scouting
expeditions, and full mobilization.  What else?"  I gave him an
intense stare, trying to beam the thought <em>Killing the Landguard
off, remember?</em> directly from my brain to his.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, there is something else," he declared, shifting so he was facing
me squarely and looking truly intense for the first time.  "And this
part is non-negotiable.  You yourself shall come to Anundj&aring; as a
strategic advisor.  And I mean immediately&mdash;this week."  He held
up a hand, cutting off Thomas's half-voiced protest.  "Don't worry, we
don't expect him to be anywhere near the front line.  But,
Jake&mdash;you <em>will</em> come, and you <em>will</em> devote your
full efforts to eliminating the drauga.  Anundj&aring; will guarantee
your safety; you'll have Thomas and Alpha Squad as your in-close
protection, and I'll provide a bodyguard of my most elite troops to
serve as outriders and ensure you aren't harmed."
</p>

<p>
Thomas jumped in.  "Absolutely not.  My Lord is not going into a
warzone with only a handful of Landguard to protect him.  It would
require the entire 'Guard to make this safe so no, I will not sanction
it."  He crossed his arms on his chest firmly and put on his second
best 'resolve face.' (So far as I could tell, resolve face #1 was
used only when he was actually holding a weapon and about to commit
large amounts of violence.)
</p>

<p>
Albrecht looked surprised, and chagrined.  "Oh.  Yes, I suppose that's
a reasonable objection...well, alright.  If that's what it will take
then yes, you may bring the entire Landguard.  I'm sure we can provide
barracks for all of you, with a bit of work.  It'll be some trouble to
provide housing and support for such a large body of troops so
suddenly but, if that's what's required to allay your concerns, we'll
make it happen somehow."
</p>

<p>
Thomas looked startled at that, but didn't have a graceful way out now
that he'd been given everything he'd claimed to want.  Ah,
precommitment pressure.  Such a convenient way to manipulate people
into doing something they know perfectly well that they shouldn't do.
He nodded grudgingly.
</p>

<p>
"Excellent," Albrecht affirmed.  "So, I'll expect to bring you to
Anundj&aring; by the end of the week.  Of course, you will be required
to provide details of your cannon, as well as your meteor strike and
mountain-destroying tactics.  In sufficient detail that we can
implement them ourselves."
</p>

<p>
I balked at that.  "Ah, no.  That doesn't work," I told him firmly.
"Not until we've worked together enough that I'm sure you won't use
them on Flobovia.  The cannon I'll give you, but not the bombing
tactics.  At least&mdash;I won't give you the details, but I will
implement them for you.  You tell me what you want destroyed and I'll
make it go away with extreme prejudice.  I'll need access to Flobovian
magi, of course."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht thought about that carefully for a minute and then nodded.
"That will be acceptable.  Now, what we're talking about at this point
is an alliance, not a straight surrender.  I can probably make that
work, but it's going to require a lot of political maneuvering.  It
would be easier if...."
</p>

<p>
I settled in for a long haggling session.  Considering that after this
meeting I needed to have dinner with the Conclave and apologize to the
Archpriest, haggling sounded like a blast.
