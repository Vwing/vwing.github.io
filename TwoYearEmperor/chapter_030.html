<p>
<em>Also, kudos to Sengachi for being the only reviewer to predict
what was going to happen to Jake.</em>
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Once he finally managed to stop laughing, Albrecht wiped his eyes and
came back to the conversation.
</p>

<p>
"So that deals with your priorities and two of your problems.  What
about the other problems: the various civil wars you've got
developing, and the Archpriest?"
</p>

<p>
I stumbled on that one.  "To be honest, I haven't gotten that far yet.
I was too focused on dealing with you.  I worked all this out before I
got here, but I didn't have time to get to the rest of it."
</p>

<p>
He smiled at me in a way that made me expect his next words to be 'Ah,
grasshopper.  Always, a wise man watches the flow of the river ahead,
lest its power grind him into a gritty little meat paste.'  Or
something like that.  I've never really gotten a good handle on that
'wise old master' stuff even though I had probably seen every ninja
movie ever made&mdash;or, at least, I thought it was likely.  Couldn't
be sure, of course, until I undid this mind whammy, but it seemed like
the sort of thing OriginalMe would go for.
</p>

<p>
"Well," I started.  And then I stopped, because I had no clue how to
finish the sentence.  Instead of floundering around, I closed my eyes
and turned inwards, starting to build a thoughtweb to analyze the
issue.
</p>

<p>
And immediately discovered that my mind was <em>sluggish.</em>
</p>

<p>
"What the hell?" I gasped, my eyes flying open in panic.  "What's
going on, why can't I think?!  What's happening?
I'm...I'm <em>stupid!</em>" I wanted to scream, or run, or flail, but
I couldn't move, frozen in place as though I'd been doused with liquid
nitrogen.  <em>Brain damaged.  Drooling, mewling idiot forever.
Cooked like a pot roast, just smart enough to realize you aren't very
smart any more.  The smooth, gliding flow of thought replaced by
plodding through heavy mud that sucks you down, makes it a struggle to
remember, to consider, to <strong>think&mdash;</strong></em>
</p>

<p>
Albrecht raised a calming hand.  "Relax, it's not permanent.  We're
inside an anti-magic zone, that's all.  It's suppressing our
intelligence boosting items, but they'll come back as soon as we leave
the zone.  I assumed you knew&mdash;I certainly felt it when your
bodyguard put it up."
</p>

<p>
I was shaking, wired up by the enormous dose of adrenaline that my
body had oh-so-helpfully dumped into my bloodstream so that I could
better fight off or flee from the evil lion that it assumed was trying
to eat me, except this wasn't the ancestral environment and there was
no lion, there was only the panic and the mud and it wouldn't <em>go
away</em>, why wouldn't it go away, I needed to think, oh god please
no, not this I couldn't go back to this please please please let
Albrecht be right let this not be permanent please please please....
</p>

<p>
My panic must have shown on my face because he rose, came around the
table, and pulled me to my feet.  "Come on," he ordered kindly.
"Let's step outside so Thomas and the others will feel safer about
letting you outside the zone.  Don't worry, it really will come back.
And your reaction is perfectly normal...everyone feels this way the
first few times they lose access to their enhancements.  We actually
have mandatory training classes on how to deal with it."
</p>

<p>
I swayed, unable to balance on my feet, and Albrecht steadied me with
a hand on my bicep.  As soon as I had my balance I turned to the door,
ready to sprint outside in my desperate need to be myself again, the
self that saw connections and analyzed problems with elegant grace and
I needed that now, right now, no more waiting, need to get outside,
need to gogogogogogogo....
</p>

<p>
Albrecht tugged my arm, spinning me in toward him and aborting my
frenzied race for the door.  "Calmly, Jake," he reproved me.  "You may
have lost some of your enhancement, but you're still intelligent.  I
know you feel as though you've just become the village idiot, but you
haven't.  You're just back to what you are naturally&mdash;possibly
more than that if some of your enhancement was inherent instead of
item-based.  Now, use that natural brainpower and calm yourself."
</p>

<p>
I latched on to what he was saying, and sucked in several deep, slow
breaths.  When I had beaten the panic back a few paces I forced myself
to run the times tables in my head, answer trivia questions mentally,
relive several short memories.
</p>

<p>
The answer was reassuring: no, I wasn't brain damaged.  In fact, the
bonuses I had gotten from the Wishes were still there, as Albrecht had
suggested they might be.  I was substantially smarter than I had been
when I arrived in Flobovia, I just wasn't as smart as I'd gotten used
to being.  The difference was like going from watching a movie on an
IMAX screen to watching it on a 10" black and white TV...but it was a
lot better than seeing no movie at all.  (Hm.  That analogy started
off so well and then it got away from me there at the end. Perhaps the
Wish-boosted state would be a regular movie screen and my unboosted
state should be the TV?  Except that was a pretty damning image to
represent my original self who surely hadn't been <em>that</em>
dumb...maybe a 60" flat screen?)
</p>

<p>
I forcibly wrestled my train of thought off the useless siding that it
had gotten stuck on and back to the main line.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht was watching me, nodding approvingly as I worked through all
that.  "Good.  Now, we are going to walk outside, <em>calmly</em>, and
you are going to tell Thomas to take the suppression field down.  Tell
him that it's so I can send a message to my camp for some documents
that we need.  Don't let on that you are bothered by the suppression
or you give the Landguard a weapon they can use against you."
</p>

<p>
I nodded dumbly, like a puppet with an unskilled hand on the strings,
and turned for the door.  Albrecht let go of my arm and paced
alongside, carefully staying far enough away that the Landguard
wouldn't decide he was threatening me and turn him into sashimi.
</p>

<p>
Stepping out of the dim interior of the tent into the bright sun left
me shading my eyes and blinking frantically to clear the painful
spots. When I could see again, the first thing that I saw was Thomas
standing between me and Albrecht, glaring at the Anundj&aring;n
general. Albrecht had stepped away from me and was standing with his
hands in plain view, smiling non-threateningly.
</p>

<p>
"Relax, Thomas," I heard myself say.  "We just needed to get outside
the antimagic field so that Albrecht could get some things from his
base. Drop the field, would you?"
</p>

<p>
He looked at Albrecht suspiciously, his face set in a mulish
expression.  I didn't say another word, just stared at him expectantly
until he reluctantly turned to Aerith and nodded.  A moment later, the
now-familiar <em>bong!</em> rang out and my brain spilled open once
again into the glistening lightspeed crystal that it should be.  I
managed to stifle my sigh of relief, but I did sag a bit.  I saw
Thomas notice; his forehead wrinkled up in a thoughtful frown and I
groaned mentally.  So much for keeping the Landguard from picking up
on the easy weaponizability of their antimagic field.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, Albrecht came to my rescue, distracting Thomas before he
could ask any awkward questions.  "Won't be a moment, Jake, I just
need to tell my base that we need the forms."  Reaching behind
himself, he pulled a small metal hoop from a pouch sewn to the inside
of his tunic.  Had I seen it in a blacksmith's shop, I wouldn't have
looked twice&mdash;a metal hoop maybe eighteen inches across,
apparently made of cast iron and about as thick as my pinky.  Albrecht
lowered it over his head like a crown, letting it drop all the way to
his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
Now, I'm not an expert, but I'm pretty sure that when you put your
head through a fun-sized hula hoop, your head is really supposed to
come out the other side.
</p>

<p>
Ha ha ha.  Ha.  I'm such a funny guy, expecting simple things like
"logic" and "reason" and "Euclidean geometry" to be on the job.  But,
nope, apparently they were all off at the beach, getting hammered on
cheap tequila and ogling the girls.  (Or, maybe the guys, who knows?
I never had been quite certain about Geometry's orientation.)

<p>
Despite his current capital offense (ba-dum tish!) against logic,
Albrecht's voice was perfectly clear.  "Bruno, fetch me the Annexation
papers and the Alliance papers, would you? We need to cover some of
the options, so best to have both."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht lifted the hoop up and off; his head wrote itself back into
existence in the wake of the thing's passage.  When he was fully back
in sight he looked around; he seemed surprised to find me, and the
entire Landguard contingent, staring at him.
</p>

<p>
"What?" he demanded.  "You've never seen someone ring their adjutant
before?"
</p>

<p>
"...not so much, no," I admitted.  The Landguard got over their shock
and went back to their eyeball duel with Kadja's cohorts.  So far it
was anyone's fight, although in my opinion the Landguard were ahead on
points...all four original members of Alpha Squad were just so
friggin' <em>huge.</em>
</p>

<p>
Albrecht almost managed to suppress his instinctive eyeroll at our
backwardness, but his voice was perfectly polite as he explained.
"It's called a ring gate.  Dead handy.  They come in pairs, and the
two rings are mathematically the same point; anything that goes in one
gate comes out the other, and vice versa.  Great way to send a
message&mdash;you just stick your head through and tell the person
what you want.  And, of course, you can store things near one ring and
reach in to get them from the other.  Whenever I go to a state
function I like to keep one ring in my closet.  That way, if someone
accidentally spills wine on me, I can grab a fresh shirt right away."
</p>

<p>
I'm sure the sartorial applications of instantaneous wormhole transits
were thrilling, but it was the economic and military applications that
excited me.  Instantaneous messaging.  Instantaneous transport of
goods.  The ability to shoot spells or arrows through them. The
possibility of portal cuts.  Trivial railgun development by dropping
something through the vertically-aligned gates, then flipping one gate
to the side to fire.  And, speaking of guns, the hoop was eighteen
inches across and my cannon were only seven...yeah, there were some
possibilities here.
</p>

<p>
"What's the range?" I inquired, working hard to sound casual.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht shrugged. "I've never measured it exactly.  I think my camp
is about twenty miles away, though."
</p>

<p>
"Can you make them bigger?  You could use them for transport, drive
wagons of stuff through them, all kinds of things.  How many are
there?"
</p>

<p>
He shrugged again.  "I have no idea.  A lot, though.  We use them for
basic communications, message passing, small object transport...all
kinds of things.  And no, they're all this size.  Don't ask why there
aren't any bigger or smaller ones&mdash;I'm not a theoretician."
</p>

<p>
Just as I was opening my mouth to ask the next flurry of questions, a
disembodied hand pushed out through ring, clasping a stack of papers
tightly.  "Here you go, Sir.  Also, there's two copies of each in case
you need them."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht thanked the person on the other side of the ring as I turned
to my bodyguards.  "Thomas, leave the field down; Albrecht might need
to get more documents." I held up a hand before he could finish
opening his mouth to object.  "I know, I know.  But he's really not a
threat, are you Albrecht?"
</p>

<p>
The jolly little general smiled a great big friendly grin. "No, of
course not.  If I wanted you dead, I wouldn't have used
magic&mdash;the Landguard were watching for that.  No, I would have
just kicked you under the table with this," he said gesturing to his
right boot, which suddenly sprouted a three inch stiletto.  "The venom
is toxic enough that you'd have been dead before you hit the
table. And the Landguard would have died the same round."
</p>

<p>
The Landguard were suddenly looking very tense; between one blink and
the next they were in 'Back-to-Back-Badass' position around me, blades
out.
</p>

<p>
Keeping his eyes on Thomas, Albrecht waved off his bodyguard.  "Pull
back, Kadja.  It's time for us to establish our bona fides with Thomas
and the others."  
</p>

<p>
Kadja made a noise that I was pretty sure translated as <em>Hey boss,
I totally hate this idea and I am going to make your life a living
hell for forcing me to do it. Also, you're a jerk.  kthxbai!</em>
Regardless, she and her Squad of Superlethality stepped back, leaving
Albrecht unprotected and only a few steps away from a very
calm-lacking group of Landguard.
</p>

<p>
Totally unconcerned, Albrecht toed off his boots and paced slowly
forward, his hands in full sight and a relaxed smile on his face.
Thomas shifted his weight slightly forward and his knuckles whitened
slightly where he gripped his blades, but his expression never
changed.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht paced right up to us and carefully settled to the ground,
sitting Indian style literally under Thomas's swords.  The whole time,
he maintained calm eye contact with the most lethal man I knew and
kept on smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Commander, I swear on my honor and on my love for my nation that I
have no intention of harming you, your Lord, or anyone else so long as
we remain under flag of truce. Now, with your permission, allow me to
explain how I <em>would</em> have done it, had I so desired.  It is my
hope that, if I show you how easily I could have killed you all, you
will believe me when I tell you that I don't intend to kill you all.
I truly wish to negotiate in good faith and hopefully create an
alliance between our nations, if not a merger."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht <em>actually paused</em> until Thomas nodded permission.
Talk about ice cold.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht accepted the permission with a graceful nod of his own and
then&mdash;slowly and carefully so as not to cause alarm&mdash;he put
his hands behind himself and leaned casually back on them.
</p>

<p>
"First of all, let's set a baseline.  My name is Albrecht L&ouml;fgren
and I am a High Marshal of Anundj&aring;.  I am currently wearing
purple boots with lime green tassels," he said, waggling his bare feet
to and fro.  After this odd statement, he paused expectantly.
</p>

<p>
Thomas didn't so much as blink.
</p>

<p>
After a moment, Albrecht sighed in disappointment.  "What, nothing?  I
would have thought you'd be happy to know that I'm not using any
divination protection and you can detect when I tell the truth."  He
paused again, but eventually gave up on waiting for a reaction and
just shrugged.
</p>

<p>
"In any case.  As I already said, I would have taken Jake out with the
toe dagger.  After that, all I needed to do was call out the attack
order.  You and the other Landguard would have been targeted by a
large number of Mage's Disjunction spells, which would have brought
down your Anti-Magic Field.  As far as I know, Flobovia doesn't have
Mage's Disjunction; you've simply had no reason to create such a
thing.  To you, magic is a means of production, of creation, and
there's no reason to want to destroy it en masse.  To us, magic is a
means of survival.  We had to create this spell because some of the
drauga are spellcasters and they have entirely too much fondness for
AM Fields and Walls of Force as battlefield control, and those spells
can't be brought down with a simple Dispel Magic."  He sighed, looking
at a sad memory off in the distance.
</p>

<p>
Eventually he shook the memory off and continued.  "It's not perfect,
of course, but statistically there was a ninety six percent chance
that you would have your AM Field and all your other active spells
destroyed.  Most likely, all of your magic items would also have been
rendered mundane."  He shrugged apologetically.  Duncan was looming
like a thundercloud, but Thomas was still completely impassive.
</p>

<p>
"Your items wouldn't make any difference one way or the other.  The
moment your AM Field was destroyed, you would all have been cut down.
If you will observe the trees over there, I will provide a
demonstration.  Alvis, proceed."  For the last he raised his voice,
turning his head millimetrically to speak over his shoulder without
looking away from Thomas.
</p>

<p>
One of Albrecht's bodyguards pulled another ring gate out of his tunic
and said something into it that I didn't hear.  A moment later he
flipped the ring so that it faced the trees and swept it casually from
right to left.
</p>

<p>
Every single tree in the forest fell down as though sheared in half by
a laser.
</p>

<p>
From over a mile away.  With no sign of a laser.
</p>

<p>
Dead silence fell.  The Anundj&aring;s were smiling grimly, even
smirking.  The Landguard, the Archmagi, and I...we were just staring,
listening to our paradigms shifting without a clutch.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht smiled a little sadly.  "And now <em>I</em> am become Death,
Destroyer of Worlds," he whispered softly.  "You see...it cuts through
cities too."
