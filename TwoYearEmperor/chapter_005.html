<p>
<strong>Author's Note:</strong> Sadly, I am neither G. Gygax nor
D. Arneson.  Would that I were.  
</p>

<hr />

<p>
There were two Landguard flanking the door to the War Room; as we
strode up, one of them stepped up to us and reported quickly.  "Sir,
the Room is pretty full&mdash;all of the Archmagi are here, along with
Dukes Frederick, Oliver, and Callum.  We've also got four Counts,
multiple knights and warleaders, the Archpriest and four of his
Hierophants, and the Imperial Spymaster; everyone is arguing fit to
shake the walls.  There's seven of the 'Guard inside, plus the two of
us.  Orders, Sir?"
</p>

<p>
I paused, glancing at Duncan.  He arched an eyebrow at me and scowled
in clear implication of what would happen if I handled this wrong.  I
nodded, running through the scenarios of what was probably coming.
</p>

<p>
Finally I sighed and turned to face him fully.  "Sergeant," I asked,
"the Landguard must have signals, right?  'Danger', 'threat imminent',
that sort of thing?"
</p>

<p>
He nodded decisively.  "Sir, yes sir."
</p>

<p>
It felt indescribably weird&mdash;and humbling, and horribly
uncomfortable&mdash;to hear that answer from a man old enough to be my
father who was a better soldier than I could even dream of being.  But
I gave a flash of a half-smile when I heard the "sir" instead of
"M'Lord".  Clearly, in his mind, there was a distinction between his
war leader and his political ruler, even if they happened to be the
same middle-aged schlub.
</p>

<p>
"Well, here's where we find out if I can do this job," I sighed.
"When we walk in, stick close.  Let the other Landguard know that
a...let's call it a 'stressful situation' might be coming.  If it
does, I don't want anyone hurt, but I do want the rest of the room
contained <em>immediately</em> so that things don't go completely
sideways.  Got that?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir, yes sir!" he responded, showing a smile that was really more like
baring his teeth.
</p>

<p>
"Now, clerics here can regenerate broken bones, right?  Make them good
as new, no lasting damage?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir, yes sir!"  Even more teeth were showing now; a wolf would have
envied that set.
</p>

<p>
I nodded to myself, then took a deep breath.  And another.  I forced
my shoulders to relax, settled my face.  Once I was physically
relaxed, I reached for that calm detachment and wrapped it around
myself like armor.  Once it latched itself around my mind I was able
to focus down, closing out the other thoughts that were chasing around
my head.  I focused on my breathing, closed my eyes, and very
carefully, one by one, I disengaged the brakes.  Concern for others
got locked in a box.  Manners and courtesy were told to stand in the
corner and face the wall&mdash;they'd be called if they were useful.
Respect for the law (the little that I had, anyway) got sent to its
room.  Humility was put on a bus to Elsewhereville.  Integrity was
kept close, but told to shut its mouth about the fussy little details.
</p>

<p>
All the other restraints and restrictions that make up a personality
were set aside one by one.  I pulled steel into my backbone and turned
myself into someone else, someone who wasn't afraid of anything and
wouldn't stop until he achieved his goal.
</p>

<p>
It sounds like bullcrap, but it actually works.  It's not a trick;
anyone can do it.  Shoot, I did this every time I went for a job
interview.  It's just a choice you make to temporarily leave behind
the parts of yourself that restrain you, and focus solely on one goal
with everything that's left.  Afterwards, you won't always be
comfortable with the actions you take during that time, but it makes
you hella effective while you're doing it.
</p>

<p>
I knew exactly what was going to happen in there, and I ran
the scenarios in my head one more time, preparing my response for
each.  As long as I knew what was coming ahead of time, I would be
fine.
</p>

<p>
Finally ready, I called out Allison's name and walked into the lion's
den, waving the two door guards to follow.
</p>

<p>

Inside was a madhouse, half the people red-faced and bellowing at each
other and the rest (the various scribes and couriers, mainly)
practically cowering.  Since the room was half the size of a
basketball court and fairly full, that was a lot of bellowing.
</p>

<p>
The War Room of Flobovia is spartan; light and heat are provided by,
respectively, Continual Flame torches everywhere and a fireplace on
each wall.  Three of the fireplaces were already lit, and the fourth
blazed up as I walked in; Allison, loyal to her duty as ever.  Along
the walls were benches where various couriers, scribes, and
secretaries sat awaiting orders.
</p>

<p>
In the very center of the room the Important People stood around a
large table, with their immediate minions in clusters right behind
them.  Each group was shouting at the others; interestingly, many of
the groups were arguing among themselves as well.  The main divisions
seemed to be along professional lines, warriors vs magi vs clerics
with the one person who belonged to none of those groups&mdash;an
unremarkable woman in brown leathers&mdash;standing quietly to the
side.  The priests were the only ones not arguing among themselves,
with the four junior members flanking their superior in a tight wedge.
</p>

<p>
I paused to study the table for a moment.  Heavy, some sort of dark
wood (oak?) with landmarks painted on it, suggesting that it had been
the main tool for tracking military engagements before I showed up
with my Major Image idea.  Speaking of which, the Image was not
currently in effect although Davis (I had somehow managed to remember
the names of the three magi who were assigned to the duty) was
sitting in a chair beside the table.  He looked like a mouse at a
leopard convention; I expected him to dive under the table any minute.
</p>

<p>
I watched the chaos for a moment, then tipped my head to Duncan,
indicating the room.
</p>

<p>
"RULER OF FLOBOVIA, NOW ENTERING!"  Duncan's voice, accustomed to
cutting across the din of a Landguard training ground, actually echoed
off the walls.  I had to resist rubbing my ear to make the ringing
stop; it wouldn't have looked dignified.
</p>

<p>
The annoucement did a great job of quieting things down, though.  All
eyes were riveted on me as I walked up to the table, Duncan stalking
beside me and one step behind.  As I walked, I flicked my eyes around
the room until I located Thomas; he gave me a tiny nod.  Whether it
meant that he'd seen Duncan's signals and was ready or was just
general encouragement, I couldn't say.  I really hoped that it was the
former.
</p>

<p>
I stopped at the table, an arm's length from Duke Frederick.  Took a
breath and considered him.
</p>

<p>
My weird-ass brain, currently running with no brakes, felt only vague
interest and just the slightest hint of pity.  Really, what could he
do to me?  Yes, he could yell and pound his fists and be intimidating.
But, really...what could he do?  In this room, he had two other Dukes
and three Counts who would probably back him.  Only four of the six of
them were actually warriors; the other two were desk jockey merchant
types.  There were also about twenty minor warleaders, many of whom
were actual warriors&mdash;but none of the Dukes, Counts, or their
minions were armored or armed with more than a belt knife.  I, on the
other hand, had ten of the most lethal killers in Flobovia (which was
still an intensely stupid name) scattered around the room in full
armor and weapons.  Plus I was pretty sure that Archmage Reynard, and
probably Isaac and Matthew, would back me in a real fight.
</p>

<p>
I smiled cordially at the man in front of me.  "Duke Frederick, thank
you for joining us.  I'd like to start implementing my strategy
tonight or, at latest, tomorrow night.  Your input would be much
appreciated.  Your experience could go a long way towards making this
work."
</p>

<p>
He snorted through his mustache.  "<em>Your</em> strategy is it?  And
what foolishness is that, hmm?  Little towers of singers playing the
lute at a smith?  People standing in lines handing each other things?
In a war you need to <em>attack</em>, to find the enemy and crush them
into dust.  Anyone who thinks differently is a fool!  But, of course,
you wouldn't know about that, would you M'Lord?  After all, you've
never led men into battle before.  Step aside and let the grownups
handle the strategy, boy.  You can play your little games off to the
side while we get the work done."
</p>

<p>
I had thought through this exact conversation in the hall outside, and
that was exactly why I took the brakes off.  My normal self, so
focused on being likable and not hurting others' feelings, could never
have stood up to this man.  Other me would have tried and mostly
managed, but not well and not easily.  Right now, with all the
safeties offline?  Duke Frederick could paint himself blue and howl
like a coyote and I wouldn't have blinked.  I really didn't give a
damn about this man; honestly, I was kinda looking forward to what was
about to happen.
</p>

<p>
I hadn't known the exact words he would use, of course, but it had
been easy enough to figure out the basic theme and to choose how I
would respond.  The response I had chosen was nothing I would have
dreamed of in my own world...but this wasn't my world.  Thomas and
Duncan were correct&mdash;here, I needed to be decisive and dominant
more than I needed to be right.  It was exactly backwards from what I
was used to.
</p>

<p>
"Duke Frederick," I said, speaking calmly and slowly.  My voice had
gotten even softer and my smile was wider; people who knew me well
would have recognized that as a bad sign, but no one here knew me
well.  "I would appreciate it if you didn't call me a fool.  Let me
rephrase this for you: the situation is very bad, I would like your
support, but I am in charge and, quite simply, you don't get a vote.
Now, we don't have time to fight amongst ourselves; if you can accept
my leadership, let's get to it.  If not, step down from your position.
Your heir can run your estates and after the war you will be fully
reinstated with my thanks and a reward for your good judgement.  But
you need to choose right now, and you need to stick with your choice."
</p>

<p>
By the end of my speech, he was beet red and had stepped closer to
loom over me.  "You dare?!" he shouted at the top of his remarkably
effective lungs.  "Who the hell do you think you are to suggest I step
down?  I've ruled the Edolian Duchy since you were in short pants, you
snot-nosed pup!  Wipe the wet from your ears, boy!  Two days in this
world and you think that just because some poncy courtiers tell you
you're our great savior that you can actually take Edolia
from <em>me</em>?"
</p>

<p>
My eyes were dry and I felt the urge to blink, but I never broke eye
contact with the Duke.  "Sergeant, crush his hand."
</p>

<p>
Frederick was a trained warrior with excellent reflexes, but he was no
match for Duncan's inhuman speed.  Frederick started to spin into a
fighting crouch and draw on Duncan, but before he had finished turning
halfway, the grizzled veteran was on him.  Duncan's hand closed on the
Duke's right wrist like a vice and slammed it down on the table.  A
moment later the pommel of a dagger crashed into the back of the
Duke's hand like a thunderbolt, smashing the bones to fragments.
</p>

<p>
When I looked up, the Landguard had moved.  Three stood behind the
Archmagi, bare steel in their hands; not directly threatening, but
entirely clear about what would happen in the event of spellcasting.
Two more of the 'Guard stood on opposite sides of the clerics, blades
drawn and ready.  Three more encircled the Counts and minor military
types, while Thomas watched the entire room, weight on the balls of
his feet and three feet of naked blade in each hand.  Seeing them all
shift from place to place between two glances reminded me of the
Weeping Angels, far and away the most terrifying movie or TV monsters
I'd ever seen.
</p>

<p>
Frederick clutched his shattered hand and screamed in surprise and
pain, sagging almost to his knees before struggling back up, sobbing.
Awkwardly, he tried to fumble his knife out of its sheath with his
left hand.
</p>

<p>
I spoke very calmly.  "Duncan, let him sit down.  If he moves or makes
a sound before I say otherwise, kill him."  The Sergeant nodded with a
wolfish grin and slammed the Duke to the floor before flipping his
dagger around and resting it against the Duke's throat.  His other
fist latched onto the Duke's hair to hold him steady.  Duke Frederick
froze like a statue, glaring at me in rage.
</p>

<p>
I looked around the room, eyeing each of the major players in turn.
You could have heard a pin drop.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," I said calmly, facing the Counts and Dukes.  "I was torn
away from my family, my friends, and my life.  I was brought here
against my will to do a job I didn't want, at a time when you face an
overwhelming enemy.  An enemy that, if they win, will make it a
particular point to kill me personally.  I dislike a great deal of
what I've heard about your kindgom&mdash;just for starters, I find
debt peonage abhorrent, and feudalism is an unbelievably bad way to
run a country.  The key point here is that I owe you
all <em>nothing</em>."
</p>

<p>
I stopped and turned, sweeping my eyes slowly over everyone there.
"There is absolutely no reason for me to stay here.  The smart thing
for me to do is walk away and leave you all to burn.  But.  For
whatever reason, I am going to do my level best to save you.  But I am
done with bickering, with being treated like a child, and with my
orders being questioned.  From now on, anyone who gets in my way or
interferes with my plans will be immediately stripped of their rank
and half their lands and wealth will be taken for the throne. Do we
understand each other?"  There were murmurs of assent&mdash;most of
them grudging&mdash;and jerky nods from most, resentful ones from the
rest.
</p>

<p>
I turned to the Archmagi and waved the Landguard to step back.
"Gentlemen, I apologize for having the Landguard threaten you.  You're
all extremely powerful, and I'm sure you've all had dangerous lives
that would make anyone react quickly in surprise situations.  I didn't
want to take a chance on startling you into accidentally flash-frying
everyone in the room."  I chuckled slightly and spread my arms, my
body language inviting them to join in the joke.  It worked; even
Isaac unbent enough to smile a little.  Score one for client
presentations and performing as a standup comic; I knew how to work a
crowd when I wanted to.
</p>

<p>
Now it was time to get them from 'not grumpy' to 'enthusiastic'.
"Your discipline&mdash;the life of the mind, the power of knowledge, the
effort to understand the universe...these are the things I'm trained
in.  I'm not a mage, of course, but I admire the work you do, and I
hope you'll continue to do it in support of the nation; we can't win
this war without you."  The ego-stroking done, I paused for their
answer.  They all nodded; Isaac wore an only-slightly-sour smile,
Reynard had a twinkle in his eye, and Matthew&mdash;quiet Matthew,
imperturbable Matthew&mdash;was actually looking at me in pleased respect
and surprise.
</p>

<p>
Finally I turned to face the clerics, again waving the Landguard off
before giving the clerics a half-bow. "Gentlemen, I don't practice
your faith, but I do respect it."  Which was a flat lie, but I wasn't
going to start talking about my anti-theist beliefs in a world where
gods literally went around smiting people.  "Your good works in the
city are the salvation of thousands, and it speaks highly of you that
you would undertake such works without possibility of repayment.  I
was delighted at your education programs and I'd like to offer
national resources towards expanding them.  Your efforts will be
absolutely vital in this war; without it, the men's morale will fail,
wounds that could easily be healed will kill them, and disease will
sweep through the camps, killing hundreds if not thousands.  As to the
bared blades just now...as I said to the Archmagi, I do apologize for
the Landguard's actions&mdash;they were acting on my orders, and I had
them take position around you for the same reason that I had them
restrain the Archmagi; I really didn't want to startle you into Flame
Striking the lot of us into oblivion."  I paused to chuckle ruefully,
again with the open body language that invited them to join me.
"After all, I'm sure you all have a lovely afterlife waiting for you,
but I'm not sure about myself so let's not be in too much of a hurry
to get there, hmm?"  I deliberately grinned.
</p>

<p>
Apparently the church is more political than the Association of Magi,
because the Archpriest clearly saw right through my ego-boo and
face-saving efforts.  One eyebrow went up a tiny fraction, his lips
quirked in a minute smile, and he gave the tiniest little snort of
derision as if to say "Really?  Don't you think that was
a <em>little</em> over the top?  Try it again without the cheese."
But, then his face relaxed into a true smile and he positively beamed
at me.  "The True Church would be glad to help, My Lord, in whatever
way we can.  And we will speak to the minor churches for you."
</p>

<p>
I nodded my thanks and turned to the last remaining group, the
warleaders.  Most of them were clearly furious at how I had treated
the Duke, but none of them were actively causing trouble.
</p>

<p>
This time a bow of respect; not too deep though, as I didn't want to
look servile.  "And finally, to the most critical of all.  If the
magi and the clerics are key to the war, how much more critical are
you?  Everything I have heard since coming here is about the courage
and skill of Flobovia's soldiers.  I've been told that, were we
outnumbered only two to one instead of five to one, Flobovia would be
fine."  Another flat lie, but whatever.  "Unfortunately, that's not
the hand we've been dealt."
</p>

<p>
I paused to let the compliment, and the grim words that followed it,
sink in.  I needed them thinking about the danger, not about my attack
on one of their own.  When I saw some of the anger easing, I
continued.
</p>

<p>
"Flobovia cannot possibly win this war without your support, and so I
ask you to stand behind your nation.  If we work together, it will
save the lands we all love, and the lives of the people who live and
work and pay taxes there.  With your help, we will smash this enemy
into dust.  With your help, we will crush them utterly.  With your
help, we can <em>kill</em> their men, <em>take</em> their gold, and
divide up their magic items as we see fit.  But all this&mdash;only
with your help."  I gave them a wink and nodded respectfully towards
the other groups.  "With, of course, significant shares in those magic
items going to the clerics and magi as well.  I think it only fair
that each mage receive copies of all spell books we find, and the
Church receive all healing items, don't you?  But the remainder shall
be divided among those soldiers that earn them by force of arms."  God
that was flowery and overly dramatic, but I thought it might fit this
culture.
</p>

<p>
Surprise and sudden thoughtful interest spread around the room.  I
stood silent, with the best impression I could manage of Sergeant
Duncan's evil smile.
</p>

<p>
After a few moments of avaricious thought, Reynard cleared his throat.
"So...you mentioned a strategy you wanted to execute tonight, M'Lord?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said.  Now it was easy to bare my teeth; I was proud of my
plan, and it was positively evil.  "All the magi with Dedicated
Wrights that you know of; I need them in this room, with their
Wrights.  Right now."
</p>

<p>
Multiple Sendings flew out from each of the three Archmagi.  Less than
five minutes later, there was a series of 'Bamf!' sounds, and three
men in robes stood in our midst, rubbing sleep from their eyes and
clutching pot-bellied clay figures that waved their stubby limbs like
fussy toddlers.
</p>

<p>
I was unpleasantly surprised that there were only three of them, but I
hid it.  Turning to a scribe, I mumbled a list at him, then took his
paper and handed it to the couriers.  "Get me three sets of this gear.
Fast."
</p>

<p>
Couriers sprinted off, and I turned back to the three new arrivals.
"Gentlemen," I said.  "I have a proposition for you...."
