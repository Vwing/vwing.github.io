</p>

<hr />

<p>
I led my posse (as I was starting to think of them) through the halls
towards the castle gate.  As we went, I rattled off orders.
</p>

<p>
"Suze, in my bedroom there's whole piles of sheet music.  Hire a
thousand bards, distribute the music to all of them, pay them each a
gold piece a day to sing it in the taverns for a week.  Shoot, make it
simple, just pay them ten gold each; it's not like money is a scarce
resource.  Hell, give 'em a hundred gold each and tell them to make
nine copies and hire nine other bards to do the same, even if some of
them have to go outside the city to find venues.  It's only money, and
it might get me some points with Loki."  She nodded, her hand
twitching slightly as though she were writing notes to herself.
</p>

<p>
"Let's see...Duncan, before we left for the parley I told you to stop
all cannon training and have them brought to the test range out by the
forest.  How are we coming on that?"
</p>

<p>
"Training is stopped," he growled.  "We were using that as the
training ground anyway, but some of the cannon were out on field
maneuvers.  They're on their way back."
</p>

<p>
I nodded.  "Good.  Send a message to the ones at the forest; move all
the generators back several hundred yards.  Set up one of the cannon
for test firing, unstep the barrel of one of the others and set it on
the ground nearby.  Stack all the other cannon into a wall about fifty
yards behind our test platform.  Oh, swab out the test cannon.  It
needs to be completely dry by the time we get there.  Finally, send
someone to fetch as many tailors as you can.  We need them on the
field, mas rapido.  With their gear&mdash;needles, scissors, measuring
tapes, whatever."
</p>

<p>
He shot me an irritated glance, presumably at the lack of explanation,
but he sent a few little ghost sparrows off.  Afterwards, the
irritated glance decided to stick around.  It even grew up to become a
steady glower and some quiet grumbling as he stumped along behind me.
I thought I heard the words "crazy drama queen and his surprises", but
I could have been wrong.  Maybe he said "racy prom, a dram of spleen in
these pure eyes."  Would have been a pretty nutty thing to say, but
then again, this was Duncan.
</p>

<p>
"Suze, have someone contact Albrecht and set up a time for us to meet
at his encampment tomorrow."  I exasperatedly cut Thomas off just as
he was opening his mouth to say something.  "Yes, yes, I know.  You
don't want me going into their encampment.  Relax.  Albrecht has no
motive whatsoever to want me hurt.  He's getting a peace treaty with
Flobovia and everything he wanted out of this whole war, without
having to risk another man or lift another finger.  If anything, he'll
be sending people to protect me."
</p>

<p>
Thomas looked disgusted.  "Yes, <em>obviously.</em>  I was going to
say, 'don't forget to bring a host gift'."
</p>

<p>
I actually stopped moving in my shock, then pivoted to face him.
"What?"
</p>

<p>
He gave me a look that said he was vaguely disappointed with my
manners, or lack thereof. (It was a very speaking look.)  "A host
gift," he said, speaking slowly and enunciating each syllable as
thought I were a particularly dim child.  "In this world, it's
traditional that you give a gift to your host when you are first
invited into their home.  It extends to diplomatic functions as well."
</p>

<p>
I nodded impatiently, waving his words aside.  "Yes, I <em>know</em>
what a host gift is.  What I want to know is why aren't you freaking
out about me going?"
</p>

<p>
He frowned in puzzlement.  "Why should I be 'freaking out'?  He's
getting a peace treaty and everything he wanted from this war, all on
a silver platter.  If anything, he'll be trying to protect you."
</p>

<p>
I just glared at him.  Finally, shaking my head and grumbling, I
turned and started walking again.  Thomas paced along beside me; I
wasn't sure, but I thought maybe the corner of his mouth was
twitching, just a little bit.
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later we were out at the edge of the Royal Forest, where
we had done the very first test fire of the new cannon.  Three tailors
had showed up, each with an armload of gear and a faceful of confusion
about what they were doing here.  I had asked them to please wait to
one side for a few minutes while I got things set up.
</p>

<p>
The Landguard were loosely clustered around me, all but Thomas faced
out to guard against possible attack from any foes that might happen
to be lurking.  Here, in the middle of a wide open field.  In the
shadow of the city walls.
</p>

<p>
Then again, I suppose the Vorpal Bunny of Doom might have its lair in
exactly such terrain, so what did I know?
</p>

<p>
"Everything ready?" I asked the cannoneers, waving a hand at the
weapon squatting behind them.
</p>

<p>
The squad leader of the cannoneers looked uncomfortable, twisting his
hat in his hands and looking anywhere but at me.  "Umm...yes, M'Lord.
It's swabbed out, just like you said, and we've moved the generator
back.  Um...."  He lost his courage and fell silent, twisting the hat
more fiercely.
</p>

<p>
"Problem?" I asked, forcing myself to keep a relaxed tone, even though
I was pretty sure I knew what he was going to say.  <em>~Crap, crap,
crap!~</em> I thought, frantically scrambling for a response.
</p>

<p>
"M'Lord, it's just that...the cannon have been having trouble lately.
Errrr...we've been doing something wrong with the cannon lately,
M'Lord.  I'm sure the cannon are fine.  But we haven't managed to get
a shot out since early this morning, and we don't know why and we're
doing our best...."  The poor man was practically gibbering by now,
terrified at having to report what he obviously thought was complete
failure at his assigned duty.
</p>

<p>
I waved him off with an easy smile, the necessary doubletalk popping
to mind.  "Don't worry about it...I'm sorry, what was your name?"
</p>

<p>
"Clarence, M'Lord.  Corporal Clarence of Cannoneer Company, First
Platoon."  The words seemed like they'd been yanked out of him against
his will, and he was starting to nearly writhe in agitation.
</p>

<p>
I gave him an easy, friendly smile and clapped him on the shoulder,
turning him to face the cannon and urging him along with me as I paced
over to it.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Corporal Clarence of Cannoneer Company, don't worry about a
thing.  This firing system is a complete lashup, I don't know why I
even suggested it in the first place.  Why, a little too much humidity
and the water will condense faster than it can be disassociated!  A
little too much static electricity in the air and the charge will
ground before it can do its work!  And that's not even getting into
materials defects.  So many ways this thing could fail, I'd say you
were brilliant to get any shots out of it at all."  It was completely
a case of 'can't dazzle 'em with brilliance, so baffle 'em with
bogosity', but I desperately needed to deflect attention from the
failure of the war machines I'd spent so much effort and resources on.
</p>

<p>
"Most likely it's this new high pressure front that rolled in from the
east earlier today," I rambled, nodding with certainty at my
completely untrue assertion.  "Yep," I continued, nodding sagely,
"change the air pressure and Boyle's Law says the hydrogen / oxygen
mix will deconvolve before it can deflagrate, and you know what that
does to the compression ratios.  Drops 'em right in the crapper, it
does."  I was tossing out jargon and flatly made-up words as fast as I
could in an effort to make everyone's brain say "this is boring...ooh,
look, shiny object!"  (Yes, when you are full of crap and trying to
hide something important, other people's laziness is your friend!)
</p>

<p>
"Seriously, I'm sorry for sticking you with such a tempermental
system," I reassured him.  "I'm putting a moratorium on the electrical
firing system.  Like you saw, it's tempermental and won't always work,
and we don't want to have it fail in the middle of a battle.  Also, if
there's a material flaw in the cannon then it could blow up and hurt
someone."  I paused at that thought, my forehead wrinkling as I caught
the absurdity of it.  "I mean, hurt someone we don't want to hurt.
Obviously the cannon is supposed to hurt people.  Just, you
know, <em>other people's</em> people, not our people."  I nodded.  I
was feeling more and more manic as I talked, the words starting to
tumble out faster and faster.  I took a deep breath, forced myself to
calm down, to slow my words down.
</p>

<p>
"Anyway, where was I?  Ah, right, the new firing system.  Step back,
if you would.  I need to focus, so don't distract me."  I flapped my
hands at Clarence and at the Landguard; Clarence scurried right off,
but the Landguard eyed me for a long moment before reluctantly backing
up a few feet.  Meh, it was enough.  I just needed some space to
concentrate.
</p>

<p>
I turned to face the woods so that everyone else was behind me, out of
my sightline and therefore less likely to distract me at a critical
moment.  Carefully, I ordered my thoughts, listing off key steps and
important elements, writing everything on an imaginary blackboard in
my head so that I could double- and triple-check to make sure I hadn't
missed anything.  Once I was confident that I had it all properly
arranged, I took the Ring of Three (now only Two, to the Archpriest's
benefit) Wishes out of my pocket and slipped it on my finger.
</p>

<p>
Eyes still closed, I began to recite from my mental blackboard.
</p>

<p>
"Flobovian magi are familiar with a third-level arcane spell called
Shrink Item.  When cast on an object of up to two cubic feet per
caster level, it reduces the size of the object by a factor of 16 in
each dimension, thereby reducing the object's total volume by a factor
of 4096.  The item may be shrunk as itself, or it may be shrunk and
also converted to a clothlike composition.  The object can be restored
to its proper size and composition either by throwing it on a hard
surface or speaking a command word.  This spell can be made permanent,
allowing the caster&mdash;and only the caster&mdash;to grow, shrink,
and change the composition of the object as many times as desired by
speaking a command word."
</p>

<p>
A deep breath; with the foundation set, it was time to start making
changes.
</p>

<p>
"I propose a new, fifth-level arcane spell which I am naming Improved
Shrink Item.  It is identical to the standard Shrink Item spell, with
the exceptions of the following changes: there are separate command
words for shrinking the item, expanding the item, changing its
composition to the clothlike variant, and changing its composition
back to normal.  All four of these command words must be specified
when the spell is initially placed on an object.  In addition, these
command words may be used by anyone or anything capable of speech, so
long as the speaker is within&mdash;" I stopped, dismayed.  I had
originally planned to say 'one hundred yards', which would allow us to
test from well back.  But that would mean that all future objects
enchanted by this spell would have that radius and that was a lot too
far; it made it too easy for an enemy to use the enchanted object
against the wearer.
</p>

<p>
I paused, licked my lips and made myself breathe, calming the flare of
panic that had shot through me when I realized I had almost missed a
problem.  Once I had my composure back I finished the sentence:
"&mdash;as long as the speaker is within ten feet."  I had an idea how
to get around that restricted radius, at least for the first couple
test shoots.
</p>

<p>
"I propose another new spell, which I am naming Improved Enlarge Item.
It is identical to Improved Shrink Item except that it causes the
object to grow instead of shrink."
</p>

<p>
I reviewed those words carefully, making sure I had properly captured
my intent.  Deciding that they were accurate and complete, I plunged
down the home stretch.
</p>

<p>
"I am imagining a magic item that I shall call a Rule of Size.  This
item is made of magically unbreakable adamantite but otherwise has the
same form as an inches-and-centimeter ruler from my world.  It is one
quarter inch thick and one inch wide.  Its default length is twelve
inches, but on command it will change to any length from one
millimeter to ten feet.  Regardless of its size, it shall always weigh
exactly pi over four ounces."  (Why pi over four?  Why not?  Consider
it my payback against this universe for all the ways it had screwed
with me so far.)  "In my visualization, there are two command words
engraved on the Rule, one on the front and one on the back.  The first
word is 'Reducio', the second word is 'Enlargio'.  When the Rule is
touched to an object and the word Reducio is spoken, the Rule will
cast an Improved Shrink Item spell on that object, using a caster
level of one thousand.  When the Rule is touched to an object and the
word Enlargio is spoken, the Rule will cast an Improved Enlarge Item
spell on that item, using a caster level of one thousand."  Because,
really, if you have to pick a number that will affect how cool your
magic item is, why not go crazy with it?  (Well, because Ilara might
decide to smush my head if I went <em>too</em> crazy, that's why.)
</p>

<p>
A quick review; yep, no holes that I could see.  "Finally, I am
imagining a second magic item, which I will call an Eternal Hourglass.
It is a block of adamantite in the shape of an hourglass, and of the
largest size that will fit comfortably in my hand.  Engraved on the
top of the hourglass is the word 'Permanencio.'  To activate the
Hourglass the holder must touch it to an object or a creature, speak
the word 'Permanencio', and name one spell or magic effect that is
currently affecting that object or creature.  When the Hourglass is
activated, it will cast a Permanency spell on the named spell or
magical effect.  This Permanency spell will have a caster level of one
thousand."  Yeah, good luck dispelling <em>that</em>, local mages!
When I said 'Permanent', I <em>meant</em> Permanent.
</p>

<p>
After one last pause-and-ponder moment, I popped the last two Wish
rubies out of the Ring, crushed the first one and said, "I Wish to
have, here in my hand, a Rule of Size."  There was a faint crackle, a
puff of cyan smoke whumped out of midair, and a remarkably light bar
of gray metal appeared on my left palm.  I tucked it into my pocket
and held out my hand again, crushing the second ruby.  "I Wish to
have, here in my hand, an Eternal Hourglass."  This time the smoke was
fuschia and the resulting object was a lot heavier&mdash;several
pounds at least.
</p>

<p>
I took a moment to mourn all of the other Wishes that I could have
made; I could have created magic items that created magic items.  I
could have given the Eternal Hourglass the ability to cast Time Stop
and Haste and so on as well as Permanency&mdash;unlimited Time Stop
spells would have solved <em>so</em> many of my problems.  I could
have created an item with the power 'When activated, Jake wins.  No
exceptions.'  Wish was <em>just that broken</em>&mdash;it said it
could "Create a magic item, or add to the powers of an existing magic
item."  That was all. No restrictions on what kind of powers, how many
powers, how often it could be used.  Just "a magic item."  Crap on a
cracker, could there <em>possibly</em> be a more broken ability than
that?  (Well, aside from "I wish for a Ring of Three Wishes", but I
had already established with p < 0.000000000000000001&mdash;hell, you
could add a whole lot more zeroes in there&mdash; that Wishing for
more Wishes was <em>A Really Bad Idea, For Realz, Yo!</em>  I had had
a feeling that pushing my item-creation Munchkinry too far might have
Ilara showing up for a repeat engagement of Jake-tossing...hence why
my actual Wishes were so tame (albeit, amazingly abusable).  Shoot, I
hadn't even given the Rule the ability to bespell creatures as well as
objects&mdash;and I had <em>really</em> wanted to.  The idea of
casting it on myself and then doing a real-life growth punch &agrave;
la The Atom from the comics was just too shiny for words.
Unfortunately, I felt like I was already skating on the edge of what
might get me divinely fricasseed, so I had decided not to push it.
</p>

<p>
My breath whooshed out as it finally sank in that yes, I had actually
managed to pull that off without crashing the universe's
natural-language processor or being decorpitated by an angry divinity.
</p>

<p>
I turned back around with a victorious grin, a fistpump, and a plosive
"Boom!  Done it!"
</p>

<p>
Everyone just stared at me, waiting for something more exciting than
me monologuing.
</p>

<p>
I sighed and rolled my eyes.  Yeesh.  You verbally program some
unknown sort of metaphysical Wish interpreter into creating brand new
spells and magic items without exploding in your face or having a
fatwa pronounced upon you by some nigh-omnipotent wanker with
(somewhat justified) delusions of godhood...and all they could do is
stare expectantly?  Really?  Where's the love?
</p>

<p>
Grumbling, I moseyed over to the cannonbarrel that was lying on the
ground, tapped it with the Rule, and said "Reducio.  My command words
shall be as follows: Rod-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Shrink,
Rod-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Grow, Rod-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Cloth,
Rod-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Normal.  These words are for the following
functions, respectively: shrinking, size-restoring, changing to cloth,
changing from cloth back to normal."
</p>

<p>
A blue-gold mist gathered around the Rule, silver and green sparks
dancing through it like manic pixies wired up on three double
espressos.  It hovered around the Rule for a moment, the sparks
bouncing back and forth to my hand, making my skin tingle and my hair
stand up.  After a few seconds, it slid down the length of the Rule,
spread out to wrap itself around the entire cannonbarrel, and sank
into the metal until it disappeared from sight.
</p>

<p>
The sight of it stitched a soft and dreamy smile onto my face.  No
matter how much I would have liked to be eating that croissant back in
my favorite bakery right now, I had to admit that magic was
Just. So. Freaking. <em>Cool!</em>
</p>

<p>
I tapped the cannonbarrel with the Hourglass and said "Permanencio on
the Improved Shrink Item spell."  For the briefest moment the area
around the cannonbarrel froze, everything in that region becoming
black-and-white and freezing in time.  I leaned in to study the fine
dusting of pollen on the abdomen of a passing bee but, before I could
get a good look, the effect ended and the bee continued on its
bee-merry way.
</p>

<p>
"Rod-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Shrink," I commanded.  Bam!  The heavy iron
cannonbarrel was gone.  Very carefully, I pushed the grass aside with
my hands and studied the ground in front of me until I managed to spot
the miniaturized weapon.  It was now a metal cocktail straw, less than
five inches long and less than half an inch in diameter.
Straightening up, I made sure I was out of the way and called out
"Rod-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Grow" to return it to its original size.
</p>

<p>
Now I turned to the others, smiling and gesturing to the newly
enchanted mass of metal.  "Pretty cool, huh?" I demanded.   
</p>

<p>
Thomas nodded, but his brow was still furrowed.  "This will easily
solve the transportation problem for the cannon, M'Lord.  What will
you do for the new firing system you were mentioning?"
</p>

<p>
I gawped at him.  Wasn't it obvious...?  No, obviously not.  I sighed.
"But wait, there's more!" I told him, waving one of the tailors
forward.  One quick cry of "Rod-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Cloth" changed the
cannonbarrel to a flannel-like material without changing its size.  A
low-voiced discussion with the tailor and two minutes later he had cut
the flannel cannonbarrel open, rolled it up and fastened it. I had a
tight roll of cloth, six feet long and three-and-one-half inches in
diameter, with rounded ends.  The whole thing was held closed by a
strip of its own material, carefully wound around it and tied off at
the top, the whole thing stitched in place with threads taken from one
edge of the fabric.
</p>

<p>
I picked the thick cloth rope up and looped it casually over my
shoulders as I sauntered off to the cannon that was waiting to be test
fired.  Carefully, I fed the cloth down into the cannon to verify that
it would fit down the barrel without catching.  When it did, I pulled
it out, carefully stretched it out straight on the ground, and told it
to "Rod-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Normal", turning it back into a bar of solid
iron.
</p>

<p>
"Clarence, put this rod in the barrel of the cannon," I told him.  He
looked at me in confusion, but hustled over and hoisted the rod
up&mdash;it took some effort, the thing weighed almost a hundred and
fifty pounds&mdash;and manhandled it into the barrel of the cannon,
where it stuck out about half a foot as it rested against the thick
backplate of the cannon.  We had totally nailed it on the diameter; it
just fit inside the barrel with only enough clearance to be lowered
easily into place.
</p>  

<p>
I really should have left it to the others, but I just couldn't
resist.  I dragged one of the bags of cannonshot over, along with some
wadding, and started getting them ready.
</p>

<p>
"Thomas, come here a sec.  See this beetle?"  Thomas bent over, noting
the inch-long green and purple creature as it trundled along through
the grass.  He looked at me, waiting patiently for the explanation.  I
smiled enigmatically.  "Study him.  Get familiar with him.  It's
important."  Thomas raised an eyebrow, then shrugged and set to
peering closely at the wee beastie.
</p>

<p>
I straightened up and moved to where I had set cannon
materials. "Now," I began, preparing the wadding as I spoke.  "With
the old style electrical firing system, you needed to put water down
the barrel, ensure that you had added enough but not too much, ensure
that the charging wire was inserted to the right depth, crank the
generator...lots of fuss and muss.  With the new system, you put the
rod in the barrel like so, you say 'Rod-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Shrink' like
so, push the wadding in like <em>so</em>, pour shot on top of it
like <em>so</em>..." I paused, grinned wickedly, and poured in five or
six times the normal charge of shot.  "And then you run and get in the
test bunker.  Come on," I trotted off toward the stacked-up cannon
barrels that would be protecting us.
</p>

<p>
I don't think the Landguard knew exactly what was going to happen, but
they were smart enough to have figured out the primary rule of weapons
testing: a weapons tester in rapid motion towards cover should be
considered sufficient reason to run for said cover without asking
stupid questions. Thomas abandoned his beetle, the tailors quickly
grabbed up their gear, and everyone hustled after me.
</p>

<p>
When we were all hunkered down in our improvised defensive position, I
first checked that everyone's head was below the top of the makeshift
barrier, and paused to pull one of the tailors down.  Once everyone
was safe, I turned to Thomas who was squatting behind me.  "Use your
gauntlet.  Send a message to that beetle.  Tell it
'Rod-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Grow'."
</p>

<p>
Thomas frowned.  "That doesn't work.  Command words can't be triggered
by spells."
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.  "Magic Mouth and some other spells explicitly say
that they can't use command words.  Other spells, including the
Sending that you have in your gauntlet, don't have that restriction.
Even if they did, though, I explicitly wrote the definition of
Improved Shrink Item so that 'anything capable of speech' could
activate the command words&mdash;and that includes a Sending spell.
And a Sending spell can be sent to 'any creature you are familiar
with'...which is why I told you to get familiar with that beetle.
Now, talk to that beetle!"
</p>

<p>
Thomas frowned again, then shrugged and sent the message.  He clearly
didn't expect it to work, but he followed orders.
</p>

<p>
The little ghost-sparrow flew over, hovered next to the cannon that
loomed over our insectoid message recipient, and spoke in Thomas's
voice: "Rod-Alpha-Alpha-Alpha-Grow."
</p>

<p>
There was a wham! sound and the test cannon rang like a bell.  A split
second later there was the sound of multiple logs being run through a
woodchipper at once; when we looked up, a massive swath of the forest
a hundred yards downrange from our test cannon was devastated.  Most
of the trees looked as though they'd been attacked by psychotic
beavers armed with icepicks; enormous chunks had been blasted out of
them, fist-sized pock marks covering everything that hadn't actually
been ripped off the trunk.  Almost every leaf had been stripped off,
and several medium-sized saplings had been broken in half, their
jagged stumps sticking up in the middle of the destruction.
</p>

<p>
We all straightened up slowly.  I was grinning maniacally and eyeing
the others, waiting for their acknowledgement.  The others were all
staring at the demolished stretch of forest.
</p>

<p>
Slowly, they pivoted back to face me.  After a long moment, Duncan
cleared his throat and spoke for the group.  "Well...maybe these toys
of yours aren't <em>completely</em> worthless."
</p>

<p>
I cackled and started explaining to Clarence&mdash;newly appointed as
the Master of Cannon Makers&mdash;what the callsign alphabet was, how
iterative naming could generate arbitrarily large numbers of unique
identifiers, and how totally awesome it was going to be to blow a
bunch of slimy undead back to hell by shouting out
'Rod-Zulu-Oscar-Tango-Grow'!  (Well, obviously we wouldn't actually
be calling out that <em>specific</em> name until we were able to field
467,136 cannon.  You get the idea, though.)
</p>

<p>
For the rest of the evening the tailors turned one half of the
cannonbarrels into firing rods for the other half, I enchanted the
firing rods (and the cannon, to make them easy to transport), and the
Landguard wadded and loaded cannon for test shots.  We left much the
wiser; the range of the new firing mechanism was long and it was a lot
more powerful than the steam cannon had been.  Also, since the cannon
itself and the firing rod could all be shrunk and turned to cloth,
transport was a snap; one soldier could carry the cannon and the
firing rod in his backpack.
</p>

<p>
That was the good news.  The bad news was that firing rods would
occasionally break from the shock of pushing heavy iron shot out of
the way while expanding at nigh-instantaneous speed.  When that
happened, the rod was destroyed, the magic was lost, and that cannon
was pretty much deadlined until it could be unloaded and thoroughly
cleaned out...assuming that the explosive shattering of the rod didn't
destroy the cannon itself, which it did once while we were testing.  A
postmortem on the broken firing rods showed that the roll of cloth had
not been put together completely evenly; a pinched up section of cloth
had been frozen into iron, putting a slight kink in the metal.  That
kink became a stress point which made the whole rod fail after four
test shoots.  Solution: be really careful when making the cloth rolls.
It was annoyingly painstaking, but doable.
</p>

<p>
In other problems, the accuracy was for crap; the firing rod didn't
hit dead center on the wadding and so tended to send its load skirling
off in multiple directions.  If all you needed was to "blow the crap
out of...that area, over there somewhere" then you were golden out to
almost a mile.  If you wanted to hit something the size of a person
you needed to be a lot closer&mdash;fifty or sixty yards at most.  I
wasn't too worried; the cannon were mostly intended for breaching
barriers and being used on massed groups. If we wanted precision we'd
call a mage or a sniper (or, I suppose, a ballista crew if there
happened to be one handy).
</p>

<p>
We spent several very successful hours on what I took to calling "high
velocity landscaping." (It made <em>me</em> laugh, even if none of the
others got the joke.)  Afterwards I grabbed some souvenirs and we
headed back to the castle.  I had some proclamations to write and some
