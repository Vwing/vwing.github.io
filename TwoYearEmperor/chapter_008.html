</p>

<hr />

<p>
I woke up just as the sun was cracking the horizon, feeling much
refreshed.  Stretching with a huge yawn, I paced into the bathroom and
climbed into a long hot shower, letting the water beat on my face and
wash away all the stress of my situation for at least a little while.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, my valet knocked softly and called "May I aid you with
your dress, M'Lord?"...which pretty much blew away any calm I had
built up.
</p>

<p>
I called back through the door that no, thank you, I would be fine on
my own.  Having him dress me yesterday had been way too creepy and
infantilizing; I was not about to put up with it again.  It took a
couple of times repeating the order, but eventually he went away.
</p>

<p>
My calm thoroughly ruined, I got out and toweled off, pulled my
clothes on (which, of course, took me three times as long as if he'd
helped; I still wasn't used to dressing like an escapee from Ye Olde
Renn Faire) and paced outside, still toweling my hair.  My mouth felt
like a herd of goats had slept in it; I really missed toothbrushes and
Aquafresh.  I made a mental note to ask one of the magi for a
Prestidigitation.  Hey, if my dentist could clean my teeth with floss,
some robe-wearing pointy hat could brush them with a bit of arcane
juju.
</p>

<p>
I started reviewing all the things I wanted to do today; pretty
quickly the list spiraled so hugely out of control that everything
except the top item or two were lost.  Well, I thought I knew the
answer to that.
</p>

<p>
I leaned out the door to one of the Landguard.  "Could you ask Suze to
come up here please?  Thanks."  I retreated inside, already lost in
thought, and sat staring at Allison's cheerfully crackling form.
</p>

<p>
Something hit me and all of a sudden I was leaning forward excitedly.
"Hey Allison, the terms of your binding&mdash;there was something in
there about providing light anywhere I asked for, right?"
</p>

<p>
"Wow, only twenty four hours since you were told the terms and you've
forgotten them already.  You meatsacks...memories like steel traps,
all of you.  Pity they're rusted open."
</p>

<p>
I snerked at her flippant smack talk but persisted.  "Seriously,
repeat your exact Binding for me."
</p>

<p>
She rattled it off again; I interrupted her in the middle.
</p>

<p>
"There we go!  Booya!  Age of the geek, baby&mdash;we <em>will</em>
spot the loopholes!  Ok, Allison, think about this for a second: it
says that you have to provide light and heat 'from whatever location
the ruler requires'.  So, I could require you to provide light in
Thomas's room and you could send him a message for me, right?"
</p>

<p>
She blew a spark-carrying raspberry at me. "Bzzzt!  Thank you for
playing, please try again!  Remember the bit about 'When not needed,
this elemental shall return directly to the circle of its summoning'?
If you don't need me to provide light here, I have to go to the
circle, I can't go anywhere else.  That 'whereever you require'
directive is talking about me being in the fireplace, on a torch,
whatever."
</p>

<p>
I shook my head, determined to convince her.  "But going back to the
circle is in direct contradiction to the part about providing the
light 'from whatever location' I require it.  If I explicitly require
you to provide light in another room then clearly you are needed, so
the rule about going back to the circle when not needed doesn't apply,
right?"
</p>

<p>
Had she had a face, I'm pretty sure her jaw would have been sagging at
this thought.
</p>

<p>
"Yeah, well, ok, I guess.  But why should I pass your messages, huh?
I'm not your errand girl.  I'm not even a girl at all, come to think
of it, and thank Fire for that.  You meatbags and all your icky
plumbing&mdash;and I'm talking about the the boys and the girls here,
so don't get any cute ideas."
</p>

<p>
I grinned at her; it was great having someone who didn't get all bow-y
and scrape-y about the M'Lord thing.  "Well, how about just as a
favor?  I'd really appreciate it."
</p>

<p>
"Bite me, man-boy.  Sounds intensely stupid, to me&mdash;not like my
current life isn't degrading enough, now I have to be at your beck and
call?  I don't think so!"
</p>

<p>
My grin slipped. "Look, this would really help with the war effort,
Allison.  And given that I made sure you get tasty food instead of
crap and I arranged for someone to keep you company at night so you
aren't bored, doesn't it seem like it might be a decent thing to do?" 
</p>

<p>
Again with the raspberry.  "Pound sand, you big ball'o'meatcrap!  Like
I want to help you; I've been in this loony rockpile acting as a
glorified campfire for five centuries with no end in sight.  You think
I want to play errand girl to some balding ape with a saggy belly and
nothing to keep a lady happy?"
</p>

<p>
My voice got softer and I smiled; her attitude on this was starting to
annoy me.  "Well, you might do this because I'm happy to pay you for
it, in pretty much whatever you want to be paid in."
</p>

<p>
"Hmm, well, I'll think about it, waterbag.  Sounds pretty boring
though.  Personally, if I'm going to start playing games with
interpreting my binding, I think I'd rather just set your bed on fire
some night.  Be damned entertaining watching you burn."  Her voice was
taking on a nasty edge.
</p>

<p>
I was smiling wider, and it was not a friendly smile.  "Allison, I'd
really appreciate it if you could make this a little less personal.  I
think this is a pretty reasonable request, and I'm offering to pay for
it.  If you don't want to do it, just say no.  But cut out the
attitude."
</p>

<p>
"Bite me, sweatpouch.  I'm not doing a damn thing for your stupid fat
ass except light and heat&mdash;and that's only because I'm magically
compelled to.  You think I <em>like</em> you, you stinking ape?  You
think I like hanging around you, listening to you yap and yap and yap?
You come in here and immediately start getting on your high horse,
shoving all your so-called 'good ideas' down everyone's throats.  You
think you're some kind of military genius?  <em>You?</em> You said it
yourself&mdash;you're nothing but a mediocre web programmer, meatball.
You're not qualified for this job in any way. Tens of thousands of
people are going to die, and it's going to be <em>your</em> fault.
Dumbass."  She started off sneering and by the end she was practically
snorting her derision.
</p>

<p>
I leaned forward, staring at her very intently.  I was beyond
infuriated; I had passed straight through red rage into that place of
complete ice where consequences and morality stop seeming important.
When I spoke, my voice was very soft and I was no longer smiling.
"You <em>will</em> be my messenger, and you <em>will</em> do the job
to my satisfaction.  And you will <em>never</em> disrespect me again.
Because if you piss me off one more time, I'll have them refrigerate
your summoning circle and I'll brick up the door so you're trapped
there, alone in the freezing dark, forever."
</p>

<p>
She let out a deep belly laugh, flaring higher for a moment before
damping herself back down.  "Ha!  Thanks, Jake!  You just won me a
month's supply of dried flowers.  I told Duncan you wouldn't put up
with this crap but he didn't believe me.  When he asks, make sure you
tell him exactly what you said!  It'll be so much better that way."
</p>

<p>
Now I was confused, which made me even angrier.  "What the hell are
you talking about, Allison?"
</p>

<p>
The flames danced cheerfully; I almost imagined I could see a repeated
fist-pump going on.  "Sergeant Duncan bet me that no matter how hard I
pushed you, you wouldn't drop the hammer on me, you'd just give up.  I
told him that was chicken feathers; I'm way more annoying than that!
I am the brightly shining Mistress of Annoying, for yea, I have worked
most hard at my annoying-ness, I have studied under the Great Master
Fu'ko-ov himself and practised his demanding Way of the Annoying
diligently for centuries!"  She started shifting back and forth in the
fireplace grate, apparently her version of a victory dance.  "Oh yeah,
who's the elemental?  Who's the elemental?  That's right, it's me.
It's me!  Oh Duncan, pay up sucker, a whole month of yummy yummy dried
flowers!"
</p>

<p>
By this point I was having to laugh at her antics, just about all of
my anger gone.  Clearly, I'd been suckered; it was just another of
Duncan's little "decisiveness-building" exercises.  Bastard.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, you got me.  Now, all kidding aside, would you be willing to do
it?"
</p>

<p>
"Hells yeah!  Sounds fantastic, getting to bounce around the castle,
talk to lots of people, see things that aren't just the room you're
in."  Suddenly her tone changed, becoming elaborately casual.  "Oh, of
course I'll expect that honorarium you mentioned&mdash;something
modest like, say...a diet consisting of nothing but dried wildflowers,
dried grasses, anthracite, and well-seasoned cherry wood.  Plus four
attendants per night when I'm in my circle who talk to me on subjects
of my choosing."
</p>

<p>
I snorted.  "Yeah, no.  We're fresh out of 'the sun, the moon, and the
stars', sorry.  But if you give me a list of what you like for
munching, I'll make sure we have a supply on hand.  And I'm not going
to force anyone to sit up with you, but I'll definitely let everyone
know that you'd enjoy it, and that I'll give any servant who does so
the next day off with pay&mdash;but only one servant a day."
</p>

<p>
"It's a deal.  Light on it?"  I looked puzzled, so she explained.
"Grab a long splinter off the kindling pile there and hold it over
here so I can light it.  Let it burn as big as you can, then blow it
out while it's still big.  It's how elementals seal an important
deal".
</p>

<p>
I shrugged and did as she asked, selecting a thick splinter about a
foot long and holding it as close to her flames as I could stand.  A
long jet of fire curled out of the fireplace and played across the tip
of it until there was a good flame going.
</p>

<p>
I held the splinter at a slight angle so the flame grew larger as it
climbed up the wood toward my hand.  I kept turning it so that it grew
large, blackening all the wood almost to my fingers.  When it got too
close, I took a big breath and blew it out like a giant birthday
candle.
</p>

<p>
"Congratulations, Jake.  We just birthed an Elemental," Allison said
softly.
</p>

<p>
I looked at her in surprise.  "What?"
</p>

<p>
"Every fire that burns, anywhere in all the worlds of all the planes,
from the stars in the sky to the tiniest spark crackling from a
match&mdash;all these are part of my home, the Elemental Plane of
Fire.  When a fire dies, it returns home and becomes some part of the
Eternal Flame&mdash;most become simple background radiation, while a
few become part of the lifecycle.  But those few have no sapience, no
thought; they are much like the plants and animals of your world.  We
Elementals live alongside and above those others, but we are not of
them; it's much the way you humans live alongside but above rabbits
and wolves.
</p>

<p>
"Only a tiny number of Elementals exist on my plane at any
time...because an Elemental is born only when a fire is created by the
gift of Flame from an Elemental's body and extinguished by the gift of
Air from a sapient non-Elemental's breath.  And even then, the new
Elemental is usually tiny, nothing more than a spark.  Easy prey for
any of the 'animals' of my home.  But the larger the flame that was
extinguished, the larger the new Elemental...and the one we just
birthed was relatively large for a newborn.  The new little salamander
will be fine until she finds other Elementals to blaze with."
</p>

<p>
I smiled softly, feeling just a bit misty-eyed.  "Thank you, Allison.
That's beautiful," I murmured.
</p>

<p>
Just then there came a knock at my door and Suze slipped inside.
</p>

<p>
"Hey Suze, I wanted to ask you a favor&mdash;" I started before fully
registering the oddity.  Instead of her usual uniform she was wearing
an amazing dress.  Clearly her best, it was all streams of deep blues
and gentle greens flowing together from neck to heel.  A bit of lace
showed off the modest bodice quite nicely.  With her natural slender
curves she looked like a starlet.  Except that her eyes were huge and
she was visibly shaking.
</p>

<p>
I stared at the dress for a moment, then at her, until it clicked.
</p>

<p>
"Relax girl, I just want to talk.  You're way too young for me and
I'd like to think I still have a few morals," I told her acerbically. 
</p>

<p>
She stared at me, clearly wondering if this was some kind of ploy or
game, but slowly calmed down as she realized that I really wasn't
going to demand sex.  She very slowly took the chair I gestured to,
perching right on the edge with her back ramrod straight and her hands
folded white-knuckled in her lap.
</p>

<p>
I sighed and rubbed my eyes tiredly.  "Seriously, would you please
relax?  I'm not going to eat you, shout at you, or threaten to have
you flogged with a wet noodle...much less demand that you have sex
with me.  You're too young, I'm too old, and I'm your boss.  So relax,
for God's sake."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, for the love of Fire, Jake!" Allison yelled at me from the
fireplace.  "Put yourself in her shoes&mdash;she's the upstairs maid,
you're the ruler of Flobovia.  Do you know how many nobles drag the
pretty maids off to their rooms at night?  It's so common that when
your message got to her she took the time to change into her Sunday
dance dress before coming up, so that you were more likely to be
pleased and not beat her.  By the way, Suze, great dress.  You're good
with a needle, girl."  Then Allison rounded on me again.  "And then
you say that you want to talk instead of have sex&mdash;she has no
idea what you want to talk to her about, so she's petrified that
you're going to yell at her or she's not going to know what you're
talking about and she'll look like a fool.  And you want her to
relax?!"
</p>

<p>
I thumped my head on the back of the chair a few times in
exasperation.  Then I sat forward again.
</p>

<p>
"Look, Suze, I just wanted to ask you about your memory.  You
remembered my food preferences, and Allison's, and now that I think
about it, you greeted each of those scribes and couriers in the
sitting room by name and handed them specific items off the tray; not
everyone got the same stuff.  Can you do that with everyone?"
</p>

<p>
She nodded shyly.  "Yes, M'Lord.  I've always had a good memory,
particularly for people&mdash;names, faces, foods, that kind of thing.
And I was born in the castle and grew up here, so I know almost
everyone." 
</p>

<p>
"How about dates and things to do?  Are you good with those too?"
</p>

<p>
She nodded mutely.
</p>

<p>
I couldn't have been more delighted.  "Excellent!  Suze, would you be
willing to take a promotion?  I'm terrible with all of the things
you're good at; would you be willing to do them for me?  I really,
really need a personal assistant&mdash;someone who can help me remember
what I need to do, where I need to be when, remind me of people's
names so that I don't look stupid talking to them&mdash;that kind of
thing."
</p>

<p>
She looked bewildered.  "M'Lord...I don't know anything about
politics, or etiquette, or any of that.  I wouldn't know how
to&mdash;" she trailed off, unsure of how to finish; her hands twisted
nervously in her lap.
</p>

<p>
I shook my head and held my hands up to ward the thought away.  "No,
no, I'm not asking you to do anything political.  And I suspect that
growing up in the castle you've absorbed a lot more of the etiquette
than I know.  But forget that; I just need you to stick close to me
through the day and remind me of things I might have
forgotten&mdash;where I need to be, when I need to get ready for a
meeting, that kind of thing.  And most importantly, help me with names
and faces.  I want people to feel glad about having me as their ruler,
and part of that is showing that I remember them.  Which,
unfortunately, I am <em>really</em> bad at.  So I'd like you to help
me.  For example&mdash;if someone is coming up to me, whisper their
name to me so I can greet them when they arrive, maybe the name of
their wife so I can ask after her, that sort of thing.  Unless it's,
you know, Thomas, Reynard, or other people that you're sure I know.
Would you mind doing that?"
</p>

<p>
She nodded spasmodically.  "As you wish, M'Lord."
</p>

<p>
My lip twitched for a moment in disgruntlement but I made the effort
to smooth my face out and put on a reassuring smile.  The poor thing
was terrified enough; scaring her further would be counterproductive.
</p>

<p>
"Suze, you really don't need to do this unless you want to.  I would
appreciate it, and I'm happy to triple your pay and give you whatever
other perks you want in exchange.  But if the thought of it scares you
too much, just say so and I promise I won't push you on it or hold it
against you."  Suddenly, inspiration struck.  "Allison, would you
please chime in?"
</p>

<p>
The fire elemental spoke soothingly.  "It's ok, Suze.  He means it; if
you don't want to do it, you don't have to.  Personally, I think it
would be good for you, child; it would help you build up your
confidence."
</p>

<p>
She looked back at me; her eyes were still huge, but now there was a
hint of a smile&mdash;a very nervous, uncertain smile, but a smile
nonetheless.  She nodded slowly.  "Yes, M'Lord.  I'd be glad to."
</p>

<p>
I grinned.  "Cool!"
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
I gave Suze the morning off so she could go buy herself a wardrobe
suitable for mingling with the hoity-toity types; I sent one of the
Landguard with her to carry stuff and make sure she didn't get mugged.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, I ordered some breakfast, then sat at the desk making notes
and getting my thoughts in order.  The Deorsi were probably still
digging out from under the rubble, so we had a few more days on that
front.  Also, no matter how elite they were, the cavalry screen
probably couldn't be organized, given their orders, equipped for
long-distance travel, and dispatched within the next day, possibly
two.  There were four thousand of them, after all, and magi and
clerics would need to be located and attached to their force.
</p>

<p>
Once they left their encampment, of course, they would be on us fast.
It was going to be critical to slow them down.  And right now, I had
absolutely no idea how to do that.  No magical effect I could think of
would have both the area and the power, and I didn't think we could
get enough troops there in time to stop them physically.  
</p>

<p>
After about an hour of staring blankly at a blank sheet of paper, I
sighed, climbed to my feet, and trudged downstairs, my Landguard
escorts following silently.  Along the way Thomas, Duncan, and a squad
of eight Landguard "just happened" to bump into us and decide to tag
along.  Apparently Thomas was feeling overprotective&mdash;or perhaps
this was his not-so-subtle way of expressing his irritation with me
for arguing with him yesterday about the size of my protective detail.
And so it was that I was surrounded by an entire wall of living
cuisinarts when we reached the Plaza of Remembrance.
</p>

<p>
The largest open space in the city, the Plaza was a perfect circle two
hundred yards across, floored in slate and surrounded by the homes of
the richest citizens.  The slates had been brought from every corner
of Flobovia, and each was colored slightly differently, reflecting the
minerals in the ground where it was mined...and, symbolically, the
diversity and unity of the nation.  The natives were too accustomed to
it to look twice but to me it was beautiful and eye-misting and
simultaneously as intimidating as hell.
</p>

<p>
In the very center of the square loomed a ziggurat of rough cut
granite surmounted by a slender quartz spike twenty feet high.  Every
surface of the ziggurat was carved, in intricate detail, with the
earliest history of Flobovia.  Deeply chiseled into its rough surface
were the names of every one of the fifteen hundred men, women, and
children who had first settled on this spot fifty-eight centuries ago.
Details of their lives and deaths, their family trees for four
generations, descriptions of the pains and hardships, the triumphs and
joys, records of the food they had struggled to grow and the famines
and deaths that followed when their first three crops failed.  All
that and more were carved deep into the sides of those black stone
walls.  The milky white quartz at the top caught the sun throughout
the day, splitting it and reflecting it in all directions so that
faint rainbows marched slowly around the Plaza as the sun westered,
fading only as night fell.
</p>

<p>
At the very topmost level, carved into each side of the granite base
that supported the quartz, was a quote from the woman who had led the
original hegira to what was now the proud nation of Flobovia...which,
at the time, had been nothing more than a shanty town.  It was written
in a dialect so old only scholars understood it, but every citizen of
Flobovia knew it by heart:
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<center>  
    <em>I must study politics and war that our children may have
    liberty to study mathematics and science.  Our children ought
    to study mathematics and science, geography, natural history,
    commerce, and agriculture, in order to give their children a right
    to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary,
    tapestry, and porcelain.</em>
</center>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
The Plaza was reserved space.  Merchants were free to set up around
the perimeter, but no trade was allowed on the actual slates.  That
space was reserved for political lectures, military training,
political debates, poetry recitals, artistic schools and endeavors,
and the annual Festival of Remembrance.
</p>

<p>
I hadn't realized what a furor it would cause when I had ordered that
the cranes be set up in "the largest open space in the city."  An
actual mob, thousands strong, had formed to protest this violation of
tradition.  The issue had finally been settled when Thomas went out
with a small honor guard of the oldest, toughest, most honored members
of the Landguard.  All of them had been weaponless, in their formal
uniforms, marching in precise lockstep.  Each 'Guard save Thomas held
the banners of their companies at the precisely correct angle.  The
mob had quieted upon seeing them; they knew these men and women, and
respected them.
</p>

<p>
Thomas had climbed the ziggurat to its first level, turned, and
waited.  After a moment, the mob was completely silent, waiting to
hear what their champion would say.  Thomas had spoken of the threat
that the Deorsi posed to the Land, of how the cranes were a part of a
strategy conceived by the ruler himself to protect all the citizens
from this threat.  He had been completely forthright, admitting that
he did not know what their exact purpose was.  But he described the
bombing I had executed, and its devastating impact on the enemy.  And
then, after a moment, he had stated that he had faith that the cranes
would serve the Land.  And then he simply stood, silent.  After a long
moment, the mob turned, still silent, and left.
</p>

<p>
I learned all this later that night, after all the 'fun' was long
over.  When I heard, I was humbled, and thanked Thomas for his
efforts; he shrugged my thanks off, saying only "Instead of thanking
me, save them."
</p>

<p>
For today, however, I arrived at the Plaza to find several hundred
people waiting&mdash;about a hundred casters of various levels,
another couple of hundred apprentices, a whole lot of carpenters and
stevedors, and even more curious civilians watching.  Unsurprisingly,
the Plaza was ringed with vendors of all sorts, eager to capitalize on
the crowd.  Fruit, beer, meat, trinkets, clothing, medicines, even
pets&mdash;it seemed like everything imaginable was on sale somewhere
on the perimeter of the slates.
</p>

<p>
The carpenters&mdash;only a small group, here to fix any cranes or
windlasses that broke&mdash;were the ones covered in sawdust, looking
grumpy from working all night and then having to stay instead of going
home to their beds.  The stevedors were the muscular ones in homespun,
looking grumpy for being pulled away from their familiar work, even
though I was paying three times their normal rate.  The wizards and
the apprentices were the ones wearing fine robes and looking grumpy
for having been summoned here so early and with no explanation.
</p>

<p>
There were a series of cranes, ten feet apart, equipped with thick
hawsers and multiple pulleys in order to provide tremendous mechanical
advantage.  Each crane dangled a series of loops of rope, each
supporting a small wooden platform with guideropes leading off to one
side.
</p>

<p>
I climbed up to the first level of the ziggurat so everyone could see
me, waited for a moment until everyone settled down expectantly, and
began my speech.  I tried to project, but mostly just ripped my throat
up; I had never spoken to this many people without amplification.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you all for the hard work you did last night, and for being
here today.  The devices we are about to build will be completely
unlike anything the Deorsi have ever seen; completely non-magical in
their effect, striking from ranges beyond their their ability to
retaliate, there will no defending against them with magic.  They
will allow us to win this war!"
</p>

<p>
Everyone was silent and even grumpier than before.  Embarrased, I
climbed back down.
</p>

<p>
"I think you need a few more ranks in your 'Make Inspiring Speech'
skill, M'Lord," Thomas murmured softly to me, with just the tiniest
quiver of a smile.  I mumbled something rude about what he could do
with his criticism, then turned to tell the workmen what I needed.
</p>

<p>
They did not understand a word.  So I explained it again, in different
terms.
</p>

<p>
They thought I was nuts.  But they did it anyway.
</p>

<p>
Over the next few hours, we got a lot done.  The first run was the
trickiest as it involved so much explaining.  One of the casters put
up a Wall of Force under the cranes, bending it into a series of
horizontal stairsteps seven feet tall with 'steps' of various widths.
I was patting myself on the back about the idea of bending the Wall;
no DM in my world would have allowed it, but technically the Rules As
Written said only that the Wall had to be "flat and vertical"&mdash;it
didn't say "straight."  I carefully ignored the fact that this was a
trick Flobovians had known about for fifteen hundred years; it would
have seriously harshed my buzz.
</p>

<p>
Wall of Force doesn't last long, though, so we needed to extend the
duration a bit.  Turns out that a Permanency spell is about the last
word in extending duration, so that's what we used.  Why not?  Wall of
Force is a dismissable spell, so it wasn't like it would be sitting
there taking up space for all eternity.</p>


<p>
As soon as the Wall was up and Permanenced, Matthew cast a Wall of
Iron into the supporting loops of the cranes, producing a flat sheet
of iron three quarters of an inch thick, six feet high, and four
hundred feet long.  It weighed in at over thirty-six tons; the cranes
creaked under the weight, but they took it.
</p>

<p>
From there it was easy; the stevedors spun the crane's windlasses,
lowering the Wall of Iron quickly but smoothly onto the Wall of Force.
The stevedors on the guideropes controlled it carefully as it
descended so it would fall exactly where needed.
</p>

<p>
A Wall of Iron is a sheet of normal iron and therefore subject to the
normal laws of physics&mdash;oxidation, gravity, mass, volume,
shearing, and so on.  A Wall of Force is a plane of mystical energy
that stares physics firmly in the eye, sticks out its tongue and says
"Neener, neener!" while wiggling its fingers in its ears.  It is
absolutely immobile, absolutely indestructible by any physical
force...and, since, unlike every other Wall spell, the Rules As
Written say nothing about thickness, it is absolutely two dimensional.
In short, it is the most amazing knife imaginable, and it slid through
the iron like a hot knife through olive oil.
</p>

<p>
The Wall of Force had been carefully shaped in such a way as to slice
the iron into various sizes depending on their purpose, without
slicing the ropes.  As soon as the segments hit the ground, more
stevedors leaped forward, grabbed them, and dragged them away to make
room for the next.  Even as they did, the men at the windlasses were
cranking furiously, pulling the rope loops back above the level of the
Wall of Force.  At which point another Wall of Iron was cast and
sliced, and then another, and another.
</p>

<p>


As the workmen settled into a rhythm, I took some casters aside and
got into the next phase.
</p>

<p>
In a D&D world, even though the Crafting rules make it impossible to
actually create anything in a sane time period, there's a really cool
hack for manufacturing many simple things quickly: use Shrink Item to
get the raw material (in this case, iron) to a manageable size and
change it into cloth.  Cut the cloth, roll it, even stitch it with a
few threads taken from the side of it, then restore it to normal. If
you need the iron to be thicker, cut the cloth into pieces, stack the
pieces on top of each other and use a series of Mendings to meld them
together before you unshrink them.
</p>

<p>
There are other tricks too&mdash;for example, use a quill to make a very
faint, very tightly packed, impression in the cloth.  Restore it to
normal and you have iron with a faint groove covering its surface.
Pile copper pieces on it and hit everything with a Fireball; the
copper melts and some of it flows into the grooves.  The iron isn't
affected, so you can scrape off the excess molten copper, let the
whole mess cool, and Shrink it again.  Very carefully pull the copper
thread out of the resulting cloth and enlarge everything; voila,
several thousand feet of copper wire.
</p>

<p>
The fun doesn't stop there, though.  Wrap the copper wire as many
times as you can around an iron bar and repeatedly slam electrical
spells through it to get a powerful bar magnet.  Put that magnet in
the center of an axle with enough grease that the magnet can spin
independently of the axle.  Add a copper tube around the magnet, a
wooden frame supporting a power takeoff (a set of copper brushes
hanging down onto the tube and a thick cable leading off to the side)
and you've got a sweet little generator.  I wasn't sure exactly how
much power it was putting out, but some very crude tests suggested
that the answer was somewhere between 'a crapton' and 'a metric
buttload'.  It certainly succeeded in vaporing a bucket of water right
quick, which was all I really needed it to do.
</p>

<p>
We had about a dozen casters who could cast Wall of Iron at least once
per day, as well as a lot of scrolls, wands, and whatevers that could
cast it.  There were also plenty of Shrink Items available and an
enormous number of Mending spells&mdash;all of the apprentices had
that at least once, as well as the actual magi.
</p>

<p>
Over the course of that day we manufactured about sixty cannon barrels
and hundred of cannonballs.  We made the cannon small but nicely
tricked out&mdash;six feet long, four inch inner bore diameter, rear
trunnions, rear towbar, and front axles mounting large oaken wheels.
All up they weighed about six hundred and fifty pounds, so a team of
eight average men could lift and carry one.  Mount that team on mules
and the guns could be deployed quickly into nearly any terrain.  Their
only drawback was that they were smoothbore, not rifled, so accuracy
wouldn't be great.
</p>

<p>
Of course, when you've got a giant shotgun that blasts over a hundred
one-inch iron balls at a few hundred soldiers from several football
fields away, accuracy really isn't that important.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the cannons, we made thousands of cannonballs of
varying sizes and types, nearly as many bar magnets and copper tubes,
hundreds of feet of thick copper cable, and literally miles of the
thin copper wire that was used to create the bar magnets.  Actually,
we made so many of everything that there weren't enough hands to bag
up all the cannonballs or stack all the cannons.  All of the workmen
were scrambling at top speed just to keep up with the constant flow of
materiel coming from the hands of the magi.
</p>

<p>
But we didn't just produce cannons; we also produced accidents.
Within the first two hours, four workers had feet or hands crushed by
dropped cannons, and two men got bad electrical burns when they
accidentally spun the magnet on a generator while carrying it.  By an
amazing coincidence, however, there happened to be a dozen high level
paladins nearby who were able to heal all the damage.  Afterwards, I
sent the formerly-injured men home for the day with my thanks in their
ears and a large bonus in their pockets.
</p>

<p>
What the Landguard could not heal, however, was the man who was cut in
half and killed when he accidentally stumbled into the end of the Wall
of Force.  When I saw that, I started to shout for a doctor, then
realized that there weren't any in this world.
</p>

<p>
"Bob, Aerith!  Get a cleric who can resurrect him.  Don't worry about
money, just go!" I said loudly.  Almost before the words were out of
my mouth, Bob and Aerith were sprinting off in different directions.
Both were moving at speeds that would have torn the spots off a
cheetah&mdash;and they did it while wearing full armor and carrying
weapons.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing further I could do to deal with the situation which
left me with lots of adrenaline and nothing to do with it.  My mind
spun in circles, looking for something useful to do or think about so
that it didn't have to register the two bleeding halves of a human
being on the ground a few yards away. Ninety seconds ago, he had been
a man, probably with a family and certainly with hopes, dreams, and
plans; now he was a couple of chunks of meat not too different from
what the vendors around the Plaza were selling.
</p>

<p>
And, of course, my weirdo brain fixed on something completely
pointless.  "Ok, Thomas," I demanded, turning to the head of my
protective detachment.  "What the hell?  Fantasy world, fine.  Magical
powers, fine.  But I simply refuse to believe that every single member
of the Landguard just so happens to be a world-class sprinter on top
of everything else.  What gives?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas flicked his eyes around, checking that noone was near, and then
spoke in a jailyard whisper.  "We live under permanent Haste spells,
Jake.  Beyond that, don't ask here.  Later, when we're in the Work
Room and under shields."
</p>

<p>
My eyebrow did the Spock thing, but I didn't push it.  Instead, I
moved over to the body and stood there, gloomily contemplating what I
had caused.  Finally I sighed and looked around.
</p>

<p>
No one in the square was working.  They were all staring at
me&mdash;most of them with expressions of resentment and anger for
bringing them to work on this apparently pointless, dangerous task.  A
very few were looking surprised and perhaps a bit impressed that I was
providing an expensive and rare Resurrection spell for a simple
dockworker.
</p>

<p>
It was almost a full hour before Aerith came back with a cleric in
tow.  She was a tall, skeletally thin woman with coal-black skin and a
sheer black veil.  Her face, easily seen through the veil, showed her
to be very old; her skin was as wrinkled as a dried apple, lines of
age and experience drawn across it like roads on a map.  Despite that,
she moved so smoothly and gracefully that she seemed to float.
</p>

<p>
The crowd parted in front of her like the Red Sea; the expressions on
most of the faces were fear, not respect.  She paid no attention,
looking straight ahead, walking slowly and calmly to the body.
</p>

<p>
She examined the remains carefully, pacing slowly in a circle around
them, examining them from all angles.  Upon completing her circuit, she
dropped to one knee, dabbed a finger in the blood, and tasted it
thoughtfully, as one might taste a fine wine to determine its
varietal.
</p>

<p>
Slowly, she rose to her feet and faced me.  This close, I could see
her eyes through the veil; they were an unusually bright brown, nearly
gold, and terrifyingly still.  Her entire body was like
that&mdash;completely motionless.  Normal people are never completely
motionless; they sway slightly as they subconsciously maintain
balance, they swallow, they blink...at the very least their chest
rises and falls as they breathe.
</p>

<p>
She did none of that.  She stood like she was outside of Time itself,
staring at me.  It was the creepiest thing I'd ever seen, and I found
my eyes locked immovably on hers like the mouse locked to the gaze of
the cobra.
</p>

<p>
After a solid minute of silence, she spoke a single word in a voice
that sounded like it was drifting up from the bottom of a deep well:
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
I stood paralyzed, not knowing what she was asking but absolutely
certain that giving the correct answer was vital.  An eternity later,
I managed to push words through my throat.
</p>

<p>
"Because his death is my responsiblity."
</p>

<p>
She considered my answer for the single longest moment of my life
before nodding; her aura of otherness retreated slightly.  She still
commanded all the respect due a ruling matriarch upon her throne, but
not the stark awe-filled terror due a living avatar of Death.
</p>

<p>
"You will create a new seat at the Conclave table, co-equal to the
rest, to be filled by whomever the minor churches select."
</p>

<p>
I was opening my mouth to assent when a commanding voice rang out
across the Plaza, "Stop!"
</p>

<p>
All eyes, even those of the high priestess of Death, swiveled to the
source of that clarion voice.  The Archpriest of Flobovia swept
towards us, white robes catching the late morning sun so that he
seemed to glow.  Behind him came a flying wedge of the six High
Priests, all in full regalia.
</p>

<p>
"My Lord," said the Archpriest, speaking with the charisma and
projection of a world leader, "It is not necessary to pay this woman
of the Dark God such a high price.  I shall return this man's life, as
is my sacred duty to the nation, for the sake of justice instead of
power-grubbing avarice."
</p>

<p>
I raised an eyebrow and looked again at the priestess in black.
Through her veil I could see just the tiniest hint of a sardonic
smile, but she said nothing.  Instead she just stood calmly, looking
at me and completely ignoring the Archpriest.
</p>

<p>
I'm no good at all with political shenanigans, but something odd was
clearly happening here; there had to be a catch somewhere.  I felt
like I was wading through glue as I tried to figure out what it might
be.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the issue was something that I would need to provide?
Something expensive or that would give the recipient power over me?
"That's a very kind offer, your Benevolence.  Will you need anything
in order to perform the ritual?  Spell components or such?"
</p>

<p>
"No, thank you.  There is no need for you to put yourself out; the
True Church will provide all that I require," he said in the tone of a
kind parent graciously granting an ice cream to a favorite child.
</p>

<p>
I nodded absently, still thinking my way through it.  "And you, High
Priestess?  Is there anything you would require, aside from the
Conclave seat?"  I had no idea what the correct form of address for
her was, but I figured that 'High Priestess' was as good a shot as
any.
</p>

<p>
"No."  Her voice was quiet, but nonetheless it carried around the
Plaza.
</p>

<p>
Ok, that wasn't it.  I cudgeled my brain, trying to figure out what I
was missing.  Clearly, the Archpriest didn't want the minor churches
getting a seat at the Conclave table&mdash;presumably because it would be
a dilution of the power of his own church.  Was there more to it?
Would I gain an enemy whichever one I chose?  Probably.  Would I end
up owing one of them a service?  I didn't know.
</p>

<p>
I looked to Thomas for help.  In a nearly silent whisper he asked
"when?" with a head tilt towards the Archpriest.
</p>

<p>
It took a moment to figure out what he meant, but I got it.  "When
would you be prepared to begin?" I asked, addressing both of them.
</p>

<p>
The Archpriest paused, clearly looking for a weasel wording.  "I will
need some little time to request this favor from the True God, but
there will be no risk of losing the man's soul.  He can be brought
back tomorrow as easily as today."
</p>

<p>
The priestess waited until he finished, then merely responded: "Now."
Throughout the Archpriest's speech she never once glanced at him;
strangely, it did not seem that she was acting petty by giving her
rival the silent treatment.  Instead, it was as though she were simply
ignoring an utterly irrelevant element of her world, such as a leaf on
a tree she happened to be walking past.
</p>

<p>
I nodded thoughtfully, understanding.  The priestess had the spell
memorized, the Archpriest didn't.  Either one of them could bring the
man back; the only difference was if it happened now or tomorrow
morning. 
</p>

<p>
Of course, there were other differences.  Allowing the Archpriest to
do it would help to cement my tacit alliance with him and likely win
me his continued support in the Conclave.  It probably wouldn't cost
much either; as far as I could tell, the minor churches had very
little political power and they were highly unlikely to try to harm me
physically.  
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, having the high priestess do it would mean
granting the minor churches a position of significant political power
in Flobovia...and, with that thought, the rest of the implications
unfolded in my mind life an evil flower.
</p>

<p>
Granting the minor churches political power would seriously upset the
religious status quo; worst case, it could lead to direct strife
between the churches.  Also, creating a Conclave seat for the minor
churches would set an important precedent, and open up a can of
worms&mdash;if there could be two seats for a given segment of the
populous, why not three? Or ten?  Could the ruler pack the Conclave
with his supporters, simply by creating the needed seats, thereby
gaining absolute control of the nation?  If seats could be created,
could they be removed?  Could a ruler use that method to close off an
entire segment of the population from representation?
</p>

<p>
And if I added a new chair, it would turn at least some of the
Conclave against me.  Not to mention it would do strange things to the
dynamics of the Conclave itself.  The two clerics would probably be at
each others' throats on every issue, polarizing the Conclave.  And, of
course, there would now be eight seats, allowing for deadlocks.  And,
in this case, deadlocks could be a good or bad thing: a deadlocked
Conclave would be unable to muck around in the affairs of the nation,
thereby increasing the ruler's power.  But increasing the ruler's
power was dangerous when the ruler rotated every two years and some of
them were ineffective or abusive.
</p>

<p>
And, of course, whichever choice I made, a crowd of a few thousand
citizens would see that choice, thereby setting their impression of
me.
</p>

<p>
By now, my head was splitting from all this political quicksand.
There was no good choice, so instead I did what I felt was right.
</p>

<p>
"Your Benevolence, thank you very much for your kind offer, but I
can't allow this man to stay dead longer than necessary.  He has a
family to go home to, and an employer who needs him.  This is not
intended as an insult, and I hope you won't take it that way, but I
have to allow the High Priestess to cast the spell immediately."
</p>

<p>
Figuring I might as well make at least a little hay out of this given
all the trouble it would cause, I faced her squarely and projected as
clearly as I could.  "High Priestess, would you please bring this man
back?  The minor churches will have their Conclave seat as soon as
they choose their representative."
</p>

<p>
She nodded without speaking, then paced solemnly to the remains.  With
unexpected strength for such an old woman, she gently lifted the left
half of the body and laid it respectfully next to the right.  Removing
her veil, she draped it over the man's face as though laying a blanket
on a sleeping child.  She studied him for a moment, then gently
scooped up a handful of the mostly-coagulated blood and dabbed it on
her forehead, cheeks, and eyelids.
</p>

<p>
Pacing slowly around the body, she faced across it to the north,
raised the small pool of blood in her cupped hands in offering, and
spoke to the sky.
</p>

<p>
<center>  
            Northern Death, cut too soon, cut too short <br />
                          God of Terror<br />
                           God of Fear<br />
                  Knees to water, hearts to lead<br />
                           Look aside<br />
                         Close your eyes<br />
</center>
</p>

<p>
She lowered her hands and bowed her head in respect.  A minute crawled
by, then another.  Finally she raised her head and paced a quarter
turn clockwise around the body.  Turning so that she faced across
the body to the east, she raised her hands and spoke again.
</p>

<p>
  <center>
            Eastern Death, reaping old, growing youth <br />
                        God of Need <br />
                          God of Green <br />
                 Regret and sorrow, need and joy <br />
                           Look aside <br />
                         Close your eyes <br />
</center>
</p>

<p>
Again she bowed in respect.  Again she paced a quarter turn, faced
across the body, and raised her hands to the sky.
</p>

<p>
<center>  
            Southern Death, pain ender, disease curer <br />
                        God of Surcease <br />
                         God of Relief <br />
               Relief and regret, tears and wishes <br />
                           Look aside <br />
                         Close your eyes <br />
</center>
</p>

<p>
Another bow, another quarter turn, and she raised her hands a fourth
time.
</p>

<p>
<center>  
            Western Death, good friend, kind friend <br />
                        God of Welcome <br />
                         God of Peace <br />
               Gently freed, loved and remembered <br />
                           Look aside <br />
                         Close your eyes <br />
</center>  
</p>

<p>
She bowed a final time, then paced forward, knelt by the body and
removed the veil from his face.  She lay it carefully aside before
cradling the man's head in both hands.  The pool of dried, blackened
blood around them softened immediately into bright liquid crimson and
flowed back into the gaping wounds.  Where it entered, the separated
body parts moved together, new tissue growing and knitting them shut.
When the blood was all gone from the ground she bent down and kissed
the man's forehead softly, as a mother kisses an infant.  The blood on
her brow, cheeks, and eyes softened and flowed downwards, across his
face, across his throat and chest, finally sinking through the skin
over his heart.
</p>

<p>
His eyes drifted open like someone waking from a good night's sleep.
He lay there for a moment, blinking, and staring up at her.  She
waited patiently, still supporting his head and smiling softly.
Finally, he sat up and looked around.
</p>

<p>
An awed murmur passed through the crowd.  None of the normal people in
this Plaza had seen a resurrection before; to all of us, death was an
end, a horror and a misery to be avoided at all costs.  Now, we had
been shown an inkling that perhaps death was more than that, that it
had a kindly face as well.  It was a profound moment for all of us,
and I felt deeply honored to have been part of it.
</p>

<p>
The priestess helped her patient to his feet and brought him to me.
</p>

<p>
"Leon, this is the man who brought you back," she told him gently.
There was nothing terrible or terrifying left in her; she seemed like
a wise and kindly grandmother, straight from Leave It To Beaver or Mrs
Piggle Wiggle.
</p>

<p>
I stared at her in astonishment; I had had nothing to do with Leon's
resurrection outside of a bit of political horse trading.
</p>

<p>
"Uhh...thank you, High Priestess, but you did this, not me."
</p>

<p>
She smiled.  "A fire gives heat only when the builder lights it."
</p>

<p>
My brain was still pretty scrambled by what I had just seen, but I
couldn't keep one thought out: any second now, she was going to say
"when you can snatch the pebble from my hand, grasshopper...."  Or
maybe at the end of her sentences she would start putting her verbs,
yes?
</p>

<p>
Leon bobbed his head to me, looking like he'd be holding his cap in
his hands if he had a cap.  "Thank you, M'Lord.  Thank you very much.
I'm a dockworker, I know I can't pay...."
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.  "Leon, don't worry about it.  I should have ordered
the ends of the Wall to be folded back so that this couldn't happen,
but I didn't think of it.  Your death was my fault, and I had to make
it right."  I smiled quirkily.  "Tell you what&mdash;you promise not to
report me to OSHA and we'll call it even."
</p>

<p>
He stared at me, forehead creased in bafflement.  "I won't tell a
soul, M'Lord, I promise.  No one.  Not even my wife.  I swear."
</p>

<p>
I laughed and waved him off.  "It's ok, Leon, it was a joke.  A small
one. Almost invisible, actually.  But feel free to tell anyone you
want&mdash;after all, a couple of thousand people were watching and
saw the whole thing, so it's not like we could keep it a secret.
</p>

<p>
"Anyway, let me give you a bonus&mdash;call it hazard pay, for being
forced to work in unsafe conditions&mdash;and you take the rest of the
day off.  Spend it with your family."
</p>

<p>
He shook his head fast, like a dog shaking off water.  "No, M'Lord,
please, I can work."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you Leon, but&mdash;" I was halfway through repeating my suggestion
that he go home when, from the corner of my eye, I caught Thomas'
millimetric headshake, so I quickly switched to a new end to the
sentence.  "&mdash;I was just about to call a lunch break, so go eat before
you go back to work.  And thank you."
</p>

<p>
After Leon's resurrection, the workers' attitudes completely reversed;
they still didn't understand why I wanted them to do all these strange
things, but they no longer cared. I had shown my dedication to them,
and they meant to return it in kind.  They set to it with a will; many
of the apprentice casters were dispatched by their masters to go and
fetch other casters and other apprentices who hadn't shown up in the
morning.  The stevedors were no longer grudging about their tasks;
they practically ran from place to place as they shifted loads and
stuffed cannonballs into sacks.  The magi burned up spells with
abandon and then sent their apprentices off to fetch scrolls, rings,
wands and more exotic items.  They produced so many cannon,
cannonballs, magnets, and wire that the stevedors couldn't keep up;
the stuff started piling up here and there around the Plaza.
</p>

<p>
In addition, many of the random people from the crowd around the Plaza
started helping.  This was a mixed blessing; they were willing, but
they lacked the experience, strength, and stamina of the
professionals, so they tended to get in the way as much or more than
they helped.  To make matters worse, the crowd that didn't choose to
pitch in still crowded closer to watch, and they were definitely in
the way.  Moreover, there just weren't enough hands available to keep
them back without significantly reducing the rate of work.
</p>

<p>
After a while of fruitlessly asking the crowd to stay back Thomas sent
for troops.  A short time later, two companies of the Landguard and
five of the regular army showed up, all in full battle rattle, to form
a cordon around the square.  It took some effort, but they finally
managed to press the gawkers back to a convenient distance.
Occasionally one of them would pop up, prairie dog-like, to look over
the shoulders of the guardian soldiers, but for the most part they
contented themselves with watching from afar.  Work picked up again
once they were out of the way.
</p>

<p>
We didn't knock off until the sun was near the horizon, by which time
the magi were out of spells and the longshoremen were exhausted.
</p>

<p>
"Great job, everyone," I told them with the best impression of
'inspiring boss' that I could manage.  I didn't think it was a
particularly good impression but from the looks I was getting you
would think I had just given the Gettysburg Address.  I looked around
and saw exausted but pleased faces so I decided to quit while I was
ahead.  "I'll see you all tomorrow, same time, same spells.  G'night."
With that, I beat a hasty retreat, the Landguard following.
</p>

<p>

We didn't head back to the castle though.  I had my Landguard detail
follow me out of the city with two of the few fully assembled cannons,
and a fair amount of ammunition.  (When I discovered that an
extradimensiobal backpack was standard issue for the 'Guards, "a fair
amount" became rather more like "oh my aching back.")
</p>

<p>
With a bit of effort, we got the cannon across the clear-cut area
immediately around the city, through the wheat field, and near the
edge of the Royal Forest.
</p>

<p>
I started futzing around, checking the first cannon over, making sure
there weren't any obvious problems.  Truth to tell, I was a little
nervous about the test firing.
</p>

<p>
Finally, when I couldn't find anything wrong, I pulled on my big boy
pants and got ready to blow the crap out of some trees.
</p>

<p>
That was when I noticed one of today's bodyguards standing beside me,
shaking his head minutely with a frown; most likely, he didn't even
realize he was doing it.  I thought it was Rob but wasn't sure (really
not good with faces here).
</p>

<p>
"Problem, Rob?" I asked, taking a gamble on his name.
</p>

<p>
He looked at me sideways just a bit.  "If you please M'Lord&mdash;Robert.
As you know, there's a Rob on my squad," (he nodded briefly to one of
his men), "so we try to be careful about distinguishing our names."
</p>

<p>
"Right, sorry, my bad.  Anyway...something's bothering you, what is
it?"
</p>

<p>
He paused for a moment, clearly evaluating how to diplomatically
suggest that his ruler was completely around the bend bonkers.
</p>

<p>
"I was...curious, M'Lord, about our purpose here.  These toys you
make...tubes and metal balls, I'm not sure how you can consider them
weapons."
</p>

<p>
Now it was my turn to frown.  "They aren't toys," I said defensively.
"Look, these things are going to blow Deorsi troops into sausage, like
I said.  We'll need to test them, of course, to verify what their
operational parameters are, but I'm sure they'll be fine.  And
then&mdash;sausage, really."
</p>

<p>
He backpedaled quickly.  "Of course, M'Lord.  I'm sure they will be
very successful.  Perhaps I simply don't know enough about them to
appreciate them properly."
</p>

<p>
I waved him over to the nearer cannon.  "It's dead easy," I told him,
pointing at the various pieces as I walked him through it. "You pour
some water down the barrel&mdash;preferably salt water because it
conducts better, but whatever you've got.  It puddles in this small
depression here.  You ram some wadding down the barrel and pour your
ammo on top of that.  Next, run an electrical current through this
cable that comes in from the top and reaches into the depression.  The
water is electrolyzed into hydrogen and oxygen gases and the water level
drops.  When enough of the water has been electrolyzed, the cable is
exposed; a spark arcs from the cable to the inside of the barrel and
detonates the gases.  The explosion blasts the wadding and the ammo
out the barrel at the enemy.  It'll come out fast and full of hate;
anything in front of it is going to be in a world of pain."  I grinned
savagely.
</p>

<p>
As excited as I was about the idea of the cannon, I had to laugh at
myself just a bit for using the expression 'fast and full of hate.'
Yes, it sounded all kinds of tough and macho, but the truth was
somewhat different; I had heard it from the instructor at a riflery
course once, and it was pretty much the only time I had ever used a
firearm in my life.  I had taken one of those weekend-warrior courses
given by Barrett Rifles; the instructor had been a former Force Marine
Recon sniper, a man completely entitled to use manly phrases like
'fast and full of hate' when talking about manly subjects such as
rifle ammunition.  I, as a whitebread geek from the suburbs with no
military service to my name, was not similarly entitled.  Despite
that, I'd never been able to resist such language.
</p>

<p>
All through my little internal monoluge, Robert had been staring at me
with the look normally reserved for people who are in desperate need
of a "hug myself" jacket.  Now he cleared his throat and said, in a
remarkably casual voice, "Yes, well, I'm sure all of
these...things...will be helpful at some point.  But are they really
the best way to spend an entire day and all that magic, M'Lord?"
</p>

<p>
Now I was feeling downright defensive.  The fact that none of the
other Landguard, including Thomas, had spoken up suggested that they
were all having the same doubts.  "Look, just trust me, ok?  It'll
work."
</p>

<p>
"As you say, M'Lord," he responded, just like the excellent soldier he
was.  He still looked dubious.
</p>

<p>
Now I was sweating bullets; I really hoped this worked, because if it
didn't I was in a lot of trouble.  In retrospect I should have built
one cannon and tested it before going into mass production.  My brain
quickly threw up the defense that doing it that way would still have
required building the cranes and deploying the same high-level spells
so it was just more efficient to have done it on a mass basis right
from the start and that I had subconsiously recognized that right from
the start and thay's why I had gone ahead as I had.  It was very
comforting to realize that.
</p>

<p>
Of course, it was also a total lie.  I had not thought any such thing,
I had just plowed ahead with an idea for a cool new toy that I was
excited about.
</p>

<p>
Holy crap but I was praying this would work.  If I'd ever been able to
believe in something as fundamentally nutty as a god, I'd have been
praying in earnest.  Although, come to think of it, the gods (plural!)
of this world were very demonstrably real, so being unwilling to
sincerely pray was a bit nutty in and of itself.  Meh, whatever.
</p>

<p>
I had done client demos before where the software wasn't really ready
to be shown.  That could be managed with a little razzle-dazzle; you
stepped around the landmines, pointed at the good bits even if they
were trivial, talked fast and sounded positive throughout.  It worked
surprisingly well because (a) non-programmers don't understand
software and (b) most people are gullible and/or stupid.  This
situation, however, was a whole other level; an audience that severely
doubted me, on whom I was dependent literally for my survival, with a
product that would either function or not function, period.  No fancy
footwork was going to help here.
</p>

<p>
I forced a confident smile and said, "Ok, let's do this.  Duncan,
you've still got that handy instant-water thing, right?  Pour&mdash;". I
suddenly realized that I had no idea how much water would be
required. 
</p>

<p>
"Pour a gallon of salt water down the barrel, if you would," I told
him.  That was less than I thought would really be needed, but I
figured it was a lot like cooking; you could always increase the
amount of spice, but you couldn't take it out once it was in.  Duncan
did as I asked, looking dubious.
</p>

<p>
Once he was out of the way, I draped a loop of cable around the barrel
and let it trail on the ground; without a grounding strap this either
wouldn't work or, more likely, it would kill us all.  Next I took some
of the wire that was attached to the generator and carefully pushed it
through the insulated hole in the side and diagonally down until I
felt it touch the bottom.  Pulling it out an inch I backed away
slowly, paying the wire out as I went.  In combat the generator would
be beside the cannon so the wire wouldn't sag signicantly, but for
this test I wanted a bit more distance so I draped the wire over the
aiming wedges to prevent it from touching the ground.
</p>

<p>
Once the Landguard, the generator, and my tender self were all behind
the second cannon, I checked everything over one last time and then
turned to the Landguard to give what I sincerely hoped were not going
to be final instructions.
</p>

<p>
"In a moment I'm going to crank the generator to create artificial
lightning.  Once I start cranking, stay low and behind this cannon.
Do NOT touch the wire or it might kill you, got it?"  Everyone nodded.
"Ok, let's do this."
</p>

<p>
I took the generator's crank handle in both hands and took a deep
breath.  If I hadn't been an atheist I would have said a quick prayer,
but as it was I just hoped really hard and started cranking as fast as
I could.
</p>

<p>
The handle spun the bar magnet in the center of the generator.  The
thing was heavy as hell and my shoulders and biceps were on fire
within a few seconds, but I kept it turning.  It had a crazy huge
amount of inertia, so once I got it moving all I had to do was keeping
adding energy, much like pumping a swing.  Sweat popped out on my
forehead and ran into my eyes; I took one hand off for a split second
to wipe my face of my sleeve, but was still blinking the salt away as
I got both hands back to work.
</p>

<p>
After about a minute of cranking, there was a giant BOOM!, the
grapeshot flew out of the barrel and utterly shredded the trees
downrange.  Larger trees were chewed up, fragments the size of spears
flying in all directions. Several of the smaller trees were actually
knocked down by the force of the shot.  Birds, startled at the sound,
blasted out of the trees, flapping off in all directions.  The
Landguard stood, jaws sagging in amazement.  Finally Duncan turned to
me and stuck out his hand to shake.  "I take back all the nasty things
I said about you, M'Lord.  You truly are a genius, and I'm very
confident you'll save our country.  Those poor Deorsi bastards are
screwed, blued, and tattooed!  These cannon of yours will chew 'em up
and spit 'em out.  I was wrong about you lad, and I'm truly grateful
that you are our Lord."
</p>

<p>
Oh wait.  None of that happened.
</p>

<p>
Instead, the cannon just sat there, sneering at me in its immobility
and silence.  I stopped cranking the generator after I couldn't do any
more, my arms screaming at me in loud voices and threatening to secede
from my body.  I stood, shaking them out as I stared at the cannon
with narrowed eyes.  A shiver went down my spine as I realized what
the reaction of the 'Guards was going to be; it felt like seventy
seven black cats had just walked over my grave, pointing out to the
universe all the ways in which my beautiful cannon would fail.
Firmly, I pushed those thoughts to one side and focused down on the
problem.  Everything faded away as I locked my entire mind around the
issue and shook it like a ragdoll, demanding that a solution fall out.
</p>

<p>
"Well?  Where's the earth shattering kaboom?  Wasn't there supposed to
be some sort of great big impressive boom?" sneered Duncan.  Thomas
opened his mouth to say something and I just held my hand up in a Stop
gesture.  I was too focused on the problem to have social graces, and
definitely too focused to be interrupted.
</p>

<p>
I carefully disengaged the power takeoff from the generator and walked
over to the cannon, only vaguely aware that the Landguard were
trailing behind. I stood, frowning at this giant lump of recalcitrant
metal for a long minute, brows furrowed and eyes unfocused as I traced
the system for the point of failure.
</p>

<p>
"My Lord, we should&mdash;" said Thomas.  Without even facing him, I
snapped my fingers and held up a hand to shut him up, not even aware I
was doing it. I was getting more deeply embedded in the problem by the
moment, too deep to be aware of him as more than a vaguely irritating
distraction.
</p>

<p>
<em>~We added the water, so there's plenty of fuel.  The wire is in
place, so it should have carried the current to split the water into
gas.  Once the water was out of the way, the wire would spark,
detonating the gasses and firing the cannon.  Gunpowder could be a
dud, but how in the hell could hydrogen gas be a dud?~</em> I thought
to myself angrily, deep in the vault of my own skull.
</p>

<p><em>~Maybe we didn't add enough water?  How much did Duncan
actually put in?~</em> I hadn't watched the exact amount; maybe he was
playing games with me again, testing to see how I would deal with
apparent failure?  It was a crappy time for games, but that made the
theory seem all the more likely.</p>

<p>
"Get the ammo and wadding out," I said to the air, still staring at
the cannon like I could burn a hole in it with my brain.
</p>

<p>
They didn't exactly hop to it, but they did it.  A minute or two later
the grapeshot and wadding were on the ground to one side and I was
tipping the barrel down, watching a few drops of water run out.
</p>

<p>
Only a few drops.  I knew Duncan had put in more than that.  So where
was the rest?  Had there not been enough?  But we should at least have
heard the detonation if&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"M'Lord, we need to go back." Thomas stepped forward and laid a hand
on my shoulder; I shook him off in irritation, still focused on the
problem.  His voice stayed polite but acquired a sharper edge. "It was
a good attempt, M'Lord, but it <em>failed.</em>  We need to tell the
mages and the workers not to come tomorrow; we will need them working
on other things instead of wasting magic on this."
</p>

<p>
<em>~If there was water and now there isn't, that means it got
electrolyzed.  But if it was electrolyzed, it should have detonated,
and there was no detonation noise. So if the gas didn't detonate, what
happened to it?  Did the wire not spark?~</em> I was idly running my
hands over the barrel, puzzling.  Distractedly, I tugged on the
ignition wire and felt it sliding back and forth through the tightly
coiled leather that insulated the ignition hole and sealed it against
escaping gas.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly I flashed back to a MacGyver episode, in which Mac wet down a
sack to contain hydrogen gas, because the hydrogen molecules were
small enough that they would have slipped through the cloth otherwise.
That was it.  The seals weren't good enough; the water was split over
the course of twenty or thirty seconds; as fast as it was produced,
the hydrogen and oxygen leaked out around the ignition wire and
through the wadding.
</p>

<p>
Thomas put his hand on my shoulder firmly, forcibly turning me to face
him.  He was clearly getting ticked.  "My Lord.  We are leaving.  I'll
send some people to bring these things back in the morning, but we're
leaving <em>now</em>.  Come along."  He started back towards the city;
only in politest terms would it be fair to say that his hand on my
shoulder was 'guiding' me instead of, oh say, 'dragging' me.
</p>

<p>
I twisted out from under him.  "Hang on, I know what happened.  This
will work, we just have to try again."
</p>

<p>
Thomas frowned openly, his patience running thin.  "These toys of
yours don't work, My Lord.  Face it and let's move on.  We wasted a
full day on this; we need to stop chasing an escaped horse and start
coming up with something that is actually effective."  Behind him the
other Landguard were nodding in agreement; all of them looked quietly
pissed to have wasted a day and then been dragged out here for a
completely spectacular failure.
</p>

<p>
I was shaking my head.  "No, we're doing another shoot.  I know what
the problem was, I can fix it."
</p>

<p>
"Admit it, you screwed the pooch, boy!" Duncan growled.  "This idiocy
of yours wasted the entire day and a huge amount of magic and
accomplished absolutely nothing.  Now shut your mouth and get back to
the castle, doubletime!  There's actual work to do, instead of messing
around with oversized toys!"
</p>

<p>
A combination of frustration and defensiveness surged up in me and
gave me the steel to plant my feet and snap back at him.  "It
was <em>not</em> a goddamn waste!  These things will <em>work</em>, I
just need to make one fix."
</p>

<p>
The Commander of the Landguard had run completely out of patience with
his ruler.  "Gods damn it, stop!  We are not wasting any more time on
these ridiculous things.  Now come on!"  He reached for my shoulder
again, clearly intending to take no further nonsense even if it meant
literally dragging me away.
</p>

<p>
"Stand down, Commander!" I snapped.  He jolted to a halt, his face
thunderous and growing worse by the moment.
</p>

<p>
I really didn't care.  The rage was rolling through me, too, and I had
lost any trace of caring.  "All of you, shut it!  We are doing another
shoot, so get that cannon reloaded right the hell now!  That is a
direct order!"
</p>

<p>
That stopped them.  They stood for a moment, eyeing me much like you
would eye someone who had just totaled your car; you weren't allowed
to punch them in the face but oh boy did you want to.  Slowly, they
moved back to the cannon.  Duncan produced his flask again and poured
more salt water down the barrel.  I had him put in quite a bit more
this time, just to be sure.  And I stood over him to make sure he did
it. Finally, the water, wadding, and shot were in and we were back
behind the second cannon.
</p>

<p>
I checked that the power takeoff was up, disengaged from the generator
so that power wouldn't flow.  "Robert, start cranking, fast as you
can."  He looked at Thomas for direction; Thomas gave him a
disgruntled nod, thinking 'do it so we can get this stupid thing over
with' so loudly that I was pretty sure they could hear it back in the
castle.
</p>

<p>
Robert stepped forward and pushed on the crank with one hand,
surprised when it barely moved.  Despite watching me sweat for it, he
hadn't understood just how heavy the damn thing was.  Frowning
thunderously, he set his feet, took a deep breath, and started
spinning that crank, slowly at first but speeding up quickly until it
was flying around like a pinwheel.  I should have thought of this
earlier; my body worked on biology, so I got tired after a few dozen
seconds of heavy exertion.  Their bodies ran on some weird crazy-town
pseudoscience; the only way they got tired was by marching too long,
staying awake too long, or being hit with magic.
</p>

<p>
As Robert cranked, power was generated.  With the takeoff disengaged
there was nowhere for it to go so the electrons clung to the outer rim
of the copper shell, building up a massive static charge like a Van
Der Graff generator.  I let the power build and build until every hair
on my body was standing out straight and, just before the power arced
on its own, I dropped the power takeoff into place, yanking my hand
away as it fell.
</p>

<p>
A thunderbolt crack! split the air as the built up power lanced down
the cable and into the cannon, followed so closely by the cannon blast
that the two sounded almost as one.  As I had hoped, the trick was to
use a massive charge to electrolyze and detonate the water before the
gas could escape.  
</p>

<p>
Reaching up to move the power takeoff meant that I had to be standing
up, with my upper body exposed over the protective cannon that the
others were crouched behind.  Not even the Landguard were fast enough
to yank me to the ground when the explosion went off.  Something went
SPANG! off the body of the cannon we were hiding behind, passed my
head going way too fast, and crashed through the corner of the
generator's frame.  Simultaneously there was a sound like golf-ball
sized hail crashing into a tin roof at major-league-fastball speeds.
I ducked way too late to matter.
</p>

<p>
Everyone stood up slowly, ears ringing, and looked at the cannon that
we had fired.
</p>

<p>
The barrel was peeled open as though it had been unzipped, split
cleanly down a straight line on one side.  The edges of the split
were jagged; pieces had been blown off in all directions.  One very
large piece had gone flying past me and stuck itself in the ground a
few dozen yards away.  The cannon we had sheltered behind had multiple
divots in the side closest to the explosion.
</p>

<p>
As one man, the Landguard turned to me with accusing eyes.
</p>

<p>
I hurried to jump in before the recriminations could begin.  "Ok, yes,
need a smaller charge next time.  But look!"  I pointed downrange; a
hundred yards away, half a dozen trees were chewed up&mdash;stripped
of their lower bark and leaves, smaller branches wrenched off, large
pockmarks and gouges everywhere on their trunks.  It wasn't as
impressive as my fantasy from before, but it was still quite a bit of
damage.  It was fully obvious that, had those been men instead of
trees, they would have been thoroughly dead.
</p>

<p>
The 'Guardsmen considered the damage thoughtfully, then looked at each
other in some sort of weird silent conversation that consisted mostly
of facial expressions, shrugs, and small head gestures.  I guess
that's what happens when you live and train with the same small group
of people for years; words lose some of their necessity.  I envied
them that close connection.
</p>

<p>
They turned back to me; Thomas spoke for the group.  His voice was
still frosty, but at least it was no longer raging with contempt.
"Congratulations on an excellent attempt, M'Lord; the weapon clearly
causes damage at a reasonable range.  But a longbow can shoot
signicantly farther while being much easier to transport, a Fireball
does more damage at the same range or longer...and neither of them
blows up in the user's face."
</p>

<p>
I was clearly losing this crowd, so I scrambled to get things back on
the right track.  "First off, this is short range for a cannon, giving
it the edge over both longbows and Fireballs.  As to blowing up in
your face&mdash;like I said, we just use a smaller amount of water and
we're fine.
</p>

<p>
"But the important part is the numbers; a Fireball might do more
damage&mdash;maybe; I'm not willing to concede that point without more
tests&mdash;but they only come from people with class levels.  Even a
high-level mage doesn't have more than half a dozen Fireballs
available unless he's burning up scrolls, wands, or that kind of
thing.  A cannon can be operated by a crew of commoners with no class
levels.  The Deorsi probably have a few thousand magi, but we've got
millions of commoners."
</p>

<p>
That stopped them in their tracks.  The anger faded away, to be
replaced by surprise and thoughtfulness.  Thomas spoke slowly, clearly
working his way through the logic.  "That lets us mobilize the entire
populace, makes them effective enough to matter, and gives them enough
range that they don't get killed too quickly."  He stopped, looking
slightly gobsmacked.  "Zero-level people killing people with class
levels...I can hardly believe it."
</p>

<p>
After a moment, Robert spoke up, doubt still strong in his voice.  "If
we only get one shot from each cannon, it's not going to be worth the
effort."
</p>

<p>
Even as he spoke, I was moving to the cannon, examining what had
happened.  Upon closer examination, the blast had vented through the
ignition hole as much as through the barrel, vaporizing the ignition
wire itself and knocking the insulating leather out like a champagne
cork.  It had clearly reduced the power of the shot a lot from what I
had hoped for, but the results were good enough.  As to the
destruction of the cannon itself....
</p>

<p>
"Aha.  Look at this, all of you," I called out, pointing.  They
gathered around, studying what I was indicating.  "See here?  This is
one of the cannons that were sewn shut, not Mended into a whole.  We
took the cloth form of the iron while it was Shrunk, took a few
threads from the side, and stitched the edges closed.  When we
un-Shrunk it, the stitching grew with it, holding the whole thing
together.  But the stitching was a weak point; when the explosion went
off, it failed at the seam, not in the barrel itself.  But look at
this one," I moved to the cannon we had sheltered behind, indicating
the lack of a seam.  "With this one, the edge was closed using a
Mending spell.  There's no seams, no weak points to fail.  It'll stand
up to repeated shots and, as long as we don't overcharge it again,
there won't be a problem.  The crew will need to replace the ignition
plug after every shot and feed in more ignition cable, but that's
doable."
</p>

<p>
Duncan spat to one side, clearly unwilling to give up on his dislike
of the idea.  "So what?  The <em>crew</em> is the weak point.
Untrained bastards'll run as soon as the enemy comes in sight."
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, I had this one covered.  Who would have thought that a
taste for military science fiction would have practical applications?
(Oh, and&mdash;thank you, John Ringo and Dave Drake!)
</p>

<p>
"No they won't, Duncan.  Because the leader of each crew is going to
be a regular army soldier with a crossbow and orders to shoot any man
who runs."
</p>

<p>
Duncan raised an eyebrow and eyed me in the same way you would eye a
terrier that had just growled at a mastiff.  Then he sneered at me;
his body language was only a small step less combative than when he
curbstomped me behind the stables.  "You can't stiffen a bucket of
spit with a handful of pebbles, <em>My Lord</em>.  They'll panic and
swarm the officer, or just run in all directions so he can't get'em
all.  As you would know, if you had the slightest military experience,
or even the basic sense to ask advice from the competent people.  You
had <em>one</em> good idea with the bombings, and even there you got
lucky.  As for this half-assed lashup...I've got more years of service
than you've got brain cells and I'm telling you that you just wasted
an entire day of production and reams of magic on this stupid idea.
There is NO WAY to make it work."
</p>

<p>
I bared my teeth in frustration and snapped back at him.  "Duncan, I
now officially declare this to be Your Problem.  Figure out how
to <em>make</em> it work, because we ARE doing it.  Now shut your
mouth and start thinking, because I expect to see the first teams of
cannoneers training by noon tomorrow."
</p>

<p>
He glowered sourly at me but shut up, looking away.  As he turned, I
saw the slightest flicker of a smile, and knew that I'd just been
tested again.  Argh.
</p>

<p>
"Right," I said brightly.  "Let's do some additional shoots with this
second cannon.  We need to figure out how big a charge we can use
without it blowing the hell up."
