<p>
I blinked.
</p>

<p>
"What?!"
</p>

<p>
His eyes drifted down to me, looking positively haunted.  "M'Lord,
you <em>died</em> because of my mistake.  When the Deorsi attacked, I
failed to remove you from the Plaza.  I also failed to place you under
anti-magic protection when the troops and I went in against the Deorsi
infantry.  The infantry were the proximate threat; they had to be
dealt with first, and we were heavily outnumbered so I needed all the
troops in order to stop them from bypassing us.  I knew that the
Deorsi wouldn't call down fire on their own people; every scrap of
information we had supported that, so I judged it safe to leave you
unattended for a few rounds while we dealt with the incoming.  I felt
that we could reduce their numbers and then I and Alpha Squad could
step back to cover you with anti-mage defense and close-in protection
while the rest of the 'Guard went after the magi.  In retrospect,
it's clear that this was a mistake; I should have left someone beside
you with a readied action to provide anti-magic defense as required. I
didn't expect your lightning weapon to drop all of them so quickly,
and when they went down...I critical failed my initiative roll and the
mages got their attacks off before I could move.  I didn't give the
right orders, and you <em>died.</em>"

<p>
I shrugged uneasily, shuddering as the memories of death and
resurrection unspooled through my newly-augmented high-fidelity
memory.  "Thomas, it's ok.  I got better.  It all came out ok."
</p>

<p>
His face twisted, the stoic mask cracking.  "My Lord, <strong>you
died.</strong>  No ruler of Flobovia has been killed in office for
eight hundred years!  I am the <em>first</em> Landguard commander to
fail his principal, <em>ever</em>.  There is no excuse; it was a
plain error in judgement."
</p>

<p>
I wasn't exactly sure what I was feeling, but whatever it was, it was
pretty close to panic.  "Thomas, <em>I'm fine.</em>  Death is cheap
here&mdash;there's so many ways to bring someone back from the dead
it's not even funny.  It's not&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He was shaking his head before I was halfway through, and finally he
cut me off, talking over me.  "No, it's <em>not.</em>  Not for you.
You aren't from this world; the normal rules don't apply to you.
There's no afterlife waiting for you to call you back from; if you
die, you die.  Period."
</p>

<p>
I frowned.  "That's pretty obviously not true, since I'm sitting
here."
</p>

<p>
Thomas was still shaking his head.  Peripherally, I was vaguely aware
that the other Landguard were watching us, stonefaced and immobile,
trying not to draw attention while we had our battle of wills.  I
didn't have the attention to spare to really notice them, though.
</p>

<p>
"My Lord, no," he told me.  "You were <em>not</em> resurrected.  Raise
Dead, Resurrection&mdash;even True Resurrection won't work on you.
Remember how we told you that you had been dead for four hours because
it took that long to get you off the battlefield?  That was a lie; we
had your body off the battlefield and back in the palace within ten
minutes of your demise.  We had the Archpriest there five minutes
later."
</p>

<p>
He paused and took a deep breath as though preparing himself for great
pain.  His voice was wobbly as he continued; he sounded like the words
were being torn out of him.  "The Archpriest spent four hours
communing with the True God, bargaining for your life.  Even the True
God could not bring you back; once dead, you were simply gone, your
soul unrecoverable.  Instead, He bent time, making it so that you
never actually died.  He pulled you off the battlefield in the moment
between when you were hit by the attacks and when you died.  He
transported you to the Work Room and healed your wounds.  It was a
mighty working, even for Him, and He made clear that He would not do
it again.  If I fail you again, there will be no third chance; this is
why I am unfit to serve.  You need someone wiser and more cautious
than I."
</p>

<p>
I blinked and cocked my head a bit, trying to wrap head around that.
My newly enhanced brain considered what I'd just been told, examined
the causality involved and went <em>Tilt!  Does not compute!</em>
</p>

<p>
"But...but...that doesn't make sense," I whimpered.  "If the God
pulled me through time, then my body wasn't there for you to carry
back to the castle, so&mdash;yurgh!"
</p>

<p>
Thomas shrugged; a vague trace of sympathetic humor flickered over the
pain in his eyes and, just for a moment, his mouth twitched into
something vaguely like a smile before dropping back into misery.  
</p>

<p>
"I and the other Landguard survivors remember&mdash;and lived
through&mdash;both timelines.  Both paths actually happened, but when
they merged back together this is the timeline we were left with.
Thankfully."  There was indeed a lot of thanks in his voice as he said
that.
</p>

<p>
I thought about it for another few seconds, trying to make sense of
the idea that causality could be tied into a four-dimensional pretzel,
and what the resulting chain of events must have looked like.  When I
felt my eyes crossing I pushed it away and focused on the important
issue: talking Thomas out of his resignation.
</p>

<p>
"Well, however unorthodox it might have been, the fact remains: I'm
not dead.  So I don't see how you failed your duty.  I'm still here,
so clearly you didn't fail to protect me."
</p>

<p>
His expression turned outright mulish; clearly, he was determined not
to be swayed away from his belief in his own failure.  "The fact
remains, My Lord: you died.  It is my job to keep you alive, and I
failed.  I am the first Landguard <em>ever</em> to fail in my duty and
I have dishonored myself and shamed the tradition of the 'Guard.  It
has been a pleasure to serve you, My Lord.  May your reign be long and
successful."  His mouth twitched slightly again, the vaguest hint of a
smile.  "If only because if you <em>don't</em> have a long reign, it
means we lost the war."
</p>

<p>
Another time, another conversation, and that might actually have been
funny.
</p>

<p>
Thomas saluted me, bowed, and turned on his heel for the door.
</p>

<p>
"Alpha Squad, stop that man," I said, speaking to the air
distractedly.  The whole room seemed to lurch as everyone looked at
me, startled.  Robert and the others looked at me, looked at Thomas,
and slowly moved to block his way. They looked horribly embarrassed,
and nodded to Thomas apologetically as they stepped in his path.
</p>

<p>
<em>~Figure it out, brain!~</em> I yelled into the cavern of my skull.
An echoing silence came back; I was simply too stunned by the
situation to have much brainpower online.
</p>

<p>
Grimly, I forced my newly enhanced brain to lock onto the problem,
pushing aside the surprise, confusion, and outright horror.  I would
deal with all that later; right now, I needed to figure this out.  I
rested my chin on my tented fingers and closed my eyes, forcing myself
to run down every possibility branch, looking to see where there might
be a path to victory.
</p>

<p>
"Jake, you can't do this," Thomas said, simultaneously resigned and
irritated.
</p>

<p>
I didn't even look up.  "Hello, absolute dictator here?  I bloody well
can do this.  Now be quiet for a minute.  That's an order."  Thomas's
face went red from rage and promises of death flashed from his eyes,
but he obeyed, folding his arms and tapping his foot impatiently.
</p>

<p>
<em>~I need to convince him not to go.  How?~</em> I threw together a
thought forest, each node in the forest being the root of a tree
charting all the opening statements I could make, the probable
responses to it, my responses to that.  Rapidly, I started pruning the
forest.
</p>

<p>
<em>~I order you not to resign.~</em> Fail; he would say that he had
failed me, dishonored himself, and it was not in my best interest for
him to continue to serve.
</p>

<p>
<em>~It's not in the best interest of the Land for the most
experienced Landguard to resign.~</em> Fail.  He would go off and join
one of the Special Units, which would satisfy his need for service
while removing him from my vicinity.
</p>

<p>
<em>~You're being a coward and running away from your duty.~</em>
Fail.  A direct attack would only make him dig in his heels further.
He was already wallowing in self-doubt and self-flagellation, heaping
more fuel on the fire wouldn't help.
</p>

<p>
<em>~You didn't fail, because I'm still alive.~</em> Fail.  He
remembered me being dead, therefore in his mind he had failed.
</p>

<p>
Oh.  There it was.
</p>

<p>
"Thomas, sit down and listen to me," I instructed firmly, pointing at
the chair opposite me.
</p>

<p>
"Jake, let the poor guy go," Allison said from the fireplace.  For
once, she wasn't her usual acerbic self; her tone was pure sadness.
"Don't make it worse than it already is."
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.  "Sit down, Thomas.  I'll make you a deal: you listen
to me for three minutes and seriously consider what I have to say.  If
at the end of that you still want to go, you can, with my blessings."
</p>

<p>
Unwillingly, he took a seat and sat, stiffly, lips pressed together in
an impatient scowl.
</p>

<p>
I took a deep breath and leaned forward.  I was rolling the dice big
time here; any good trial lawyer will tell you never to ask a question
you don't know the answer to.  I was betting a lot on a few guesses
and some twisty logic that I would need to persuade Thomas to accept.
</p>

<p>
"Assume the Deorsi had never attacked and everything was fine.  As the
Command of the Landguard, would your oath allow you to resign your
post in time of war?"  I stared at him intently, praying that my
guesses were correct.
</p>

<p>
His response made clear his irritation and impatience. "What does that
have to do with anything?  I've made up my mind, Jake, let it go."
</p>

<p>
"Answer the question.  Would your oath allow you to resign in time of
war?"
</p>

<p>
"No, of course not.  Our duty is to protect the ruler, resigning would
be to forsake that duty. But that's not relevant; I failed in my duty
and proved myself unfit.  My bad judgement clearly makes me a danger
to you in a command role; it is my duty to remove myself."
</p>

<p>
I held on to the beginning of that speech and discarded the rest.  A
faint ray of hope spread through me.  "Ok, so your duty would not
allow you to resign if nothing had gone wrong, but since it did it is
now your duty <em>to</em> resign.  Fine.  Why didn't you resign when
that ninja rat attacked me in the hallway and killed me?"
</p>

<p>
He blinked, his face screwing up in angry bafflement at what seemed
like mockery.  "What are you talking about?  No ninja rat attacked
you."
</p>

<p>
I affected surprise.  "Hold on, you don't remember that ninja rat
attacking and killing me?  Why didn't you resign then?"
</p>

<p>
"Because it didn't happen!  Stop screwing around, Jake.  I'm done with
this."  He rose to his feet, intending to stride out of the room, but
paused when I jumped in.
</p>

<p>
"So your duty wouldn't allow you to resign over something that never
happened?"  This was the key point; I needed him to acknowledge it.  I
was leaning forward, trying to will the words out of him the way an
audience raises a leg to will the highjumper over the bar.
</p>

<p>
"Godsdam&mdash;True God damnit Jake, stop mocking me!  This isn't
funny."  He face was bright red and he was literally shaking.  A less
disciplined man might well have slugged me already.
</p>

<p>
"Answer the question, Thomas!  Would your duty allow you to resign
over something that didn't happen?"
</p>

<p>
"Obviously not!  Stop being stupid, you prat!"
</p>

<p>
My breath whooshed out in relief as the trap closed.  I leaned back,
smiling.  "In that case, why do you feel you have the right to resign
now?"  I paused, watching his face. He was starting to look confused
as well as angry, which was exactly what I needed.  "You said it
yourself, Thomas.  <em>The God unmade that timeline.</em>  He snatched
me across time and space in the split second before I died and healed
me.  <em>I never actually died in this timeline.</em> It never
happened.  You may remember it, but those are false memories; they
don't reflect the current state of history.  If your duty won't allow
you to resign over something that didn't happen, then you can't resign
over my 'death'...because I didn't die."
</p>

<p>
He started to retort and then froze, mouth open, as his thoughts
shifted gears without a clutch.
</p>

<p>
After a moment he collapsed back into his chair, looking completely
poleaxed.  "But...it did happen.  You died.  I carried your body to
the castle myself.  You were burned; I remember bits of you breaking
off, even though I carried you as gently as I could."
</p>

<p>
I shuddered, pushing the images away.  My newly enhanced memory and
imagination suddenly began to seem like far more of a curse than a
blessing; I knew I'd be seeing that image again at random moments for
a long time.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and thank you for that charming picture.  Whatever you think you
remember, it's a lie.  That isn't the way history really is.  It's
like some magic spell planted false memories in your head."  Thomas
flashed a glance at me, eyes wide, and then his expression vanished
into his usual blank professional mask.  "Whatever you think you
remember, that's simply not what happened.  What actually happened is
that I was hit by a fireball and then instantly teleported to the Work
Room and healed.  I never <em>actually</em> died, not even for a
moment.  As such, you never failed your duty and you have no right to
resign."
</p>

<p>
You could have heard a pin drop.
</p>

<p>
"But...but you were hit by the fireball.  You <em>would</em> have
died, except for divine intervention.  And it's my fault that you were
hit."  The tone was confused, sad, maybe a bit frightened, but I heard
a tiny flicker of hope in there somewhere.
</p>

<p>
I grabbed onto that flicker and tried to fan it into a flame.
"Whether your decisions were optimal or not, they were clearly good
enough because I didn't die.  Yes, there is a possible world in which
I died.  And in that possible world you convinced the Archpriest to
bring me back, which destroyed that possible world.  The world where I
died never happened; we don't live there, and history doesn't look
like that.  Whether you saved me on the battlefield, or saved me by
convincing the Archpriest to rewrite time, the fact is that you made
the decision that saved me.  You did your duty, you protected my life,
and you have no right to give up and abandon your post."
</p>

<p>
Allison's voice was gentle.  "He's right, Thomas.  You didn't fail.
And even if you believe you did, he needs you.  He needs your advice
even more than your physical protection; you're the only member of the
Landguard with the political and strategic skill to advise him.
Duncan's a hell of a fighter, a great trainer, and a great tactician,
but he's no strategist.  No offense, Duncan," she added hurriedly.
</p>

<p>
Duncan grunted, amused.  "Only a damn fool gets offended by the simple
truth, girl."  His leathery face twisted into a wry grin for a moment
and he snorted, shaking his head in bemusement.  "The boy's got you,
lad.  Whatever you think, you didn't actually fail your duty.  And
even if you did, leaving would be a bigger failure than staying.  The
boy needs your support on the Conclave; he's already pissed off the
Duke and the Archpriest, Isaac is a snooty, easily-offended bastard,
and Lady Shadow always wants a weak ruler because it makes for more
criminal opportunity.  Lady Justice likewise&mdash;she doesn't want
rulers coming along and changing all the laws around, making her
scramble to reorganize her corps.  If you leave and appoint me
Commander that means I'm stuck on the hot seat.  How do you think I'd
handle those bastards?  My idea of a decisive argument involves
kicking someone in the balls and shoving a sword through his face.
They'd eat me alive."
</p>

<p>
Thomas just sat there, his mouth opening and closing like a goldfish.
"But..but I can't do the job.  I resigned in front of all of you; it
would weaken my command authority."  The argument was half-hearted;
clearly, he wanted to be proven wrong.
</p>

<p>
Sensing victory, I whipped around to face the others.  "This is a
direct order: you will never, under any circumstances, reveal the fact
that Thomas attempted to resign.  Not to anyone.  Not your priest, not
your girlfriend, not your mother.  No one.  Do not discuss it amongst
yourselves, do not even think about it.  As far as you're concerned,
it never happened.  Because if the word got out, then Thomas would
lose his ability to be an effective Commander.  And without Thomas as
an effective Commander, I can't be as effective a ruler.  And if I
can't be effective as a ruler, we'll probably lose the war and all the
people of the Land will be killed or drafted to go fight undead.  So
talking about it would be not just a breach of a direct order from
your ruler, but also counter to your duty to the Land.  Got it?"  I
waited for them all to nod, then turned back to Thomas, a wicked grin
on my face.
</p>

<p>
"Next?" I asked archly.  I had the win and we all knew it.  The sweet,
sweet tang of victory was in my mouth and I wasn't letting it get
away.
</p>

<p>
Thomas slumped bonelessly in his chair, his forearms hanging limply
over the armrests.  He just stared at me for a long minute.
</p>

<p>
Finally his expression firmed up and he rose smoothly to his feet,
snapping off a parade-ground salute to me.  "Thomas Rheinhart,
Commander of the Landguard, sixty first High Defender of Ruler And
Land, reporting for duty My Lord!  How may I serve?"
</p>

<p>
I blew out a breath I hadn't realized I was holding and sagged in my
seat with relief.
</p>
