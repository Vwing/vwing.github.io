<p>
There were two reasons why Colborn had risen so high in the service of
Lich King Hammond.  First, Colborn was a clever, vicious, and
terrifically powerful battlemage who could stomp most opponents like
an empty beer can.  More importantly, Colborn and Hammond had similar
outlooks on life: simple, straightforward, pragmatic.  Neither one
saw a need to indulge in complicated scheming very often, since most
problems could be solved by shooting them in the face.
</p>

<p>
Hammond's considerable power had allowed him to become a lich, and to
ascend through the loosely-defined ranks of his kind until he attained
the title of Lich King.  The rest of the world acknowledged his might;
he was treated with respect everywhere, his demense was recognized and
respected by even the most powerful members of the Underdark
community, and merchants were careful to grovel and offer steep
discounts when they sold him the magical texts and research supplies
that were his primary expenses.
</p>

<p>
His straightforwardness, however, had pinned Hammond firmly to the
bottom echelon of the Lich Kings.  He walked softly around the others,
acknowledging (at least in private) that most of them could beat him
if they wanted to make the effort.  He was especially careful with
Afi, who Hammond knew full well could crush him like a bug should the
ancient lich so desire.
</p>

<p>
Hammond's defenses were characteristic of his personality;
straightforward, but very thorough.  Unlike his more conniving
brethren, Hammond's lair was not mobile; he had found a cavern system
in the Underdark and filled it with traps and guardians. The place was
packed to the metaphorical rafters with construct creatures, undead,
Explosive Runes, Symbols of Death, and spell traps of every kind from
"kill you a lot" to "kill you a <em>whole lot</em>, then banish your
ashes to the Negative Energy Plane."  
</p>

<p>
At the center of the complex was a mausoleum containing a sarcophagus
in which Hammond stored a few preserved reminders of his life before
unlife...mostly a few of the many strips of skin he'd had to tear from
his living body in order to become a lich.  More importantly however,
the mausoleum was the entryway to the extradimensional space in which
Hammond actually lived.
</p>

<p>
Colborn walked calmly through the outer defenses; many of the
guardians recognized him by sight or scent, and stepped aside when he
approached.  Others required a password.  Traps needed to be bypassed
in elaborate ways&mdash;the possession of a particular amulet, a
statement of identity while within a Zone of Truth, the knowledge of
exactly which pattern of flagstones to step on in what order to
prevent the entire room from being flooded with
magma...straightforward, but thorough.
</p>

<p>
Once into the mausoleum, Colborn waited patiently until the wizard
currently manning the scrying pool in the extradimensional space
identified him and opened the gate.  The vampire mage stepped through,
ignoring the bowing and scraping of the scrying mage.
</p>

<p>
Onwards he strode, looking neither left nor right, treading the safe
path with the ease of long familiarity.  Guardian horrors skittered
rapidly out of his path.  Doors opened promptly as he approached.
Traps temporarily deactivated themselves to allow him to pass.
</p>

<p>
Finally, after traversing an impressive amount of corridors, Colborn
arrived in the audience chamber.
</p>

<p>
The room was enormous, designed to impress.  The walls were invisible
in the darkness, and a single Continual Flame on a pillar thirty feet
from the entrance provided the only illumination.  It was just enough
to show the raised dias and throne before it, and the lines of columns
radiating off into the darkness.  Anyone waiting in the light would,
from the corner of their eye, catch hints of squirming movement out in
the darkness.  The slow, ominous dripping of water was the only
sound...although it was occasionally broken by a faint cackling from
no identifiable direction.
</p>

<p>
Colborn ignored all of that and waited patiently, respectfully down on
one knee before the dais.  Eventually, Hammond's ghostly presence
seeped into existence on the throne in front of him.
</p>

<p>
"How went your mission, My Hand?" hissed the lich.
</p>

<p>
Colborn looked up to meet his (secretly former) master's empty gaze.
Colborn smiled in triumph, baring sharp fangs.  "Highly successful,
Master.  I found the human renegades right where we expected.
Unfortunately, I had to kill their leader, but I managed to capture
and interrogate three of his subordinates.  The more important part,
though, is the spellbooks that I found.  They contain literally
thousands of spells, many of which I have not seen before.  I have
them here in my Portable Hole if you would like to see them...?"  All
of that was true; one did not lie in the presence of a Lich King and
expect to get away with it.  The story simply left out certain key
facts such as that, after interrogating and killing the band of wild
humans, Colborn had been captured, had his alignment forcibly changed,
and was now here with the express intent of betraying the Lich King to
whom he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"So thoughtful of you, My Hand," the lich hissed in its dead,
paper-dry voice.  "Please, bring the books to my laboratory."  A
grinding sound came from the darkness as the massive stone door to the
inner labyrinth swung slowly open.
</p>

<p>
Colborn bowed politely, rose, and passed through the door into the
labyrinth that was the first layer of Hammond's true defenses.  Sixty
feet into the labyrinth he yanked a folded-up Portable Hole from his
pocket and slapped it on the wall.
</p>

<p>
"<em>GO!</em>" he bellowed, immediately drawing on his vampiric powers
to transform into a cloud of mist.  The cloud bolted for the exit at
maximum speed; Colborn's part in the plan was done, and all that
remained was to escape as quickly as possible before all hell rained
down on him.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Facts are a curious thing.  Without context, they are generally
meaningless, yet when you pile enough of them together, a picture
tends to emerge.  As an example, consider the following collection of
not-so-random facts:
</p>

<p>
Hammond, being no fool, had fashioned wall niches around the entrance
to his labyrinth.
</p>

<p>
Iron golems are physically powerful constructs made (unsurprisingly)
out of iron.  They are twelve feet tall, immune to magic, and one of
the best counters to hostile magi.  They are also very good at
squishing pointy-stick types, making them one of the guards of choice
for powerful beings such as, just for a random example, the Lich King
Hammond.
</p>

<p>
All twelve of the iron golems in the niches around the door to the
labyrinth had been given the order "if anyone comes through that door
and does anything other than walk slowly and calmly in that direction,
kill them."
</p>

<p>
Slapping a Portable Hole on the wall is not the same as "walk slowly
and calmly in that direction."  This might relate to why Colborn was
currently fleeing for his unlife.
</p>

<p>
Grappling is the art of grabbing onto another human being, usually but
not necessarily with the intent to immobilize or harm them.
</p>

<p>
The grappling rules of Dungeons and Dragons are
infamous&mdash;nay, <em>legendary</em>&mdash;for their complexity and
incomprehensibility.  When ancient texts of madness and evil gather
for cocktails, even the fabled Necronomicon bows before the superior
might of the grappling rules. Many brave DMs and players have been
reduced to rocking in a corner whispering "The horror!  The horror!"
after delving into the grappling rules.
</p>

<p>
Despite the complexity, there are only four things about the grappling
rules that are really important.  First, when you grapple someone,
both of you are in the same 5'x5' square.  Second, by carefully
exploiting the letter of the rules it is possible for thirty five
hundred people (just to choose a random number) to grapple each other,
thereby putting thirty five hundred people in one 5'x5' square.
</p>

<p>
(As an aside, thirty five hundred adult humans (well,
human<em>oids</em>; there were some elves, halflings, and so on) in
one 5'x5' square would have a density roughly twice that of osmium,
the densest metal on Earth.  On Earth, this would mean "all of those
people become undifferentiated meat paste."  On Stupidworld, it means
"oh look, it's Tuesday.")
</p>

<p>
The third important thing about the grappling rules is that there is a
very limited set of actions that someone in a grapple may perform.
Two of those are 'activate a magic item' and 'attack with a light
weapon such as a dagger.'  Oddly, these actions can be performed even
while buried at the very center of what should be a giant ball of meat
paste.
</p>

<p>
The fourth and and most important thing about the grappling rules is
that any member of a grapple can move at half their speed, dragging
all members of the grapple along.  An average human can therefore move
fifteen feet per six-second round while grappling, towing an infinite
number of people with them.  The Landguard, living under permanent
Haste spells, can move thirty feet every round while, again, towing an
infinite number of people with them.
</p>

<p>
Two thousand normal casters and fifteen hundred Landguard, taking
turns moving at half their movement speed and dragging everyone else
along, can move 75,000 feet every six seconds, which is roughly Mach
11, which is roughly one third of the escape velocity of the Earth.
</p>

<p>
At Mach 11 even the most complex labyrinth can be explored very
quickly.  Even when that labyrinth sprawls out across a dozen linear
miles of tunnels, interconnected in strange ways by secret doors and
disguised Teleportation Circles.
</p>

<p>
The 'put your left hand on the wall' method that the supposedly
brilliant and equipped-with-otherworldy-knowledge Emperor Jake had
suggested is a complete failure for most realistic mazes. Fortunately,
several of the two thousand highly intelligent magi who formed the
MeatBall O'Doom (as Jake had christened it) were fans of chess,
crossword puzzles, and abstruse math.  As a result, they knew
the <em>correct</em> algorithm for navigating a maze, which consists
of painting lines on the floor every time you traverse a corridor and
looking to see which corridors you have only traversed once.
</p>

<p>
Thirty five hundred people can carry a <em>lot</em> of paint.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
"<em>GO!</em>" Colborn bellowed, immediately drawing on his vampiric
powers to transform into a cloud of mist.  The cloud bolted for the
exit at maximum speed; Colborn's part in the plan was done, and all
that remained was to escape as quickly as possible before all hell
rained down on him.
</p>

<p>
Behind him, <em>something</em> erupted from the Portable Hole.  Had
there been an observer standing nearby she would have been unable to
identify the thing before it vanished at hypersonic speed down the
corridor, trailing a series of sonic booms behind it.  Only if the
theoretical observer had been under the effects of a Time Stop would
she have had the subjective time for her eyes to focus on what could
then be recognized as a group of thirty five hundred people grabbing
onto each other, all of them packed into a region five feet on a side.
</p>

<p>
Traversing the tunnels took essentially no time. Dealing with the
various guardians took even less time; upon encountering a threat, the
MeatBall O'Doom would simply run right over it and a few dozen
Landguard would stab it to death with their heavily enchanted
adamantine daggers on the way by.  Very few things are able to react
in time to strike at a hyperdense ball of meat moving at Mach 11.
Those creatures that did manage to attack before being overrun hit
only the outermost layer, composed entirely of heavily protected
Landguard.  The only injury inflicted by the myriad of Hammond's
guardians was to Justin Wineholt, a 'tadpole' who had joined at the
last intake. Poor Justin was unfortunate enough to be bitten in the
buttock by some nightmare that consisted mostly of gibbering mouths
with far too many teeth.  His Lay On Hands ability promptly erased the
injury, but for the rest of his time in the Landguard (i.e., the rest
of his life) he would be known as "One Cheek Wineholt."
</p>

<p>
Of course, the physical guardians were almost an afterthought; the
true defenses of the labyrinth were magical.  The MeatBall O'Doom
passed over hundreds of traps that fired damaging spells, thousands of
Explosive Runes, enough Symbols of Death to depopulate a small city,
and spells of guard and ward and alarm beyond counting.
</p>

<p>
None of it mattered.  Guardian Fourth Harold Farmer was currently five
layers in from the surface of the MeatBall, on what had been the
southeast side when it was formed.  Immediately upon emerging from the
Portable Hole he had triggered the mage defense power of his Landguard
blades, wrapping the entire group in an antimagic field that rendered
them utterly immune to spells of any sort.  (It also removed the
Landguard's magical Haste, but all that did was slow the Meatball
O'Doom down from Mach 11 to about Mach 8.) All of the decades that the
mighty Lich King Hammond had invested in building protections for his
lair were rendered irrelevant by one seventeen year old paladin who,
until the day before, had been only fifth level.
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
Even a lich as straightforward as Hammond is rarely surprised.
Casters of legendary power and cunning (yes, even Hammond;
'straightforward' does not imply a lack of cunning), liches have
carefully layered defenses and alarms second only to those of the
Batman.  Given this, it is not at all unreasonable that when the
MeatBall came through his door at hypersonic velocity, Hammond was
more surprised at being surprised than he was at the surprise itself.
</p>

<p>
Instead of standing armed and battleready, Hammond was seated at his
pipe organ, working on his latest composition.  The composition was a
beautiful piece, full of sonorous tones that murmured of the joys and
trauma of eternal unlife, the beauty and horror&mdash;and yes,
loneliness&mdash;that one inevitably encountered as the centuries
rolled by.  Lost in his music, it was unsurprising just <em>how</em>
surprised Hammond was when an utterly unreasonable number of enemy
casters and warriors burst through his door
</p>

<p>
It should be considered entirely fair that a squawk of astonished
dismay burst from his bony jaws when the MeatBall O'Doom blazed into
his cavernous sanctum sanctorum, ran completely over him and erupted
into a regiment of attackers.  Caught flatfooted in the surprise
round, Hammond was hit with twenty five hundred Mage's Disjunction
spells (carefully placed and sequenced so as not to hit friendlies).
The barrage destroyed his entire arsenal of magic items and protective
spells.  Immediately after his defenses were stripped away, he was
nearly buried under several dozen fenfrogs, who promptly sucked the
spellcasting abilities right out of him.  His abilities would return
in a few days, but he had no way of knowing that. For the first time
in his long unlife, he stood frozen in speechless horror as he faced a
future reduced to nothing more than a skeletal commoner.
</p>

<p>
Their target disabled, a dedicated platoon of Landguard who carried no
magic items raced forward to collect the 'frogs and stuff them back
into their carry bags so that they couldn't attack any of the
Gr&#491;fhamrites.  In the process of collection, the 'frogs sucked
the spellcasting abilities out of those Landguard; those worthies
considered a week of not being able to cast spells a perfectly
acceptable sacrifice for capturing a lich.
</p>

<p>
With the dangerous magic-eating amphibians removed, the remaining
Landguard descended on Hammond and beat him unconscious with the hilts
of their blades.
</p>

<p>
"Put the Helm on him," Duncan growled.

<em><strong>Note for D&D pedants:</strong></em>
</p>

<p>
<em>I've had a fair number of comments that it's not possible for
several hundred people to grapple together.  Happily for the sake of
the story, it can be done.  The relevant rules for grappling are:</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>
<ul>
  <li>
	Several combatants can be in a single grapple. 
  </li>

  <li>
	Up to four combatants can grapple a single opponent in a given
	round.
  </li>
  </ul>
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Note the distinction here.  'Several' (i.e., a number that is
unspecified and therefore can be arbitrarily large) can be in a
grapple, but only four can grapple a particular target.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>
If Charlie grapples Bob, then both of them are grappling each other
and each is in a grapple with one opponent.  Bob then grapples Al
(thereby joining the grapple); Charlie is grappling one opponent
(Bob), Bob is grappling two (Charlie and Al), and Al is grappling one
(Bob).  There are three people in the grapple, but none of them are
grappling more than two people.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>
More generally: Person 0 grapples persons 1, 2, 3. Person 1 (who is
already grappling with person 0) now grapples persons 4, 5, 6. Next,
person 2 (who is already grappling with person 0) grapples persons
7,8,9.  Note that everyone is involved in one grapple, but no one is
grappling more than four people.  It's a series of interlocking
groups, much like a giant molecule made of atoms that are sharing
electrons.  Because after all, writing a D&D fanfic isn't sufficiently
nerdy unless you can throw in some basic atomic physics on top!
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Now, there's a second objection that a suitable pedantic pedant
might make: "Ah, but the rules say that if you cannot enter your
target's square then the grapple fails, and clearly there isn't enough
room in one square for thirty five hundred people."  Hogwash.  By RAW
there isn't enough room in one square for five Medium creatures in the
first place.  Clearly, the grappling rules provide an exception to
this objection, and that 'cannot enter' sentence refers to something
like "if there are bars in the way so you can grab the person through
the bars but not move through them to close."  Ergo, you can have as
many people in the grapple as you want.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>The lesson that you should take from all this, of course, is that
I should <strong>never, ever again</strong> demonstrate an exploit
that requires this much explanation.  I should have known better than
to dip into the grappling rules for they are a source of madness and
confusion and evil to which even the fabled Necronomicon pays
homage.</em>

<p>
"In a society without death, Ingfred is 20 years old and has no

undergo an illegal transformation and sell the memory to The
Experiental Herald for a ridiculous sum.

There's two problems: how can Ingfred convince a powerful wizard to
