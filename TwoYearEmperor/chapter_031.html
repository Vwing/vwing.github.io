<em><strong>Author's Note</strong>: I am still with the non-ownage of
D&D.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Also, a lot of people have PM'd me to ask how Albrecht knew the "I
am become Death, Destroyer of Worlds" quote that he used last chapter.
In order to save some epileptic trees I will answer that: Jake used
the quote at the end of Chapter 27, after they watched the antimatter
bomb go off.  Albrecht got the sense of it and quoted it back to make
a point.</em>
</p>

<p>
Thomas looked thoughtfully at the tens of thousands of trees that the
Deorsi had just effortlessly destroyed.  When he looked back at
Albrecht, it was like watching gun turrets swivel to their target.
"Your weapon clearly can't affect us while we're under our Antimagic
Fields.  You claim that this Disjunction of yours can take the field
down...if so, it must be pretty high level.  And there aren't enough
of you to supply a 'large number' of high level spells.  Especially
since most of your people"&mdash;a head toss towards Kadja and the
others&mdash;"are warriors, not casters."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht smiled again.  "Well, yes.  Now, please don't be startled;
remember that I have no intention of trying to harm you or anyone
else."  He paused a minute, clearly hoping for an acknowledgement, but
Thomas gave him nothing.  With a shrug Albrecht called out "Second
Company, all elements: drop cloak."
</p>

<p>
With a command like that, I think I can be forgiven for expecting a
half dozen Warbirds to shimmer into existence off the port bow.
Sadly, there was no shimmer.  One moment the sky to our left was
empty, the next four giant Persian carpets hovered there, each packed
with men and women in wizard robes.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht looked over his shoulder at Second Company, then looked back
at Thomas with an apologetic shrug.  "There's an old saying in the
Anundj&aring;n War College: Enemies don't kill people, insufficient
preparation kills people. Given how things are, I'm afraid it gets to
be a bit of a habit after a few decades."
</p>

<p>
Thomas considered Albrecht for a moment, then sheathed his swords and
reached a hand down to him.  Albrecht took the hand and allowed
himself to be pulled to his feet.  Thomas made a hand gesture and the
other Landguard sheathed their swords as well.
</p>

<p>
"You're absolutely right, High Marshal.  As it happens, the Landguard
have a similar saying: Proactive Paranoia Provides Proper Protection.
As an example: Stone Badgers, warning shot please."  A massive stroke
of lightning erupted from somewhere to our right and lanced overhead,
the thunderclap leaving my ears ringing.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht looked around, but there were no visible Flobovian wizards
nearby.
</p>

<p>
"Third Cannoneers, deploy," Thomas called in a ringing voice.  A
hundred yards away, twelve men flipped back the camoflage netting that
had been concealing them and stood up.  Two men in each of the four
teams hoisted the netting upright, pinning the bottom in place with a
foot on each corner.  The third man of each team pulled a circle of
black cloth off the ground and slapped it against the netting.  The
circles stuck in place and, suddenly, a ten foot deep tunnel lead into
each net.
</p>

<p>
Four teams of cannoneers rolled their weapons out from inside the
tunnels, generators already connected and spinning.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not sure if you've seen these 'cannon' that M'Lord introduced,"
Thomas offered with a butter-wouldn't-melt-in-my-mouth tone.  "At
first I wasn't too sure about their suitability, but I must say that
the tests have been quite impressive.  Heavy damage, long range, quite
an area of effect. You know, if those cannon were to fire for any
reason&mdash;such as, oh, because Jake had been killed&mdash;I'm
pretty confident that everyone in this encampment would die.
Messily."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht eyed the cannon for a moment, then eyed Thomas.  One eyebrow
rose.  "And if I said that all of us were carrying Protection from
Arrows spells and were therefore immune to projectile weapons...?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas smiled, with teeth.  "Then I would say it's a good thing that I
brought a large number of Flobovia's newest military unit.
Countermage Company, First Platoon!  On your feet!"
</p>

<p>
In the field behind us, twenty people jumped up from the grass.  A
couple of them were clearly career military, and salty ones at that.
The rest were what looked like a completely random selection of
civilians.  Some of them were probably blacksmiths, entertainers,
butchers, or bakers (although no one looked likely to be a candlestick
maker).  They were men and women, teenagers and grandparents.  The
only thing that they all had in common was the scroll in their hands
and the large sack on each hip from which protruded dozens more
scrolls.
</p>

<p>
"It turns out," Thomas offered.  "That if you mobilize the entire
magical population of a large city to produce Dispel Magic
scrolls...well, you can make a lot of them, very quickly.  Especially
if you have senior mages scribe the spell into their apprentices'
spellbooks so that the apprentices can scribe it as well.  And, of
course, a city of a million people has a lot of citizens with the Use
Magic Device skill who can read those scrolls...a lot more than are
currently standing up, in fact.  How many of your Protection from
Arrows spells do you think would survive when more than thirty
separate Dispel Magic spells landed on every Anundj&aring;n at this
parley...each round?"
</p>

</p>
Albrecht didn't say a word.  He just glared at Thomas as though he
were trying to bore a hole in Thomas's skull with the intensity of his
gaze. Albrecht's face twitched in a way that I couldn't quite
understand; was it rage, for upstaging him?  Contempt, because he
didn't understand the cannon&mdash;or, worse, because he understood
them too well and knew they didn't work?
</p>

<p>
Albrecht's face twitched again and then he totally lost
it."Bwahahahahaha!" He laughed so hard it doubled him over and left
him clutching his stomach.  The peals of laughter went on for long
enough that he was gasping for breath before he finally managed to get
himself under control.  Standing up and wiping the laughter-tears from
his eyes, he clapped Thomas on the shoulder (he had to reach up to do
it).  "I like it, Commander!  Well played, well played!  I think this
is going to be the start of some brilliant teamwork.  Come on, I
brought some good whiskey, let's celebrate!"
