<em>In more important news: if you read this chapter and enjoy it, you

good.</em>

<p>
When Thomas saw that I was intent on leaving the castle, he slammed on
the brakes&mdash;by which I mean he grabbed my collar, pulled me into
a side room and forcibly sat me down while sending Franklin for
backup.  It was just as well; it gave me some time to ask relevant
questions that I had been too excited to think of, review the
Brainopedia a bit, and have Suze run off to find some information
about where we were going.
</p>

<p>
When we walked outside half an hour later there was what looked at
first like an army of newly-resurrected Landguard waiting for us, but
a quick count showed it to be only thirty one.  My protective detail
walked me straight into the middle of them.  I started having
flashbacks to high school, being the twiggy nerd that suddenly found
himself surrounded by all the football jocks.
</p>

<p>
I frowned for a moment; that had been an odd thought.  Before I could
chase the oddity down, however, Thomas was crisply barking out orders.
</p>

<p>
"Sergeant Baker, mage suppression, arrow guard, and
extraction. Sergeant Greenlake, you're still Alpha.  Sergeants
Carpenter, Wood, and Johnson&mdash;" there followed a lot of very
involved conversation in Bodyguard, a little-known secret language
that I do not speak.  There was something about "long range, beer and
pour her", but I'm almost positive that's not actually what he said.
Common sense told me it had to have been "clear and secure" but that's
really not what I heard.
</p>

<p>
Pretty soon I was wrapped up in four layers of security ranging out in
concentric circles for nearly sixty feet.  I'm sure each layer had its
own purpose for existence and that all of those reasons related to
somehow keeping my precious skin intact and unbruised.  Don't get me
wrong, I was absolutely fine with that goal, fully in support of
it&mdash;one might even go so far as to say "seriously enthused by
it."  It still seemed like more than a bit of overkill.  It was rather
like having all of Delta Force escort the head of the high school
Dungeons and Dragons club to homecoming.
</p>

<p>
I shook my head like a fly had landed on me.  <em>~Again, something
odd about that last thought, what was it?~</em> Before I could really
nail it down, we were moving, and I lost track of it.
</p>

<p>
The first few feet were the hardest, as we all sorted out our
placements.  Suze was just to my left, looking scared by all the
surrounding muscle.  Thomas was to my right, so close we occasionally
bumped shoulders.  Duncan was just on the other side of Suze, with the
various layers of guards ranging outwards.
</p>

<p>
I'm pretty sure there have been entire military campaigns that did not
require this much organization.  Nonetheless, we started moving
quickly and&mdash;I have no idea how&mdash;managed to clear the main
gate of the castle without anyone getting tangled up in their own feet
or seriously losing their place in the formation.  I guess the
Landguard really were just that good.
</p>

<p>
As we moved through the city, I was a little creeped out by the fact
that the streets were totally deserted.  No windows were open, there
were no shoppers, homeless, or beggars visible...it was like passing
through a ghost town.
</p>

<p>
Thomas saw me looking around and he tossed his head, pointing forward
with his chin.  "Lead units are evacuating the streets we'll be
passing through, as well as all adjacent streets, and requiring all
windows be closed.  I am not risking your life again."  He was back to
that "like the Terminator, but less cuddly" tone that I remembered
from our long-ago conversation upon my arrival.
</p>

<p>
There really wasn't much to say to that, so I just nodded and kept
walking.
</p>

<p>
<center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later, we arrived at our destination without ever seeing
a living soul.  For a place that contained infinite cosmic power
capable of making me effectively a god, it didn't look like much.
</p>

<p>
The building was wood, and small.  Despite that, it was neatly kept,
with elegantly beautiful carvings on each side of the entryway.  Each
one was a different natural scene: to the left, a river cut through
mountains; to the right, a road lead through a wild meadow; above the
door itself, a narrow path wound its way into a forest.  The detail
was exquisite; I could make out a butterfly over the river, a
gooseberry bush in the meadow, and even a city kid like me could tell
that the forest was birch and maple.
</p>

<p>
At the door was an elderly man in a colored robe.  Were I a woman, and
therefore able to see in 32-bit color, I would probably have said that
the robe was 'sea-foam' or something like that.  Being as my XY
chromosomes only support 4-bit color vision, the robe was 'green.'
(Protip for you ladies: if you're shopping with your boyfriend and you
ask him "which do you like better, the periwinkle or the
lavender?"...no matter what his answer, he's totally guessing.  Also,
speaking from personal experience, he's probably about ready to gnaw
his arm off rather than do more clothes shopping, so the fact that
he's there indicates that he truly loves you from the deepest wells of
his soul.  Just sayin'.)
</p>

<p>
As we walked up, Suze whispered in my ear: "Holy Brother Jason, son of
William.  His father and grandfather were both Holy Brothers."
</p>

<p>
"How may the temple of Ilara serve you this day, Your Lordship?" the
old man inquired with a polite, if shallow, bow.  He seemed honestly
interested and, miracle of miracles, not offended by the Landguard
presence.  I had expected to have to do a lot of feather-smoothing
before I could actually get down to business.
</p>

<p>
"Holy Brother Jason, thank you for your time.  I'm sorry to intrude;
I'm sure you have duties to attend, but I wonder if I could ask for
your help?  I need to find a Chaotic Good Candle of Invocation, and I
suspect that the temple of Ilara is the best place."
</p>

<p>
Jason&mdash;rather, the Holy Brother&mdash;frowned in confusion.
"Yes, of course.  We use them to allow the Brothers to memorize extra
healing spells for morning clinic, and to make first aid attempts more
successful.  What do you need one for?"
</p>

<p>
I smiled crookedly.  "I'd like to use the other power of your
Candles."
</p>

<p>
His frown got deeper.  "What other power?"
</p>

<p>
This was the part I was most excited (and terrified) about.
Apparently, no one here knew of the other power that I had finally
remembered a Candle of Invocation to possess.  According to various
Internet forums that I had read, there was a truly horrible, massively
overpowered exploit available with a Candle...but it depended on the
second power of the Candle, which no one here seemed to be aware of.
I was hoping that this was ignorance instead of a place where this
world diverged from the canonical D&D rules.  Also, I was kicking
myself for not remembering this sooner.
</p>

<p>
"There's a special devotion I'd like to perform that can only be done
with a Candle to aid in concentration," I told him seriously.  It
was...sort of true.  Jedi true, anyway.  I didn't want word of this
trick leaking to anyone not part of my inner circle; it was just too
powerful to spread around.  "Could we please have one of your Candles,
Holy Brother?  I will of course make a sizable donation to your temple
in thanks."
</p>

<p>
The Holy Brother continued frowning for a moment, but then shrugged
and beckoned for us to follow him.  He led us to the main room of the
temple, where Ilara's altar stood in the center of a ring of pews.
The cut and carved trunk of a ten-foot-thick tree, the altar towered
over everything else in the room.  It looked like birds-eye maple, but
no maple tree had ever been large enough to have a spiral staircase
carved into its rim.
</p>

<p>
I waited at the base of the altar until the Holy Brother returned with
a lantern containing what was, presumably, the requested
world-breaking Candle of Holy-God-That's-Awesome.  Honestly, the speed
of his return surprised me even more than his willingness to hand over
the Candle; did he get so many people in here asking for them that
they were kept handily nearby?  I wouldn't think so, but given how
screwed up this world was, who knows?</p>

<p>
As Jason&mdash;I mean, the Holy Brother&mdash;approached, one of the
Landguard stepped smoothly in front of him, relieving him of the
lantern and passing it back while bowing politely and offering
appropriate expressions of gratitude and appreciation.
</p>

<p>
The lantern got inspected and then handed through the various layers
of my protective detail until it reached my gleeful little paws.  I
could barely contain my excitement.
</p>

<p>
There was one critical detail that needed to be handled, so I pushed
through the Landguard until I reached our host.  "Holy Brother, thank
you so much.  Please, you must allow me to give you something in
exchange for the Candle.  Would ten thousand gold be helpful to the
temple?"
</p>

<p>
He bowed, smiling.  "Your offer is generous, My Lord, but unnecessary.
The Candle is yours for nothing.  If you still wish to make a donation
I will be grateful, but payment is not required."
</p>

<p>
That was all I needed to hear.  "Thank you, sir.  I will definitely
make the donation&mdash;Suze, could you please ensure it happens no
later than tomorrow?"  She nodded and I smiled my thanks.  "Holy
Brother, do you mind if I use the Candle now?"
</p>

<p>
He gestured to the empty temple with a wry smile.  "You're certainly
not going to disturb anyone unless you're here until evening service.
Please, make yourself at home.  How may I assist?"  He sounded curious
and eager, and I felt bad about having to tell him he couldn't.
</p>

<p>
I pushed my face into an expression of regret; it was actually hard to
do, since my insides were jumping up and down going
"Squuuuuueeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!" as I gripped the lantern containing
the Candle, but I soldiered on.  
</p>

<p>
"Would it be alright if I asked for privacy?" I asked.  It wasn't hard
to sound abashed; no matter how excited I was by the promise of
infinite cosmic power, I really was embarrassed to be kicking him out
of his own temple.  Especially since I had told him I was going to do
some nifty devotional thing that he didn't know of and had to be
seething with curiousity about.
</p>

<p>
He smiled gently, with more than a hint of regret, but was nice about
it.  "Of course.  I'll be in my quarters.  If you need me, just call."
He bowed respectfully, turned, and paced out of the room.  I was a
little surprised, actually.  He seemed so blas&eacute; about the whole
thing. Did his church have so many Candles that he could pass them out
like Halloween candy without even watching to see how they were used?
Whatever the reason, his cooperation was awfully handy.
</p>

<p>
I couldn't resist actually rubbing my hands together as I contemplated
the power of the simple little light source in front of me, and
exactly how badly I was going to take advantage of it.
</p>

<p>
Here's the thing that I had remembered about the Candle of Invocation:
it is vastly more broken even than the Flobovian "economy."  It has
two powers: grant a cleric of the Candle's alignment a small bonus
when memorizing spells or performing various tasks...or allow the
owner to cast a Gate spell.
</p>

<p>
A Gate spell creates a portal that allows travel to and from another
plane of existence.  It can also summon an extraplanar
creature&mdash;for example, an elemental like Allison.  But there were
other creatures in the Outer and Lower Planes, Horatio, than were
dreamt of by wise-cracking talking campfires.  (Sorry, Bill.  Bit of a
misquote, I know.)  At least two species of extraplanar beasties, the
Efreeti and the Noble Djinn, had the ability to grant Wishes.  And one
thing that Wishes can do is create magic items...including items that
grant Wishes.
</p>

<p>
I sat down crosslegged, tapping my fingers in evilly gleeful
enthusiasm.  I even let myself say "mwahahaha" just once.  It was only
in fun...I wasn't really planning to become an Evil Overlord.
</p>

<p>
Well...maybe just a little?  No, no, definitely not, bad Jake.  Get
thee behind me, O tempting visions of fanatically obedient Legions of
Terror.
</p>

<p>
"Thomas, something large and probably scary looking is going to appear
in just a moment.  Tell everyone to stand down; no one is to attack
unless we are attacked first.  And do <strong>not</strong>, under any
circumstances, use your anti-magic trick.  I repeat,
do <strong>not</strong> use anti-magic while the creature is here.
Clear?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas nodded.  "Understood, M'Lord."  Pitching his voice to carry, he
repeated the orders "Listen up, people!  Incoming, single being,
nonhuman.  Rules of engagement: reactive combat only, negative
mage-suppresion.  Say again, <em>negative</em> mage suppression."
Turning back to me he nodded decisively. "Ready when you are, M'Lord,"
he declared, shifting closer with blades in hand.
</p>

<p>
I could barely keep myself from squeeeing out loud.  This was a
lifelong dream come to fruition; I had wanted magic powers since I was
three years old and now, for a few seconds, I would have them.  I was
no wizard; the Brainopedia gave me descriptions of all the spells, but
I couldn't cast them.  But this...this was different.  The power of
the Candle said that it "allows its owner to cast a Gate spell."  No
restrictions, no "as long as he's already a spellcaster."  Nope, this
was so wide open that even an interdimensional tourist like me could
do it.
</p>

<p>
I opened the lantern and picked up the match the Holy Brother had been
polite enough to provide with it.  Flobovians called them
'tindertwigs', but they were still a stick of wood that burst into
flame when you rubbed it on something rough.  If it quacks like a
duck....
</p>

<p>
Hands shaking with excitement, I struck the match on the purpose-built
rough edge of the lantern and touched the flame to the wick of the
Candle of Infinite Exploitableness.  
</p>

<p>
The moment the wick flared alight, I felt something like sun-sparkles
slip into my mind.  It wasn't visible or audible, it was just energy
with no form.  There was no sense of intelligence or awareness to it
yet it was clearly expectant, waiting for direction.  Before I could
even formulate the thought, it seized upon my intent and surged into
me and through me, a river of shining green light that bore knowledge
on its surface.  For a split second, I understood it all
perfectly&mdash;the true fundamental nature of the multiverse and the
barriers that divided each plane from each other; the relationship and
correspondence of all the planes; the manner in which small
extradimensional spaces could be formed within a plane, like a soap
bubble blown off the wall of reality.  All of it was there, and I
laughed in wonder at the beauty, the elegance, and, above all, the
simplicity of manipulating it.  There was nothing magic about it; it
was no more supernatural than an electric light.  Electrons making
vacuum-sealed tungsten shed photons was no more or less difficult,
when you came right down to it, than unstitching all of reality...all
it took was a deep understanding of the principles and a little energy
applied in exactly the right way.
</p>

<p>
I took hold of reality and paced across the floor, unzipping the walls
of the universe as I went.  When I had a slit twenty feet long I
tugged on it until the edges of reality rolled up like window blinds,
leaving a circle twenty feet across hanging in the air.  The edges
were limned in tongues of black and gold fire and a brilliant emerald
light poured from the hole I had opened in space and time.
</p>

<p>
Stepping back, I laughed again at how simple it all
was. "<em>Gate</em>," I said, the pitch and tone of my voice vibrating
the fabric of reality in a carefully calculated harmonic that fed on
itself, building up and up until it became strong enough to flip the
covers of existence back and pull a creature from another world into
this one.  "Noble Djinn," I declared, telling reality how I wanted it
to be.  This was an exploit in and of itself; the spell said that it
could summon a 'type of creature'.  Summoning "a djinn who happens to
be a noble" could be interpreted as outside of that ability but noble
djinn had an entry unto themselves in the lists of elementals so, by a
very technical definition, they were a separate type and were
therefore summonable.
</p>

<p>
As I spoke, the knowledge vanished.  I remembered remembering it, I
knew that a moment ago I had understood the underpinnings of existence
and how to bend and shape them as I wished.  Despite that, it was all
gone and the world was just as opaque as it had ever been.  I gasped
in physical pain; that remembered understanding, deep knowledge,
comprehension...it had been like the joy I felt when I put on the
Headband, but a million times more powerful.  Without it, the world
felt cold and dark and I was horribly, horribly alone.  I wailed in
misery at the loss.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, I didn't have long to wallow in my sadness; only a moment
after I cast the spell, a giant figure stepped out of the hole I had
opened in reality.
</p>

<p>
"I AM SUMMONED," it boomed.  It was the embodiment of an archetype;
ten feet tall, the upper body of a swarthy man with an impossibly
powerful physique, and a lower body that was a swirl of smoke.  The
djinni wore a sapphire-encrusted golden armband on each arm and on his
head he had a turban capped with a plain gold circlet.
</p>

<p>
"WHO SUMMONS ALAROS, DUKE OF SEVEN WINDS?" the thing thundered; I
swear the walls actually shook.
</p>

<p>
"I did.  I summoned you, Your Grace," I choked out, wiping a tear out
of my eye and clearing my throat to get rid of the lump.  "As your
summoner, I have the right to command you to perform services.  But
I'm not going to.  I want to offer you an opportunity; take it and we
both benefit.  Refuse, and you can go back to your own plane and I'll
give some other djinni the benefit."  That was a bit of a bluff; I
only had the one Candle, and I wasn't sure that Jason would be able to
give me more.  I judged it worth it; the improved probability of
success given a willing djinni as my Wish-granter outweighed the
possibility he might say no.  Plus, I could always compel him later if
I had to.
</p>

<p>
Alaros raised an eyebrow and folded his arms.  "I'M LISTENING," he
boomed, his words bouncing strangely off the wooden walls of the
temple.
</p>

<p>
I rubbed my ear in pain, and considered asking the Duke if he could
please use his inside voice.  A moment's reflection suggested that it
wouldn't be the wisest possible choice.
</p>

<p>
"You have the power to grant three Wishes to your summoner...but no
djinni can grant a Wish to another djinni.  You have this power, but
you can never benefit from it yourself...unless you deal with me.
I'll give you the benefit of two of the Wishes, in exchange for some
considerations."
</p>

<p>
Duke Alaros's eyebrows shot up in amazement.  "Few mortals think to
make this offer, human.  Name your considerations."  I noticed the
boom was gone, which was great news for my progressive hearing loss.
</p>

<p>
"Simple: you agree that all agreements between us, including this one
and the Wish that I will use for myself, will be observed in spirit as
well as in letter and that any ambiguities, interpretations, and / or
choices shall be resolved in the manner most favorable to me.  I Wish
first, and I need to be satisfied by the results of my Wish or you
don't get your own Wishes."
</p>

<p>
Alaros's thunderous laugh rolled across the room.  "Ah, mortal.  You
would deprive me of all the fun!"
</p>

<p>
I shrugged.  "If you want two Wishes for yourself, you agree not to
mess with mine.  Take it or leave it; I'm sure there are other djinn
who would love to make this deal."
</p>

<p>
He laughed again.  "A bargain struck, little mortal!  Make your Wish."
</p>

<p>
I took a deep breath and formulated my wording carefully.  The
creature in front of me was Good, so it wouldn't try to outright kill
or maim me...but it was also Chaotic, so it might not be able to
resist working around our bargain.  After all, it had freely admitted
that mucking with Wishes was fun.
</p>

<p>
"There is a magic item in the Dungeons and Dragons magic items list
named 'Ring of Three Wishes'.  I visualize it as a ring made of
adamantite which resizes itself to fit its wearer securely so that it
will not fall off but can be removed easily when so desired. In my
visualization, there are three rubies inlaid into the band.  The
rubies cannot be harmed while attached to the band but can be removed
and crushed in order to activate them.  Even when removed, the rubies
cannot be damaged by accident but can be crushed easily and harmlessly
between the fingers when desired. When activated, each ruby grants the
wearer of the ring a Wish."
</p>

<p>
Alaros was smiling, arms crossed on his chest.  I could practically
see the sneaky thoughts moving through his head.
</p>

<p>
I took a deep breath and enunciated carefully for this last part.  "My
Wish is that you grant me the result of a Wish phrased such that you
are required to grant me the afore-described Ring of Three Wishes in a
manner that accords with my implicit as well as explicit desires
regarding the ownership of the Ring, the function and nature of the
Ring, and all other aspects and subjects related to my Wish, with the
results of said Wish to be as or more beneficial to me as any Wishes I
make at your behest with my two remaining Wishes."
</p>

<p>
"YOUR WISH IS GRA&mdash;" Alaros began in delight, before pausing.
Looking up, he started mumbling to himself, occasionally making little
back-and-forth gestures with his fingers.
</p>

<p>
After a few seconds, he winced.  "Hang on, I need to write this down.
Can you say that again?"  He conjured parchment and quill from nowhere
and floated down until he could lean over and put his parchment on the
floor.  I repeated my Wish word for word and he scribbled it down as I
went, the tip of his tongue sticking out of the corner of his mouth as
he wrote.
</p>

<p>
When I finished he started mumbling the Wish to himself. "Result of a
Wish...recursive structure, ok.  So phrased...requirement to determine
the wording myself.  Required to grant...implicit as well as
explicit...all aspects and subjects...as or more beneficial...." He
stopped, looking up and thinking, still mumbling to himself but too
softly for me to make it out.
</p>

<p>
Finally he frowned thunderously and looked back at me with a disgusted
twist of his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Fine, mortal, it's not worth the trouble.  Have your Ring," he
grumbled.  With a magician's pass, he produced a metal ring and tossed
it to me.  What was a ring for him was more of a wristband for me, but
when I slipped it on my finger it shrank to fit perfectly.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Your Grace.  Now, what Wishes would you like to have granted?"
</p>

<p>
He harumphed.  "Two of those rings of yours."  
</p>

<p>
I smiled.  "They really are the best choice, aren't they?  Here you
go: for my second Wish, I Wish for a magical ring identical in form
and function to the one currently on my finger, so long as the ring on
my finger precisely matches the form and function of the Ring of Three
Wishes that I Wished for with my first Wish.  For my third Wish, I
wish for a magical ring identical in form and function to the one
currently on my finger, so long as the ring on my finger precisely
matches the form and function of the Ring of Three Wishes that I
Wished for with my first Wish."
</p>

<p>
He pulled the rings out of the air and handed them to me.  "Here.  You
Wished for them, you get them."  He eyed me with a distrustful look,
clearly expecting me to cheat him and keep the rings for myself.
</p>

<p>
I bowed and handed the rings back to him.  "Your Grace, won't you
please accept these two rings as a token of my appreciation for your
assistance?"
</p>

<p>
He seemed pleased, but clearly startled that I had actually kept
faith.  Slipping the rings over his hands, he allowed them to tighten
securely around his wrists.  "For some reason, I always feel better
with bracelets on," he commented amiably before flipping me a casual
three-fingered wave.  "Been a pleasure working for you, mortal.  Enjoy
your Wishes."  There was a slight snicker in his voice when he said
the last, so subtle I almost didn't catch it.  Before I could inquire,
he turned completely to smoke and was rapidly sucked backwards into a
tiny gray ball which promptly popped, presumably returning him to his
home reality.
</p>

<p>
"Mwahahahaha," I cackled, stroking the ring on my finger lovingly.
"Yess, my preciousss...infinite Wishes are mine!  Mwahahaha!" I
stretched out expansively, twisting into the classic bodybuilder pose
and clenching my muscles with a grunted "Huuuuunnnhhhhh!"  (It was not
nearly as impressive as when the Governator does it.)  "<em>Infinite
Cosmic Power</em>!  And no itty-bitty living space, either!"
</p>

<p>
Thomas was starting to look more than slightly concerned for my
sanity.
</p>

<p>
It took a good minute before I could bring myself to stop drooling
over the metaphorical meal and start metaphorically eating it.  (Which
was, perhaps, a terrible metaphor when discussing a ring made of metal
far harder than steel.  Although, dentistry here was pretty
phenomenal.  Meh, whatever.)
</p>

<p>
Three Wishes remaining.
</p>

<p>
I extracted the first ruby from the band, crushed it between my
fingers, and allowed the fine red dust to drift to the floor.  "I Wish
to have, in my left hand, a Ring of Three Wishes that is identical in
form and function to the one on my finger, with the exception that the
new Ring shall have all three rubies in it."
</p>

<p>
Five Wishes remaining.
</p>

<p>
The other two rubies went the way of the first and soon I had three
adamantine Rings of Three Wishes clinking in my hand.
</p>

<p>
Nine Wishes remaining.  I cackled gleefully and, tucking the
now-expended Ring into a pocket of my jeans, I slipped one of the
others on my finger.
</p>

<p>
The world froze around me.  Lightning flashed, thunder cracked like
two bullet trains slamming head-on into each other and I went flying
back to slam into the wooden wall of the temple.  When my eyes cleared
I was suspended five feet off the floor by a very tall woman who had
her hand clamped under my jaw.  And by tall I mean 'Duke Alaros would
need stilts to dance with her.'  If I had to guess, I'd say she was in
her early forties; she was rangy and weatherbeaten, with laughlines
around her eyes and mouth that said she smiled easily and often.  She
certainly wasn't smiling now; her eyes were literally flashing, tiny
sparks leaping out of them. The air around her crackled like an
imminent thunderstorm, and the air reeked of ozone.
</p>

<p>
So, the thing about being held up by your neck: it's really
uncomfortable.  She wasn't closing off my airway, she just had her
fingers jammed up under my lower jaw.  Despite this generosity, I
really wished she would put me down.
</p>

<p>
"<strong>How <em>dare</em> you, mortal?  How dare you stretch beyond
the bounds?  How dare you reach for divinity?!"</strong>  Her voice
was like red hot icepicks being rammed into my skull; I screamed and
pressed my hands to my ears, trying to block out the agonizing echoes,
but they were inside my head now and had to simply be endured.
</p>

<p>
"I...I wasn't...what bounds?  I wasn't trying to be a god, I just
wanted some Wishes."  I was too rattled by her terrifying presence to
think straight, to fully grasp what was happening. What was she
talking about?  What 'bounds'?  Just to add to the fun quotient, I
could see all the Landguard stuck in freeze-frame again, which meant
this was probably another bloody god.  Really unfair thing about gods;
they don't feel a need to let you keep your bodyguard with you.

"Hang on there a second, Illy," Harlequin put in from where he
lounged, upside down and unsupported, on the wall next to me.
</p>

<p>
She transferred her gaze from me to him and frowned even deeper.  When
she finally spoke, her voice was more of a sigh, much like the
exasperated tone of an older sister to her obnoxious younger brother.
"I told you not to call me that.  What do you want, Wilgam?  And
turn around."
</p>

<p>
He spun 'round on his center of mass like a pinwheel, not touching the
wall or changing his posture at all.  When he was right-side-up, his
shirt and hair fell upwards.  He pulled the shirt back down and held
it with one hand while conjuring a pipe with the other and blowing
bubbles out of it.
</p>

<p>
"Good to see you, cuz," Trickster offered insouciantly.  "Oh, I'm
going by Loki around the kid; that was one of my more successful names
in his world.  Anyway, I've kinda got this deal on with him, and I'd
really appreciate it if you could hold off on snapping him in half
until he's paid off his debt to me."
</p>

<p>
She glared at him for a moment, then folded her arms across her chest.
I plummeted to the ground, landing hard and twisting my ankle.
</p>

<p>
"His breaking of the Edict supercedes your claim," she announced with
the tone of a horse trader making an opening bid.
</p>

<p>
"Weeellllll, that's not <em>entirely</em> clear, now is it? The Edict
originally came down from Shailos, and you know what a stickler he is
for that whole 'fairness' and 'honor' thing."  Jumping to his feet, he
grew to match her height so that he could throw an arm around her
shoulders, shaking his head in dismay.  She shook it off but he
affected not to notice.  "I mean, sure, you and I might think Shailos
is a bit cracked for caring about that stuff, but it's what he's into,
so we should probably factor it in.  And the mortals don't even
remember the Edict.  Remember, they're just mayflies; a century sees
entire generations dead and buried, and it's been over <em>sixty</em>
centuries since Shailos handed down the Edict.  He would say that, if
they don't know about it, it's not 'fair'"&mdash;he actually did the
air quotes&mdash;"to punish them for breaking it.  At least, not
kill-you or torture-your-soul-forever kinds of punishments."
</p>

<p>
She got a sour face on her look, the universal expression that means
'I know you're right and I don't want to admit it.'  "Why do you care,
Loki?  If Shailos wants me to forgive the little rodent, let Shailos
come and say so, no need for you to stick your nose into a perfectly
simple offense," she grumbled.  Things were definitely looking up;
'grumbling' was about ten thousand times more awesome than
'<em>Special Attack: Wave Motion Eyeball Cannons of Nuclear
Rage!</em>'
</p>

<p>
Loki pretended to consider that.  "Hmm...yeah, that's not a bad way to
look at it," he said thoughtfully.  My eyes got big as my champion
appeared to desert me, but I wasn't about to draw attention by moving,
or talking, or breathing.
</p>

<p>
Loki's smile suddenly got cruel, and little devil horns popped out of
his head.  "Of course...there's punishments and punishments.  I mean,
sure, you could just tear his arms off and erase his existence from
the fundamental fabric of reality as a warning to others.  A little
declass&eacute;, but you could do it."  He shrugged and sniffed, the
very picture of a refined gentleman considering the words of a
backwoods bumpkin.  "It would be over quick and you could get back to
whatever you were doing.  Wouldn't really have that much effect on the
others, though.  Hardly any of them would see it or hear about it more
than third hand.  It wouldn't seem real to them and it probably
wouldn't prevent the next idiot from trying the same 'infinite Wishes'
thing.  Then we'd have to be back here shredding <em>his</em> soul
too, and that just gets tedious after a while.  Work, work, work.  I
mean, really&mdash;if Shailos wants to go around pontificating and
handing down Edicts, why doesn't <em>he</em> enforce them ?  Why
do <em>we</em> have to do all the work?"
</p>

<p>
He looked at her frankly, spreading his arms in justifiable
exasperation with whoever this Shailos was.  She nodded and started
talking with her hands.  "Seriously!  He's just gotten way too big for
his robes this past millenium or so!  Can you believe what he's got
them calling him these days?  'The True God!'  Honestly, could you get
more arrogant?!"
</p>

<p>
Loki nodded seriously.  "Preach it, sister.  He always has been a bit
of a cheese-brain.  This is exactly the kind of thing I'd expect from
him, this whole 'True this' and 'True that' and 'Ilara and Loki aren't
real' and blah blah blah.  Arrogant little punk.  I remember him back
when he was just joining the pantheon."  He grimaced.  "Things have
changed a bit since then, haven't they?"  He shook his head
regretfully and she nodded rueful agreement.
</p>

<p>
"You know, screw Shailos," Loki snarled.  "Screw him and his precious
Edicts.  I'm not doing his grunt work any more!  I'm not going to
waste my time burning books, erasing memories, punishing random
mortals, and on and on and on.  What does he think we are, his lap
dogs?  Forget this, I'm going off to Deklos for a drink."  He turned
and started to walk away, then looked back over his shoulder.  "Hey,
you want to join me?  There's this little hole-in-the-wall down on the
docks; pretty skeezy neighborhood, but I swear, the owner is the best
brewer on this planet." He grinned.  "And who knows?  We might find
some mortals looking for trouble.  That's always fun.  What do you
say, O Goddess of Travel&mdash;want to take a quick trip with me?  I'm
dying to hear what you're doing these days; rumor has it that you've
come up with some great refinements for spreading the faith."
</p>

<p>
He threw a companionable arm over her shoulders, subtly turning her
away from me.  The two of them walked off, chatting amiably as they
faded slowly away.  Just before they vanished completely, Loki threw a
glance back at me and winked.
</p>

<p>
The time freeze was still in place, but it would only last a few more
seconds.  I pulled two rubies out of the first ring, all three out of
the second, and started Wishing as fast as I could.
</p>

<p>
"I Wish I were smarter."
</p>

<p>
"I Wish I were smarter."
</p>

<p>
"I Wish I were smarter."
</p>

<p>
"I Wish I were smarter."
</p>

<p>
"I Wish I were smarter."
</p>

<p>
The wave hit, hard.  And suddenly, things that I had been missing
clicked together into a terrifying whole.
</p>

<p>
<em><strong>Note for D&D rules pedants, everyone else may skip
this:</strong> I took a small liberty with Jake's Wishing for more
Wishes by not dealing with the XP issue.  There's a trivial fix (Wish
for Rings that have extra XP in them) and it wasn't worth the extra
complication to deal with it in the text. (Also, I didn't realize that
this was an issue until a reviewer pointed it out.  But it still
wasn't worth dealing with in the text.)</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Full answer with all the fussbudgety details:</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Using Wish to create a magic item requires that you burn XP to pay
for the item you are creating.  Since Jake has no XP of his own, the
XP would need to have come from the Ring.  Rings of Three Wishes do
not, by default, come with extra XP to pay for item creation.  Ok, but
he could wish for a Ring that had extra XP, right?  Yes, but then when
he used that Ring to create another Ring, he would need to burn more
XP from the first one to pay for the XP in the second one, plus the
basic cost of the new Ring itself.  The second generation of Rings
would therefore have fewer XP imbued into it than the first, the third
would have fewer than the second, and so on. You couldn't actually
create infinite Rings of Three Wishes this way.</p>
</p>

<p>
<em>If you are sufficiently pedantic to be bothered by this, just
assume that Jake actually made the following Wishes: For the first
Ring he said "I Wish for a Ring of Three Wishes that contains Graham's
Number of extra XP." For all following Rings he said: "I wish for a
Ring of Three Wishes containing the maximum amount of extra XP that I
can get for a total cost of one third of the XP originally imbued in
my current Ring."</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Graham's Number is ridiculously, insanely, mind-bogglingly huge
(check Wikipedia), and creating a Ring of Three Wishes only requires
36,836 XP (base cost) plus the extra XP you want to put in it.  If you
started with Graham's number of XP and you wished for another Ring
every second, you would die of old age long before you had made an
appreciable dent in the XP you started with...even if you were a
dragon or some other stupidly-long-lived race.  Then your children and
grandchildren could do the same thing until they either died of old
age or got tired of making these Wishes and went out for pizza.  This
is close enough to "infinite" for any practical purposes.
</em>
</p>

</p>

<p>
<em><strong>Note for math pedants:</strong> Yes, I know that it should
be "Graham's number", not "Graham's Number".  It was easier to read
this way.</em>
