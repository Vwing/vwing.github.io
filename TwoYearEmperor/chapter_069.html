<p>
"Explain to me why I need you now," Afi demanded in a voice as cold
and unforgiving as Fimbulwinter.
</p>

<p>
My brain stumbled; I reached for a reply and got <em>Error: reply not
found</em>.  I had a very intense, but fortunately very private,
freakout: Afi really didn't need us anymore, and there was absolutely
no reason for him not to kill us all.  Oh crap.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, Drifa stepped into the breach.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you need us, you ask?" she said with a note of challenge, and
more than a hint of smugness.  "Because even your <em>God</em> is
scared of Herr&uacute;n, and I'm her mother."
</p>

<p>
Afi cocked his skull in the lichly equivalent of raising an eyebrow,
glancing at the Ice Assassin who had led us in.  "Hm," he said,
looking back to Drifa with a considering tone in his voice.  "So you
are...I shall need to have a word with my doorwardens about what
information to include in report summaries."
</p>

<p>
He turned back to the Ice Assassin.  "Mindscrape," he said, ripping
the memories out of his clone's head.  He drummed his fingers for a
moment on the arm of the throne, clearly sorting through his new
knowledge.  "Hm.  Yes, several important things were not included."
He paused, thinking some more, then refocused on the Ice Assassin.
"Time mark: now.  You have failed me, 1586.  Your report was
incomplete in important ways.  Aside from that, you and these others
have learned things you should not.  Take yourself and these others
back to the Receiving Room. Mindscrape all knowledge of the last hour
from all those there; replace it with memories of uneventful guarding
and no visitors.  Mindscrape yourself similarly.  Retain the memories
of everything after the most recent time mark.  After you finish,
these"&mdash;he gestured at the Afis guarding us&mdash;"may take up
guard duty; you will go stand in the Symbol of Pain room until I call
for you.  I believe 204199 is standing there at the moment, and his
month is up; you may tell him that he's free to go."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Creator," responded the Afi clone.  He bowed low and hurried
away, the Afi-guards and Greater Shadows trailing along behind.
</p>

<p>
I looked around; we were still surrounded by four of the shadowy
golems, but aside from that we were unguarded.  I glanced at Thomas,
raising an eyebrow in inquiry.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, stop," Afi said in disgust.  "Dispel Magic."  He flicked a finger
at the space behind us, and suddenly the paving stones were replaced
with several dozen more Ice Assassins of the master lich, leaving the
floor pocked with small holes.  They turned as one to face us, dark
fires burning in their eye sockets and arcane power rippling almost
visibly off their ancient bones.
</p>

<p>
I looked around at the number of floor tiles that surrounded us and
resolved to be <em>very</em> polite.
</p>


<p>
When I looked up again, Albrecht was smiling.  "So, you're onboard.
Good," he said to Afi, confidence in his tone.
</p>

<p>
Afi looked at him; if he'd had lips, I'm sure they would have been
curved in a smile.  "Good indeed.  A pleasure to know that I'm not
dealing with an idiot."
</p>

<p>
I tried to suppress a frown of confusion but evidentally failed to
suppress it enough; Afi glanced at me and sighed.  "Perhaps I spoke
too soon."  He glanced at Thomas's impassive face and cocked his head.
"What about you, paladin?  Can you explain it to your emperor?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas turned slightly so he was facing me but could still see Afi in
his peripheral vision.  "Afi can communicate with his Ice Assassins
mentally, yet he gave the commands to erase their knowledge verbally;
the only reason was because he wanted us to know.  He's removing the
knowledge of our plan to prevent it from being available to Death once
He manifests, and he wants us to know that that's what he's doing."
He paused, flicking a sideways glance at Afi.  When he continued,
there was a slightly wolfish tone behind his words.  "Also, he is
excising your otherworldly knowledge&mdash;this 'science' and
'RAW'&mdash;from the minds of his minions, implying that he does not
entirely trust them despite their supposedly unbreakable obedience."
He turned to face Afi head on, sending a defiant look up the steps to
the ancient lich.  "Accurate, O Lich?"
</p>

<p>
<em>Clap...Clap...Clap.</em> The walls echoed with the sound of bony
hands coming together in sarcastic applause.  "Indeed," Afi said,
giving Thomas a nod of acknowledgement.
</p>

<p>
I felt as uncomfortable as any other student forced to wear the dunce
cap in front of everyone, but I made myself shake it off.  I summoned
confidence, looked up at Afi and put on my best poker face...while
carefully <em>not</em> thinking about the fact that every time I'd
ever played poker I'd been completely cleaned out.  Even when playing
against my nine-year-old nephew.
</p>

<p>
Afi considered me for a moment, then gave me a nod.  "So.  This plan
of yours, Jacob.  There are some flaws."
</p>

<p>
I gave him a smile and an interested look.  "Oh?  Such as?"
</p>

<p>
"For one thing," Afi said. "Without my soul I would be unable to
regenerate at my phylactery, and would therefore be vulnerable to true
destruction."
</p>

<p>
I shrugged casually, revelling in my lack of fear&mdash;the unshakable
courage granted by standing in the middle of a troop of paladins was
awesome.  (Actually, what was the correct collective noun for
paladins?  A troop?  A force?  A rampart?  Ooh, I liked that one.
Yes, standing in the middle of a rampart of paladins was fantastic for
the 'aura of courage' bennies.)  "Have you got a better idea?  You've
got a shard of one of the most powerful gods in creation&mdash;if
not <em>the</em> most powerful&mdash;stapled to your soul.  You're not
going to pry that loose with mortal magic."  It suddenly hit me that I
was not, strictly speaking, talking to a mortal.  I waved
dismissively.  "You know what I mean&mdash;by any magic that you have
access to.  Only Death himself could extract the shard, so this is
pretty much the only game in town."
</p>

<p>
Turns out, an animated skeleton can do a <em>really</em> good poker
face.  I had absolutely no idea what he was thinking behind those
deep-sunk eye sockets.
</p>

<p>
"Hm," he said after a moment.  "I suppose."  He paused, gazing up in
thought.  "Of course, the part that truly bothers me is the continuity
flaw," he said, locking his eyes back on me.  "Given that, in this
universe, identity truly <em>is</em> defined by a soul, how could this
be considered to save <em>my</em> existence?"
</p>

<p>
Again I shrugged.  "What makes you say that identity is defined by a
soul?  Mindscrape lets you rearrange a person's head
completely&mdash;if you polymorph a Good person into a troll, then
Mindscrape it to be Evil, destroy every memory it's ever had, and
replace it with the memory that it's actually a unicorn enchanted to
be a troll by a psychotic, purple-haired troll fairy...haven't you
pretty much destroyed the person?  Even if you killed the body and
resurrected it, it would come back with the same mind&mdash;you
couldn't get the original person back."
</p>

<p>
"I...suppose," he said again, more dubiously than before.  "You could
recover it with a Wish spell, but your point still stands."
</p>

<p>
With Thomas and the Landguard radiating courage at me I wasn't really
feeling fear&mdash;oh, I could feel it, off in the distance, but it
wasn't actually touching me.  Despite that, my heart gave a little
lurch when he didn't go for it immediately.  Quickly, I rummaged
around in the thoughtweb that was my mental representation of Afi and
his motivations...and the answer came to mind.
</p>

<p>
"Besides," I said, speaking in a tone that whispered of gleeful
schemes and invitation to join in trickery.  "Just think&mdash;you'll
be out from under him, <em>regardless of how the rest of the plan
goes.</em>  If our plan works, you're in the clear forever and could
even reclaim your soul so that you have the ability to regenerate at
your phylactery again.  If we fail, Death will be absolutely certain
that you're dead, and he won't come looking for you.  You win either
way."
</p>

<p>
Afi spent several of the longest seconds of my life pondering, then
nodded in decision.  "Very well.  We shall do this.  But not as you
thought it&mdash;Mindscrape won't suffice, as it can only edit
memories.  We'll need to use Programmed Amnesia so that I can implant
a trigger that will allow me to undo the changes when the time comes."
</p>

<p>
He turned his gaze of the Ice Assassins and waved a hand.  "29816,
711089, attend me."  Two of the formerly-paving-stone copies of him
hurried to join him beside the throne; 29816 lay down on the dias at
Afi's feet while 711089 stood before him.  Once they were in position,
all of the other Ice Assassins moved to stand on one of the empty
spots in the floor, pointed at themselves, and said "Polymorph Any
Object: Ice Assassin to paving stone."  Suddenly, the floor was
pristine again, aside from two holes.
</p>

<p>
Afi watched all this happen and nodded in satisfaction to
himself. Pressing a hidden catch, he retrieved a wand from the armrest
of his throne, tapped himself on the head with it and said "Programmed
Amnesia."  Nodding in satisfaction, he passed the wand to 711089.
</p>


<p>
"Goodbye, 29816," Afi said calmly, looking at the Ice Assassin who lay
at his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Goodbye, Creator," replied the Ice Assassin.  He paused, and then
spoke again, an ironic chuckle in his voice.  "It would appear that I
shall see my purpose achieved after all."
</p>

<p>
Afi snorted in amusement.  "Indeed...at least, from a certain point of
view."  He centered himself on his throne and nodded to the Ice
Assassin who stood over them to indicate his readiness.  "Be sure that
there is no gap between my awakening and my reversion to true form.
It would not do for me to notice the change."
</p>

<p>
The Icefi standing above his creator nodded in acknowledgement, then
pointed at Afi.  "Polymorph Any Object: Lich to human."  Suddenly, Afi
was gone and a thread-thin Latin man sat in his place.  He smiled for
a moment, then composed himself and dropped off to sleep with the
ridiculous ease that Stupidworlders have.
</p>

<p>
My companions stood in bafflement as they watched the weird sequence
that followed; I hadn't explained this part of the plan to them, so
they were trying to figure out what was happening.  The answer was
simple, of course: Afi was getting rid of the godshard by migrating
into a new body and leaving his soul behind.  
</p>

<p>
"Polymorph Any Object: Ice Assassin to elf," said the standing Icefi,
pointing at the prone 29816.  Immediately, the Ice Assassin's form
blurred, fading into an elf.  The elf looked at its fleshy hands and
chuckled, then composed itself as had its creator and dropped off to
sleep as well.
</p>

<p>
"Mindscrape," said Icefi 711089, retrieving all the memories from the
now-human Afi.
</p>

<p>
"Mindscrape," he said again, overwriting 29816's mind and memories
with Afi's.  "Programmed Amnesia," it said, flicking the wand at the
elf-that-was-the-new-bodied Afi.
</p>

<p>
"Mindscrape," he said again, overwriting 29816's mind and memories
with Afi's.
</p>

<p>
Pointing the wand at the sleeping human-that-was-formerly-Afi, 711089
commanded "Programmed Amnesia" and twisted the wand in a series of
precise flicks.
</p>


<p>
"Dismiss Polymorph Any Object," it said pointing to the
former-29816-now-Afi; the elf faded back into its lich form and stood
up.
</p>

<p>
"Hm," the now-Afi said, taking a moment to survey its new body.
"Interesting."  It studied the man on the throne pensively for a few
long seconds, then shrugged and turned to us.
</p>

<p>
"You have fifteen minutes to put your plan in motion, or my Ice
Assassins will kill you.  Until then, my original body will behave as
I normally would, but it will be programmed to believe that
cooperating with you is somewhat to its advantage&mdash;not enough to
take significant risks over, but enough that it will be willing to
summon Death for you.  It will not remember your plans for Death, and
it will not remember this ritual.  Likewise, once I step off this
dias, <em>I</em> will not remember, nor will my other Ice Assassins.
In order to ensure that Death cannot find me, when I step off the dias
I will revert to having the mind and memories of the original 29816.
Tomorrow I shall become myself again&mdash;by then, you and Death
will have settled your differences and either he'll be gone or my
original body and my soul will be destroyed, so he won't be looking
for me."  He paused, staring at us intently.
</p>


<p>
"Do not believe that I am less of a threat to you," he continued
seriously.  "I used the Programmed Amnesia that I cast on myself to
modify all of my Ice Assassins; they will obey this new body, but not
be aware of why.  Do not speak of the ritual to anyone, or enlighten
any of my Ice Assassins as to the reasons they must obey this body.
Should you break either of these commands, I will bend every resource
at my disposal to obliterate everything you care about.  Not you.
Just the people and things that you love.  Are we entirely clear?"  He
paused, meeting each of our gazes in turn until he received a sign of
agreement.  Once he was sure that we understood the seriousness of the
situation, he gave us a shallow half-bow.
</p>

<p>
"I bid you farewell."  With a muttered 'Greater Teleport,' he
vanished.
</p>

<p>
711089 waited until its master was gone, then slid the wand back into
the armrest of the throne.  Bending down, he shook the shoulder of the
man on the throne.  "Master, wake up."  In the same instant that the
man's eyes opened, 711089 said "Dismiss Polymorph Any Object" and
straightened, turning to face us so that he stood in an unsuspicious
guard position beside the body of the lich that was Afi...or, at
least, one of him.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, your arguments are convincing.  I shall grant you your
audience with my Lord," Afi said, completely unaware that we had not
actually made the arguments that he was remembering.  He stood up,
paced down the steps to stand beside us, and turned to face his
throne.  With arms upraised, he called "Lord Neklos!  Turn your gaze
upon us, Lord Neklos!  Grant us your presence, Lord Neklos!  These
mortals beseech you, Lord Neklos!"
</p>

<p>
Long seconds dragged by...five...eight...ten...twelve...the world
suddenly blinked like a glitch in the Matrix. When I looked around,
Drifa, Unn, Isaac, Reynard, and all of the Landguard were gone and
Afi's throne was occupied by an enormous figure in spiky black armor
straight out of a Frank Frazetta painting.  His gauntleted right hand
was turned palm up; above it spun ten shining black gems the size of
quail eggs, each one pulsing and glowing with a sickly purple light.
</p>

<p>
<strong>"Hello, mortal,"</strong> rumbled the God of Death.  From
where she stood slightly behind me, I heard Suze whimper.  I would
have done the same, but my throat was completely blocked by a giant
lump of ice.
</p>

<p>
"Hel&mdash;" my voice squeaked and cut me off.  I cleared my throat and
tried again.  "Hello, Lord Neklos.  Thank you for coming."
</p>

<p>
He stared at me a moment longer, then looked consideringly at the gems
that orbited his hand.  "These are your friends, you know," he said
thoughtfully.  He flicked a finger and the gems spun out to pass in
front of my eyes one by one.  Inside each stone, I saw a miniature
version of one of my companions beating on the walls of the
gem&mdash;frantically, in Isaac's case, furiously in Duncan's.
</p>

<p>
Another finger-flick and the gems swooped back to Neklos, dropping
into a leather pouch on the steps of the dias.
</p>

<p>
"I find you amusing, little mortal," the God of Death told me.  "You
came to do battle with Me and only brought a dozen companions...one of
them your <em>executive assistant.</em>" He glanced at Suze and gave a
disparaging sniff.  "Do you know, I had to ask around to find out that
an 'executive assistant' is just a secretary?  What kind of person
brings a defenseless girl to a battle with
a <em><strong>God?</strong></em>"
</p>

<p>
I swallowed.  This had gone really, really pearshaped really, really
fast.  My whole plan had been predicated on the fact that we'd see
Neklos appearing and could get the jump on him...of course, my plan
had also been predicated on the idea that we'd actually <em>still have
our magic items and buffs!</em>  True Seeing, Haste...all kinds of
useful things, and they hadn't even made it out of the Receiving Room.
I took a moment to spare a part for that traitorous, slippery,
weaselish, conniving, Benedict Arnold ratbastard Icefi for not telling
us what would happen when we arrived.  The thought featured chains, a
horse, and twenty miles of gravel and broken glass.
</p>

<p>
Okay, enough fantasizing.  I was pretty much screwed at this
point&mdash;no casters left, no items, no route for escape.
Fortunately, Albrecht had designed a whole series of backup plans for
when&mdash;not if&mdash;things went unexpectedly off the rails.  Plan
A had been shutting down Neklos so we didn't have to deal with him any
more, but that had been predicated on getting to cast before he could
act.  Plan B...well, at this point I figured that Plan B was pretty
well shot, as were C, D, E, and basically everything through to the
end of the alphabet.  That left me reduced to the go-to-hell plan,
which basically amounted to "talk really fast and try not to die."  I
spared an idle moment to regret that we couldn't use Plan M; Colborn
died in Plan M.  I liked Plan M.
</p>

<p>
"Actually, Your Lordship, we weren't here to fight you.  We came to
negotiate," I said, doing my absolute best to sound relaxed and
confident, and being very careful not to meet his eyes.  Instead, I
stared at his right knee, which was about at my eye level&mdash;albeit
almost thirty feet away as I stood at the base of the dais.  I was
assuming that divine hearing was sufficient that I didn't need to
shout.  Certainly I hadn't done so when I was talking to Afi, and I
assumed that Neklos had hearing as least as good as a mere Lich King.
</p>

<p>
There was a booming noise like the door on a mausoleum banging open
and shut in the wind.  I risked a quick glance up and saw that the
horrible noise was Neklos laughing, full-throated and head thrown
back.
</p>

<p>
"And why would I want to negotiate, little mortal?
I'm <em>winning,</em>" he asked with an amused tone that left my spine
crawling.
</p>

<p>
In my peripheral vision, I saw Suze trembling.  She was white as a
freshly-bleached sheet, but I gave her props&mdash;she hadn't fallen
over, her chin was up, and there were no tears.  That was at least as
good as I was doing, and she didn't seem to be having any trouble
breathing, which was more than I was managing; getting words out
required paying a lot of attention to making my lungs work.  Doing
that while looking calm and unruffled was really just not on the
table...or, in fact, anywhere near the table.  Possibly not even in
the same room as the table.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, Drifa had already answered a similar question, so I was
good to go.  "Why should you negotiate, Dread Lord?" I responded.
"Well, for one thing, Herr&uacute;n likes us," I said, hoping that I
was actually playing a full house instead of a high-card deuce.
</p>

<p>
Neklos's eyebrow went up.  "Herr&uacute;n has been dead for millenia.
I led the campaign that killed her."
</p>

<p>
I felt the freezing knot in my stomach unknot just a bit.  Maybe I
actually had some cards to play here.
</p>

<p>
"Not anymore," I told him, pushing as much certainty into my voice as
possible.  "We resurrected her.  In fact, you've got her mother locked
up in one of those gems."  I pointed at the bag of gems sitting on the
steps at Neklos's feet.  "She seems to like her mom, too, so I think
she'll be very motivated to get her back.  And she seems to like me
and the rest of my friends too so...capturing or killing us?  Maybe
not the best plan."
</p>

<p>
Interesting factoid: having the God of Death frown at you while a
black aura crackles around him and the whispered screams of thousands
of tortured souls fill the air is kinda intimidating.
</p>

<p>
The silence dragged on and on, and the sounds of the screaming souls
began to get louder, sounding like the air being torn apart around the
Lord of the Grave.  Desperately, I groped for some topic to distract
him.
</p>

<p>
"Uh...so, one question, if I may?" I asked timidly.  "How did you nab
everyone like that?  Looks like you used Trap the Soul on them, and
that's a targeted spell&mdash;only affects one person.  How'd you get
ten of them off before any of us saw or heard anything?  You couldn't
have done it from inside that Time Stop&mdash;you can't target people
when you're Time Stopped...or, well, maybe you can?  Can Gods do
that?  Because, if so, that is seriously some cheaty bullshit right
there."
</p>

<p>
The more important question suddenly occurred to me.  "For that
matter, how did you even know to do it?  'Cause, gotta say, that's
just impressive as hell.  You're either powerful enough that you can
tell the rules to kiss off, or you're one magnificently clever
bastard.  Either way, I'm definitely impressed.  I don't suppose you'd
mind sharing?"
</p>

<p>
It took a few seconds, but the tortured screams faded away and
Neklos's posture relaxed.  He leaned back, giving me a superior smile
as he crossed his legs, right ankle on left knee.
</p>

<p>
"Simplicity," he snorted.  "When I heard the call of My Hand"&mdash;he
flicked a finger at Afi, standing quietly a few feet to my
left&mdash;"I turned My gaze here to see why.  I saw that little
rodent L&ouml;fgren standing there, and I spent a moment searching the
minds of the recently dead souls to find who the rest of you were.  It
was obvious that you were here because you thought you had some way to
battle me; I could have just killed you, but I was puzzled by why
L&ouml;fgren was standing behind someone as powerless as <em>you</em>,
little otherworlder.  I was curious, so I decided to indulge and find
out what you were thinking."
</p>

<p>
I nodded thoughtfully; the idea that he could gather intelligence from
the dead&mdash;especially that he could do it virtually
instantly&mdash;was terrifying.  That was almost as powerful an
intelligence advantage as Herr&uacute;n's direct knowledge of secrets.
</p>

<p>
"Impressive.  So, that's the why...what about the how?" I asked
carefully.
</p>

<p>
He offered me a smug smile and a casual smile.  "It wasn't hard.  I'm
the God of Death&mdash;casting necromantic spells is part of my
portfolio, and I can take any action within my portfolio as a free
action.  Ten Trap the Souls and your troublesome little friends were
out of the way."  He made a dismissive gesture towards us.  "I decided
to leave you uncaptured for a bit; you're no threat and I have to
admit that I was curious as to why you brought her and what you
intended."
</p>

<p>
This seemed to be working&mdash;getting him to go all monologue-y
about how brilliant he was and how awesomely he out-Munchkined us had
calmed him down and, more importantly, kept him from killing us all
with an irritatingly casual flick of his godly finger.  Yay, winning
strategy.  Keep doing it!
</p>

<p>
"So, you transported in behind us, got a surprise round, and took
everyone out," I said, nodding in thoughtful respect.  "Then a Time
Stop so you could seem to appear on the throne, just for the drama."
I looked up at him with forced respect.  "Impressive.  I can see why
you've become one of the most powerful gods."
</p>

<p>
The frown was suddenly back.  "<em>The</em> most powerful!" he
snapped.
</p>

<p>
I raised my hands in submission.  "Absolutely!  Sorry.  Yes.  You
undoubtedly have more worshippers than anyone else, so you're clearly
the most powerful.  From what I hear, Arros, Shailos, and some of the
others&mdash;Mika maybe?&mdash;have been struggling just to shield a
few limited areas from Your view.  Being the Lord of Magic, Arros is
definitely really powerful, so if Arros is struggling against you,
that says something.  And, of course, Shailos is pretty
badass&mdash;he actually pulled me through time to retroactively
resurrect me, did you know that?  Yep, Shailos seems pretty badass
indeed.  I don't know that much about Mika, but I'd guess that the
Lady of Music, Mistress of Bards...well, I guess she could do some
pretty impressive leadership or charm stuff, but that probably
wouldn't measure up against you.  And, of course, Amilsandre, the Lady
of Home and Hearth...well, I saw Amilsandre and Loki fighting.
Amilsandre seemed pretty damn dangerous to me, and I know that Loki has
some pretty good tricks up his sleeve.  I've actually been talking to
Loki a fair bit...well, to Loki and Herr&uacute;n.  Herr&uacute;n, the
Lady of Secrets and Knowledge...there's a mouthful, huh?  Still,
Herr&uacute;n seems like a pretty cool lady&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Neklos laughed indulgently and waved me to silence.  "Stop calling for
help, little mortal.  None of the others will care to oppose me
directly.  Even if you manage to attract their attention, they aren't
going to suddenly appear to save you."
</p>

<p>
I gave him my best unrepentant smile and a brief shrug.  "Can't blame
a guy for trying, huh?"
</p>

<p>
He chuckled slightly, seeming amused in a
pulling-the-wings-off-flies-is-fun way.  That superiority was his only
weakness that I could see...the only thing that I had to work with.
If I could keep him entertained long enough, keep him enjoying his
total control of the situation, maybe something would turn
up.  <em>~Scheherazade, I don't know if you're a goddess&mdash;or if
you're in this universe at all&mdash;but, if you are, I could really
use some help here!~</em>
</p>

<p>
Beside me, Suze tentatively raised a hand a few inches.  "Excuse me,"
she said timorously.  "May I please ask something, Dark Lord?"
</p>

<p>
I blinked in amazement, my thoughts derailing.  What the hell was she
doing?  Don't attract his attention, Suze!  Damnit, you shouldn't
even <em>be</em> here!  I'm probably dead, and the others are going to
spend eternity trapped in some chunks of carborundum (or whatever the
hell it was), but at least you might have survived if you hadn't been
quite so damn bloody-minded as to follow me into this hellhole.
</p>

<p>
Neklos looked at her in the same way that you would look at a kitten
that was meowing for attention while you were trying to work.  "What
do you want, girl?" he said, giving her a nod of permission to speak.
</p>

<p>
She took a tentative half-step forward.  She was trembling, and my
heart went out to the poor kid.  The others had at least been
warriors, but she never asked for this.
</p>

<p>
She reached back, groping blindly until she could wrap her tiny, cold
fingers around my hand for reassurance.  "Please, Dark Lord&mdash;I
don't want to die.  Please, at least consider my Emperor's offer?  I
know that we don't have very much to offer, Dark Lord, but I was
hoping that I could convince you to let us retrieve spell component of
Major Creation: antimatter osmium sufficient to destroy twenty foot
radius; Plane Shift; Celerity; Polymorph Any Object: paving stone to
singularity of one billion solar masses."
</p>

<p>
Time seemed to slow as though it waded through molasses as I watched
multiple impossible things happening all at once.  Suze pointed at the
floor beside us and spoke the Words; the stone shimmered and twisted
into something tiny and black that hurt my eyes to look at.  I could
almost see the gravitational waves reaching out to us with a hunger
that would rip us to shreds at the faintest touch.  As the waves oozed
closer, Suze's free hand dipped into the pouch at her waist and
flicked something towards Neklos; it was too small to see, but it
flamed and glowed and exploded into a burning sun that screamed and
leaped outwards, ravening at all around and clashing in furious battle
with the bizarre black point.  Before the heat and radiation could
burn us to atoms, the universe howled and tore open in a portal of
shimmering bloody light that dragged me and Suze in with arms of fire
and pain.  As we passed through, my last sight was of panic on
Neklos's face.
</p>

<p>
And then we tumbled out of the portal into the canyon in front of
Gr&#491;fhamr and I fell on my ass, dragging Suze down on top of me
before I could let go of her hand.

<em>The blurb for "One Hot Night" is:</em>
</p>
<p>
"In a society without death, Ingfred is 20 years old and has no
prospects. All the good jobs are filled by undying masters of their
craft, and it's hard to be taken seriously when you are, compared to
everyone around you, an infant.  Fortunately, he has a solution:
undergo an illegal transformation and sell the memory to The
Experiental Herald for a ridiculous sum.
</p>

<p>
There's two problems: how can Ingfred convince a powerful wizard to
risk his mage license and his freedom to help with such a crazy plan?
And, once that's done...how will Ingfred deal with the law?"
</p>
