<p>
"Ok, Loki, I've got my next question for you," I said tiredly, leaning
forward and studying him carefully.  "Now, for this I'm going to need
a map&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Damnit, Jake, I'm a god, not a cartographer!" he spat, a trace of
Georgia twang in his tone.
</p>

<p>
I sighed and fetched some blank paper from the desk.  A few moments
with a quill and I had a crude map of Flobovia, courtesy of the
geographic knowledge the Mind-Mangling Trio (minus one, now) had
spiked into my brain when I was summoned.
</p>

<p>
I grabbed one of the benches off the wall and brought it over so I
could spread out the map in front of him.  He leaned forward in
interest.
</p>

<p>
"You know that thing that you want me to find and destroy, before the
Deorsi find it?  Let's call it the MacGuffin, just for simplicity.
You said that you can't tell me where the MacGuffin is, so let's play
a game."  I drew a line down the paper, dividing "Flobovia" in half
vertically.  "The name of the game is Where Aren't I?  And, just to
close off one avenue of 'miscommunication': for purposes of my
questions, we're assuming that the map is the territory, so if I say
'is it here' I really mean 'is it in the portion of Flobovia that
corresponds to this region of the map'."  Got it?"
</p>

<p>
Loki flashed me an amused smile and nodded, giving me a 'go on'
gesture.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, let's play."  I tapped my finger on the western half of the
country as I asked, "Is it true that the MacGuffin is <em>not</em> in
this part of the country?"
</p>

<p>
The amused smile had now spread into an outright grin. The number on
the blackboard behind him erased itself and was redrawn as '14' before
he responded. "It is false that you are correct about it being true
that it's not in that part of the country."  Suddenly he was back in
full Harlequin costume, complete with mask; I was pretty sure it was
so that he could laugh at me behind the mask without it being obvious.
</p>

<p>
I nodded and drew a line horizontally through the country, tapping a
finger on the northwestern quadrant.  "Ok, am I correct that it's not
in this part of the country?"
</p>

<p>
I burned the number on the blackboard down to an '8', but pretty
quickly I had the area narrowed down to about twenty square miles. I
had considered really carefully whether it was worth it to spend the
final three or four of those questions...after all, so what if it was
two hundred square miles instead of twenty?  In the end, I decided
that yes, it was worth it; whatever this thing was, it was important
enough that a god wanted it destroyed, and the Deorsi were willing to
pull a hundred thousand soldiers, including a lot of mages and
capable-of-turning-undead clerics off the line in the middle of a war
for survival in order to find it.
</p>

<p>
"One thing, and this is <em>not</em> one of my questions; if you won't
answer it, that's fine, but I'm not paying a question for it.  Have
the Deorsi found the MacGuffin yet?  Basically, am I already in
default on our deal, or do I still have time to find it first?" I
broke off, studying him.  It was hard to tell with the mask, but I got
a sense he was debating whether or not he was going to help.  "It's in
your interest to tell me; if I have time, then I'll optimize for
searching.  If they've already found it, I'll optimize for destroying
it before they can get at it. If I know which option to go with,
you're more likely to end up with this place destroyed before the
Deorsi get their hands on it."
</p>

<p>
His eyes crinkled up in a smile again.  "They're searching in the
right area, but no, they haven't found it yet.  They'll probably trip
over it in another couple of days, three at the most."
</p>

<p>
I nodded, satisfied.  Defaulting on a deal with a god was not
something I wanted to do; I'd been sweating bullets about that.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, one last question; you told me that you wanted me to break the
stones, grind them to sand, etc.  Do I need to do that literally, or
can I use whatever methods I want as long as the place is utterly
demolished?"
</p>

<p>
The mask disappeared, so I could clearly see the divine eyebrow that
he raised.  There was a long, uncomfortable minute of him just staring
at me.  I fought to keep myself from fidgeting in nervousness, and
only succeeded in sitting still as a statue.  I'm sure it made me look
like a mouse frozen in terror while being eyed by a hawk, but it was
the best I could do.
</p>

<p>
"You may use whatever methods you like, so long as the entire place
and all of its contents are eradicated," he eventually answered, his
voice full of icy distrust.  He gave me a measuring stare for several
very long seconds, then popped like a toy balloon and was gone.  As he
went, the invisble chalk rewrote the number on the board to '7' before
that too vanished.
</p>

<p>
"Hey, no, wait, that wasn't supposed to be one of my questions!  I
didn't mean&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The world unfroze around me, and the Landguard's heads snapped around,
eyes narrowing.
</p>

<p>
"Loki was here, I'm still me, stand down!" I cried instantly.  I was
almost in time to prevent Thomas from yanking me out of my chair and
throwing me to the floor for a detailed search.
</p>

<p>
Almost.
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
I normally don't let anyone handle me like that unless they have two X
chromosomes and magnificent...eyes.  Eventually, however, it was over
and the Landguard were convinced that I was me.  With that resolved, I
was finally&mdash;finally!&mdash;able to fall into bed.  As weird as
it was having people standing guard in the room with me, I was so
tired that I was out like a light almost before my head hit the
pillow.
</p>

<p>
My dreams were strange: the opening act featured me in a theatre,
choking on smoke while the reflection of a richly-dressed corpse
laughed uproariously.  From there I got to watch Albrecht leap up on a
stage, sing opera and do a little Vaudeville soft-shoe before jumping
into a ventriliquism act and some puppet theatre.  (The puppet looked
familiar, but I couldn't place it.)  The performance was interrupted
by massive hordes of Hollywood-style zombies that broke through the
walls and chased me out of the room.  They shambled along with arms
outstretched before them and groaning "Braaaaaaaiinnnnsssss!", just
like a good stereotype should.
</p>

<p>
I raced out of the theatre and onto a dance floor crowded with Lokis,
while a band of Lokis played a rocking jazz tune in the corner.  Loki
grabbed my arm and spun me into a tango, flickering from one form to
another as we danced. I remember noticing that he was an excellent
dancer and gave a very clear lead.  I also remember noticing that I
was a girl, and thinking to myself <em>~Ah, good, I don't have to
ponder the homoerotic implications of this when I wake up...of course,
I guess I will have to consider the significance of gender-bending in
what is apparently a lucid dream given that I'm having these thoughts.
I think I'll wake up now.~</em>
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
The morning was chilly and overcast, but I had slept the exhaustion
off, and a long hot shower left me feeling upbeat and recharged.  As I
sat myself down to a big breakfast I warned Thomas that I would be
going out into the city in an hour or two.  He nodded and sent people
and ghost sparrows flying in all directions.
</p>

<p>
I was a little greedy at the trenchers and, by the time I pushed
myself back with a contented sigh, my belly was actually bulging.  I
patted it happily and basked in the simple pleasure of
'clean-warm-not-tired-not-hungry' for a bit before pushing myself to
my feet with a groan and heading outside.
</p>

<p>
We might have a sort-of peace treaty with Anundj&aring; now, but the
Landguard's protection was just as elaborate: multiple rings of
guardians, outriders going ahead of us to evacuate any areas we might
pass through, the whole nine yards.  If this continued, I was going to
forget that there actually were people in this city who weren't either
me, Suze, or paranoid paladins.
</p>

<p>
Our first stop was the Plaza of Remembrance.  The Wall of Force was
still there; fortunately, someone had been smart enough to set up
ropes to mark out where it was so that no one ran into it and either
broke their nose or sliced themselves in half. I walked around the
whole thing, eyes on the ground as I reconstructed the Deorsi's attack
of two days ago from a combination of memory and the faint remnants of
the bloodstains on the slates.
</p>

<p>
"What are you looking for?" Thomas asked, after ten or fifteen minutes
of patiently following me around.
</p>

<p>
I frowned and gestured around us.  "Something's bothering me about
this whole situation.  The Deorsi show up and start ripping through
the country.  After they've conquered a city or two they must have
detailed maps so they know where the other cities and towns are.  They
know the importance of speed, and their mass teleport ability means
they can move their entire army from anywhere to anywhere, virtually
instantly...yet, instead of splitting up and attacking everywhere at
once, they keep their army together and work their way across the
country piece by piece."
</p>

<p>
Thomas looked thoughtful, recognizing the oddity.  "They moved up the
country from south to north, sweeping back and forth as they came.
After the bombing they moved Capital City up on their priority list
and jumped straight here.  But look how their attack went&mdash;they
teleported into roughly the center of the Plaza.  Why not the edge,
where they could get into the city proper faster?  Or why not multiple
places throughout the city?"  He paused, turning in a slow circle to
survey the area, before nodding and pointing.  "Look at this.  Given
where they came in, the ziggurat blocked their ability to expand that
way, which caused backpressure and slowed down their rate of
emergence.  The Wall of Force blocked them in these directions,
slowing them down further; I'd say that slowdown was the only reason
we were able to react fast enough to bottle them up."
</p>

<p>
I was nodding excitedly myself; I didn't see the whole puzzle yet, but
I had a feeling I had just picked up a corner piece.  "They couldn't
reasonably have known about the Wall of Force, so call that luck on
our part.  But how did they know this place well enough to use it as a
teleport destination at all?  They would have needed, at the very
least, a detailed description from someone who had been here.  And if
they did, shouldn't they have known about the ziggurat and factored
that into their deployment plans?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas was frowning himself, forehead wrinkled in concentration.  Both
of us stared around; I could feel the answer nearby, but couldn't
quite grasp it.
</p>

<p>
"Franklin," I barked, turning to face the youngest member of Alpha
Squad, who had proved smart and creative before. "What's your
explanation?"
</p>

<p>
His eyes got very big and he swallowed nervously, but soldiered gamely
on.  "Perhaps their teleport spell isn't precise?  The target might
vary over a few dozen yards, so they had to pick a spot with plenty of
open ground.  Maybe they targeted the center of the Plaza but this is
where it actually came out?"
</p>

<p>
I chewed absently on my lip while I thought about that.  "Maybe, but
it doesn't feel right," I finally answered.  "Whatever that spell is,
it's got to be high level&mdash;I would expect it to be ninth, and I'd
be amazed if if was less than eighth.  A spell that high level, you
would think it would give you precise targeting."
</p>

<p>
"Also, consider the timing," Bob put in.  "Think about when they came
in: midafternoon.  Why so late?  They could have come at any time, so
why not midnight, or dawn?  The target area was small, a circle about
ten feet across, but the troops came out of it in all directions, at a
dead run.  Assume that the departure point is also a circle of the
same size; they would have had to be lined up around it, everyone
ready to sprint inwards as soon as the spell was ready.  It would have
taken time to get that organized."
</p>

<p>
By now we were all nodding.  "Yeah," I agreed slowly; he was onto
something, but I wasn't entirely buying into it.  "But they're a
highly professional army, and this has to be a standard maneuver for
them, one that they train heavily on.  So why would it take so long to
get set up?  And again, why this exact spot, where the ziggurat would
get in their way?"
</p>

<p>
Bob paced over to the arrival point, standing in the middle of it and
looking around, then up at the ziggurat.  He turned to look at the
sun, then back at the ziggurat.  His face lit up in a clear aha!
moment.  "They needed clear space, with nothing and noone in it.  For
whatever reason, they couldn't come in until midafternoon&mdash;you
bombed them a day and a half earlier, so maybe it took that long to
dig out and get ready.  They needed to use the Plaza because it has
the most free space in the city, but think what it's usually like
here&mdash;there's people all over the Plaza, walking, having picnics,
whatever.  But at four in the afternoon, this spot would be in the
shadow of the ziggurat; most people would move away, into the sunny
areas."
</p>

<p>
All of us were nodding like bobbleheads by now, caught up in the
excitement of realization.  "Of course!" I exclaimed.  "So they used
this spot as their target because it had the best chance of being
empty.  And if they knew this area well enough to know that this was
the exact spot that would most likely be free, how did they know that?
Maybe they could get some captured Flobovian to describe the Plaza for
them, and maybe they could teleport based on nothing but a
description, but how could they know precisely enough to know where
the shadow would be?  Unless&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Unless they had spies in the city, doing their targeting for them,"
Thomas concluded grimly.  "They might not even have been taking a
chance&mdash;they might have had someone physically on the Plaza,
telling them when the space was free.  And if they had spies then,
they most assuredly have them now."  He looked around and shifted a
little closer to me.
</p>

<p>
I wasn't thinking about that though: I was remembering an unnecessary
step. "Come on," I called, striding off towards Jeweler's Square with
the firm and confident step of a leader.
</p>

<p>
A leader with the navigational ability of of a brain damaged turkey.
After about ten minutes of hopeless wandering Suze got the nerve to
ask where we were headed.  When I admitted it, she helpfully took over
the guide duties&mdash;the first step of which was apparently 'turn
around and walk back the way you came.'
</p>

<p>
Ah well, at least she was polite enough to take two left turns instead
of literally retracing our steps.
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
All the shops on Jeweler's Square were closed, the people were
evacuated, and the windows were all tight shut.  There was a
substantial Landguard presence, spread out around the perimeter,
shooting watchfully professional glances in all directions.
</p>

<p>
I looked around, pacing from side to side and muttering to myself.
"Table was here...Portable Hole was over there...Thomas, what happened
to the stuff they left behind?  The table, the dishes, the Portable
Hole, whatever else?"
</p>

<p>
"I had it packed up and brought to storage in the castle, M'Lord.
Some magi were assigned to review it for anything unusual, but they
didn't find anything."  He seemed puzzled by the question.
</p>

<p>
I nodded quietly to myself, still pacing back and forth.  Finally,
having found the spot I wanted, I started walking in circles while
staring intently at the ground.  Eventually I got down on all fours,
put my head down almost to the ground and sighted across the cobbles
near where the Deorsi had stood as they departed.
</p>

<p>
After a minute of watching this strange behavior, Thomas asked "What
are you looking for, M'Lord?"  It was said in much the same tone one
might say 'So, why is it you believe that robot ducks are leaving
mangoes in your underwear drawer?'
</p>

<p>
I scraped a finger into the crevice between two cobblestones; it came
up covered in road dust and something honey-colored and glittery.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not sure, but I think I found it," I told him absently, staring
at my finger and then looking around carefully.  There wasn't much of
the honey-colored powder, but I could see traces of it throughout the
area immediately around me.  "Riddle for you Thomas: why do you have
to step backwards when you're Wishing to be transported several
hundred miles?"
</p>

<p>
There was a long, drawn-out silence as everyone looked back and forth
between us.  Finally, Thomas shrugged and patiently fed me what he
knew was a straight line.  "I don't know, M'Lord.  Why <em>do</em> you
have to step backwards when you're Wishing to be transported several
hundred miles?"
</p>

<p>
I smiled grimly, still staring at the glittery mineral dust on my
finger.  "You don't."
