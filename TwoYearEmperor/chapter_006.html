</p>

<hr />

<p>
Far, far above the earth, six figures appeared.  Three of them, human
mages all, vanished precisely six seconds later, leaving the others
gazing down at the soft blue curve of the world below.  Immediately,
the unforgiving pull of gravity reached out to pull them tightly into
its embrace.
</p>

<p>
The three figures, each a mile higher than the previous one, quickly
oriented themselves parallel to the earth and spreadeagled, as though
lying with their pot bellies on a mattress.  The lowest had a bit more
trouble than the others, flailing its stubby clay limbs and tumbling,
but it eventually mastered the trick.  The three moved into a rough
formation, the Continual Flame spells on their heads making it easy
for each to track the others, especially through the
nearly-nonexistent air at this altitude.
</p>

<p>
A cup tied to the forehead of the topmost figure dragged with it an
Arcane Eye that relayed all of this to a mage named Davis, who
repeated what he saw into the Major Image that surrounded him.  Three
dozen people watched the Image and held their breath in rapt
attention.
</p>

<p>
For something the size of a Dedicated Wright, falling from one hundred
miles above the earth takes around seven minutes.  The fall was quite
peaceful, much like resting on a featherbed.  Occasionally, the wind
sent one or another of the constructs into gut-wrenching tumbles until
they could stabilize, but it was manageable.  And always, there was
the raging rush of the wind, like an upside-down waterfall pouring
past; the sound, relayed by Davis, bounced off the walls of the the
War Room in a cacophony of echoes.
</p>

<p>
Four minutes into its fall, the lowest Wright could see the Deorsi
encampment as a splotch of color below and to one side.  Immediately,
its controlling mage angled it slightly to fall on a slant, sliding
closer to its target; the others shifted to follow.
</p>

<p>
As the distance closed, more detail could be seen.  The location of
the tents in the center of the camp, larger and more ornate than those
of the common troops, became clear.  Immediately, all three Wrights
shifted into a head-down position, slashing towards those tents like
thunderbolts.
</p>

<p>
One after another, the three homunculi unstrapped the heavy iron boxes
fastened to their chests, flipped them horizontal, and slid the side
off.  The moment the box opened, the Greater Glyph of Warding
inscribed within detonated in a soundless blast of mystic energy and
suddenly the clay figures did not fall alone.  Balanced on each metal
box was a giant block of iron, under an inch thick but yards high and
wide.  The wind grabbed the Walls of Iron in a giant hand, flipping
them upwards to tumble behind their creators.
</p>

<p>
By now, the Wrights were moving like demonic bats racing out of Hell,
and the Walls came in with the same velocity.  Within seconds, the
atmosphere around their plummeting metallic forms shredded, hiding
each of them from sight in a shockwave of plasma that lit up the night
like three small suns.
</p>

<p>
What struck the Deorsi encampment was not a series of bombs; it was
three individual cataclysms.  Each titanic strike produced a crater
nearly three hundred feet wide and over sixty feet deep, with a layer
of smashed rock and powder reaching down another thirty feet.  Much of
the powder and crushed rock blasted outwards from the craters like a
claymore mine sized for a god.  All the soldiers nearest the crater
were hit by the rock shards and blown to mulch; from there, the shards
continued their upward arc before slashing back down and slicing yet
another huge swath of Deorsi soldiers into bloody shreds.  The
powdered rock fell over everything near and far, mercifully hiding the
shredded bodies but also burying living humans and horses alive in
suffocating dust.
</p>

<p>
The blast of rock and powder was mostly fan-shaped, and therefore
missed the majority of the army.  The hurricane of air blast, however,
was circular.  A hammer blow of wind blasted out in all directions at
four hundred miles an hour, striking without warning.  The winds
picked up anything in their way&mdash;people, loose weapons, cooking pots
full of bubbling hot stew, tents, horses&mdash;and flung them into the
sky, flipping them around like clothes in a dryer before dropping
them.  Most of the army was affected; thousands died, their lungs
ruptured by the wind or their bodies smashed when they fell.  Those
who survived had broken limbs, internal bleeding, and other damage
ranging from serious to life-threatening.  Anyone caught between the
two nearby craters was hit by both airblasts and ground to paste.
</p>

<p>
The only good news from the Deorsi perspective was that these were not
nuclear strikes; there was no radiation or significant thermal bloom.
Despite that, everything inside the craters was simply
gone&mdash;including the tents of the commanders, senior magi, and
senior clerics.
</p>

<p>
Whoops of joy spread through the Flobovian War Room.  The Walls had
struck in sequence, allowing the higher Wrights to adjust their aim
before summoning their own Wall.  The first had landed just beyond the
edge of the army, killing or injuring no more than a few thousand
common troops.  A quick glance upward by the topmost Wright showed
that the third Wall was well off course&mdash;probably tumbled by a
wind gust&mdash;and was likely to miss the Deorsi encanpment entirely.
The second one, steered by sheer luck or possibly direct divine
intervention, landed square in the middle of the senior officers'
tents, wiping away the key strategic and magical resources of the
enemy like a cook wipes up a minor spill.
</p>


<p>
All this was relayed in high fidelity, Dolby surround sound, filling
the room around us as though we stood in the middle of the action.
The cheering continued for minutes with everyone, including the
normally reserved Landguard, whooping like mad.  
</p>

<p>
Personally, I felt horror at what I had done.  I bit it back though;
as Thomas had told me, it was critical to morale that I seem
brilliant, wise, and courageous.  I was pretty sure that puking on my
shoes would not seem courageous, although it certainly struck me as
wise.  I tried to look casual as I shoved my hands into my back
pockets so that no one could see how sweaty and shaky they were.
</p>

<p>
The owners of the Wrights had been wounded by the magical backlash
when their constructs were destroyed, but the Archpriest himself
healed them immediately.  Even before the healing, the wounded mages
were cheering and congratulating me on my brilliance.
</p>

<p>
Forcing myself to look calm, I turned to Duke Frederick, who was still
cradling his shattered hand by the map table.  It had been over an
hour since I had told Duncan to crush his hand; during that entire
time he had remained silent and immobile; the deep lines on his face
showing that his hand had him in agony.
</p>

<p>
Now I waved Duncan away from the Duke, who promptly collapsed.  I
bowed to the Archpriest, asking "Your Benevolence, would you please
heal Duke Frederick?"  The high priest nodded, moved to Frederick, and
murmured soft words.  The familiar golden glow&mdash;far brighter than my
own healing had been&mdash;wrapped around them both.  When it faded,
Frederick's hand was whole, with not even a bruise.  His breathing
eased and his legs lost their shakes; clearly the healing had handled
more than just the wound itself.
</p>

<p>
He looked at me, eyes narrowed and unsure.  I moved to stand by him
and held out my hand to help him up.  "Won't you join us, Your Grace?
I really would appreciate your advice."
</p>

<p>
He stared at me a moment longer, then took my hand and climbed to his
feet.  "Thank you, M'Lord.  It would be my pleasure."  His voice was
stiff with barely disguised rage, but there was some grudging respect
as well.  I supposed the respect was from the success of my bombing
tactic...as to the rage, well, I wouldn't be too happy with someone
who maimed me and then left me wallowing in pain and humiliation in
front of my peers.
</p>

<p>
I clapped him on the shoulder in the best impersonation I could manage
of a macho brotherly way; I have a feeling it was pathetic, but I'm a
whitebread geek from the suburbs, not a jock or one of those
troublemaking "rebel without a cause" types.  I turned to the map
table, one hand inviting him to join me.
</p>

<p>
Glancing at the mage waiting quietly in his chair, I requested "Davis,
please give us a map of the Deorsi's location, the Fens, and the
Maligaw."
</p>

<p>
The mage murmured words that melted from my brain the moment I heard
them and suddenly the map table surface became three dimensional,
showing the approximate features of the terrain in that area.  It
wasn't to scale and the Deorsi army was just a rough blob but it was
better than a flat depiction.  Presumably the issues were due to
Davis's unfamiliarity with the actual terrain.
</p>

<p>
I frowned unhappily at the crude map; more detail would have helped.
But, you work with what you've got.  "This first strike was succesful,
Your Grace, but I would appreciate your input on what you think the
Deorsi will do next.  I have a trap in mind, but I'm unsure where the
best place is to put it."
</p>

<p>
He looked at me and frowned.  I could almost read his thoughts&mdash;was
I seriously asking his input and showing him respect after the way I
had treated him?  I met his gaze with as open and interested a face as
I could manage, but it probably fell flat; I was far beyond the
scenarios I had prepared for, I was exhausted from a long day and the
beating Sergeant Duncan had given me, and my calm was blowing away
like confetti on the wind.  Without it, being in this room with all
eyes upon me felt like being a child dressed up in his father's
clothes to sneak into a cocktail party.
</p>

<p>
His eyes finally broke from mine and shifted down to study the
illusionary map before us.  After a moment he nodded firmly to
himself, then turned back to me.
</p>

<p>
"The Deorsi are a professional army; we eliminated the senior ranks,
but the chain of command will devolve to someone.  It's going to take
a couple of days to sort that out, find everyone, determine who's
alive and dead, dig out the troops and supplies from under all that
rock and dust and whatever else.
</p>

<p>
"Were I in command, I would guess that the attack must have been
directed from Capital City.  I would immediately detach a sizable
group, all mounted, to launch the fastest possible strike against the
City before the attack could be repeated.  Reports suggest that their
cavalry screen is about four thousand men; personally, I would
dispatch all of them, with mages and clerics in tow.
</p>

<p>
"A force that small will need substantial magical support to have any
chance of taking our defenses, so they can't afford to have their
magic drained.  They'll avoid the Fens and circle east to the Elf
Bridge.  Once they get across, they'll attempt to negotiate with the
elves for passage through the 'Hame to the Great Trade Road.  If that
can't be accomplished within a day, perhaps two, they will go west and
then north.  Most likely, they'll be here in ten or fifteen days, but
it could be faster if they use the Road."  He wound down at last,
waiting for my response.
</p>

<p>
I nodded, trying to look thoughtful and wise instead of pukey and
shaky from suppressed stress, emotion, and adrenaline drop.  "Thank
you, Your Grace.  I didn't think of them detaching a strike force.
The Maligaw it is, then.  I'll need to think on this a bit."  I gave
him a small head-bow of respect, hoping that I had the style and depth
correct to convey 'pleased executive to middle manager.'  I'm certain
I blew it, but at least I tried.
</p>

<p>
Turning to the rest of the room, I said "Ladies and
gentlemen&mdash;thank you for your help.  If you'll excuse me, it's
been a very long day and I need to bag out.  Let's pick this up
tomorrow night at sunset; have a good evening all."
</p>

<p>
I waved all the Landguard to accompany me as I made a strategic
retreat from the room.
</p>

<p>
Outside, I waited for the door to close and then sprinted for the
nearest bathroom, where I puked up everything from my hair to my
toenails.  Toilets in the ruler's castle consist of a straight shaft
leading down to a large fire elemental, so shoving your face into one
is like holding it against a space heater; nice at first, but it gets
unpleasant after a minute or two.
</p>

<p>
Oddly, Duncan was the one who came into the room with me while the
rest of the Landguard stayed outside.  He sat on the floor beside me
with a comforting hand on my back and waited for me to finish.
</p>

<p>
"S'all right lad.  Get it out; there's no shame in being sick the
first time you kill.  Everyone is."
</p>

<p>
The vomiting went on for several long, highly unpleasant minutes.  By
the time it ended, I just wanted to die.  I was shaking from the
adrenaline crash and the horror, and the taste of acid and the chunks
of half-digested food in my mouth were nearly enough to set me sicking
up again.
</p>

<p>
Duncan handed me a slab-sided drinking vessel and muttered a word
under his breath.  Immediately, it filled with water; I rinsed my
mouth gratefully, repeatedly spitting down the toilet.  From below, I
heard a yowl of crackling disgruntlement, but I just didn't care.
When I finally couldn't taste the puke anymore, I poured some of the
still-flowing water over the back of my neck, then handed the decanter
back to Duncan, who turned off the flow with another command word.
</p>

<p>
Weakly, I growled, "So help me, Duncan, if you insist on another of
your sessions before noon tomorrow, I'll order the rest of the 'Guard
to tie you up and throw you in the nearest dung heap face down."
</p>

<p>
He snorted a laugh.  "You've earned a stay of execution, M'Lord.
We'll pick it up tomorrow.  Come on, let's get you to bed."
</p>

<p>
<center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
Twenty minutes later I was sitting in the armchair in my bedroom,
unable to sleep but unable to think either.  Instead, I was staring
listlessly at Allison, who was crackling cheerily in the fireplace.
Amazingly, she was keeping her mouthy comments to herself.
</p>

<p>
Suze bumped the door open with one hip and backed into the room,
carrying a tray laden with food.  She slid the tray onto the low table
beside me and curtseyed.
</p>

<p>
"Commander Thomas said you should eat something, M'Lord," she said
diffidently.
</p>

<p>
I looked at the food apathetically; the thought of eating made me
vaguely ill.  After a moment, a realization leaked slowly into my
brain: everything on the tray was something I had eaten since coming
here, and enjoyed.  And none of it would upset a bad stomach&mdash;it was
grapes, mild cheeses, fresh breads, a light soup, and lightly spiced
warm cider.
</p>

<p>
"Did you choose this stuff, Suze?" 
</p>

<p>
She blushed and looked at her feet.  "Yes, M'Lord.  Commander Thomas
mentioned that you weren't feeling well, and I remembered you liked
these things, so I thought they might help."
</p>

<p>
"She's good at this, Jake&mdash;that's why she's the upstairs maid.
Never forget anyone's choices, do you girl?"  Allison's tone sounded
like a world-wise grandmother's&mdash;somewhere between teasing and
proud.
</p>

<p>
I had a really, really attractive idea, but I just didn't have the
energy so all I said was "Thanks, Suze, you're a lifesaver.  Have a
good night."
</p>

<p>
With a blush and a quick duck of her head, she scurried out of the
room.  That girl was sweet and kind and helpful but lordy did she need
to work on the self-confidence and assertiveness.
</p>

<p>
I snorted, a tired smile curving my lips.  Given my current
"relationship" with Sergeant Duncan, I was a fine one to talk about
the need for confidence and assertiveness.
</p>

<p>
I looked at the bed; it was deliciously warm and inviting, but I was
just too tired to climb to my feet and walk across the room, so I
settled back into my chair and closed my eyes.
</p>

<p>
I was starting to drift off to sleep when Robert stuck his head in the
room.  "I don't mean to bother you, M'Lord but I wanted to let you
know that the line of commoners you requested is well on their way.
We've recruited and dispatched just over eighteen thousand people."
</p>

<p>
I nodded and thanked him quietly.  A commoner railgun didn't actually
work as a weapons launcher&mdash;the idea that it did required mixing
rule exploits and physics in a way that simply didn't work&mdash;but
it was an incredible transportation and communication tool.
</p>

<p>
Something about the prior thought lit up a tired neuron somewhere.
Weapons launchers, weapons launchers...there was an idea in the back
of my brain, but I couldn't see the details.  I yawned and looked
longingly at the bed again, but shook it off and cudgeled my brain for
the basics of whatever this idea was.  After a minute or so, it rose
through the sludge until I could see it.  I checked the Brainopedia
again for the spells I would need.
</p>

<p>
"Hmm.  Before you go to bed, pass the word.  Tomorrow I'm going to
need a whole lot of magic&mdash;a Wall of Force, a Permanceny, and
every Wall of Iron, Fireball, Mending, Shrink Item, and electrical
spell we can scare up&mdash;Shocking Grasp, Lightning Bolt, wands,
staves, scrolls, spellcasters&mdash;whatever.  Also, about fifty
thousand copper pieces, a lot of workmen, and a bunch of carpenters
with big logs.  I need some cranes built."  I pushed myself tiredly to
my feet and trudged to the small desk in the corner.  Grabbing a piece
of parchment, I sketched on it quickly with a quill pen, then threw
the drawing away with a curse as the ink splotched everywhere.  A
couple more attempts and I finally got the hang of writing with a
feather.  I was no artist, but I managed to produce a rough sketch
with only a few stray inkblobs.  "Doesn't have to be pretty, just
really strong&mdash;needs to support a few tons.  Put 'em in whereever
the biggest open space in the city is; we're going to need a lot of
room."
</p>

<p>
Robert looked at the list puzzled.  "Are you going to try another of
those 'orbital strikes'?"
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.  "No, those only work if there's some kind of
guidance system and the target isn't moving much.  We seem to be out
of Dedicated Wrights with no way to make more in time, and I'm not
sure what we could use in place of them.  Also, the Dedicated Wrights
were a pretty crude system&mdash;the first Wall barely hit, the third
probably missed entirely, and we got lucky with the second."
</p>

<p>
I yawned and rubbed my eyes.  "Ok, I'm wiped.  I'm heading for bed;
have a good night, Robert."  He gave a polite nod and turned for the
door.  
</p>

<p>
I started to climb into bed, when there came a pointed "Ahem!" from
the fireplace.  "So following you around all day isn't embarrasing
enough, now I have to sit here all night and listen to you snore?"
</p>

<p>
I grinned sleepily.  "Go ahea&mdash;actually, hang on a moment.
Robert?"
</p>

<p>
He paused, hand on the latch, and looked back.  "Yes, M'Lord?"
</p>

<p>
"Look, I know playing courier isn't your job, but would you mind
asking around among the servants to see if anyone would be willing to
sit up tonight and keep Allison company?  In exchange, they could have
tomorrow off with full pay."
</p>

<p>
He raised an eyebrow.  "Of course, M'Lord."  And then he was gone, the
door closing quietly behind him.
</p>

<p>
If a fire can look shocked, Allison did.  After a moment though, she
got her snark back on.  "Thanks, pup.  There's hope for you yet," she
told me.  Under the snarkiness was gratitude though.
</p>

<p>
I smiled sleepily and snuggled into my big fluffy pillow.  "G'night
Allison.  You can go, and have a nice evening."
