<p>
After some long thought, I still had no idea why the Deorsi would
be behaving the way they were, so I tabled the issue.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, I don't think we have enough information to figure out what they
are searching for or why.  Back to the original question: how do we
bring their whole army to battle somewhere outside of our cities?  It
needs to be the entire army; we need to get all of them in one shot or
they'll just start resurrecting everyone we kill.  And
it <em>really</em> needs to be well away from the cities.  I'm
thinking of something that does a <em>lot</em> of collateral damage;
we definitely don't want to use it where there's anything breakable
around.  For instance, castles."
</p>

<p>
Every member of the Landguard got the same look on their face; half
"oh gods, what now?" and half "eaten alive with curiosity."  After a
long moment, they set those feelings aside and addressed the question.
</p>

<p>
Silence reigned for a long moment, then Thomas spoke up.  "Battlefield
strategy isn't really our strong point, Jake.  The Landguard haven't
had to fight a full scale battle in centuries; all of our potential
opponents are terrified of us.  We do bodyguard work, border patrol,
disaster relief, policing, and monster slaying."  He paused, frowning
slightly in thought, then continued.  "That said, if this were a
monster hunt the way to do it would be to either bait the creature to
the killing ground with something it wanted, or drive it there with
something it feared.  For most monsters the obvious answers are food
for the first, fire for the second.  I'm not sure what the equivalents
would be for the Deorsi, though.  We don't have anything to make them
run, so that's out.  As to bait...we could put some or all of the army
out there.  But they wouldn't need to send their entire army for that;
they could envelop and destroy it with only part of their forces.
Whatever we bait them with, it would have to be something that they
needed to bring their entire force to bear on...something either
really dangerous, or something really large, like another army of
about their size."
</p>

<p>
"Where they're camped now is fairly out of the way," Ethan pointed
out, his tone clipped.  "They are enveloping the town of Tor Hadrath,
with their main body camped three or four miles away from what I can
tell on the map.  There aren't any other settlements for fifteen miles
in any direction.  We can't get troops there in any real numbers, but
their main body is several miles away; it would be easy to attack them
there.  And if you need to have some people on the ground there, we
could teleport a handful in."
</p>

<p>
I nodded, slowly.  "How many people in Tor Hadrath?"
</p>

<p>
They all looked at each other to see if anyone else knew the answer.
Finally Thomas answered.  "Maybe fifty thousand?  Something like that,
anyway."  He sounded unsure, which just painted worse and worse
pictures of hundreds of thousands going down to die if I wiped out the
Deorsi army.
</p>

<p>
I paled a little.  "Is there any way we can evacuate them?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas looked at me with narrowed eyes.  "Not reasonably, no.  Like we
said, the Deorsi have put in an envelopment, with the main body of
their troops held back a few miles.  The only reason they haven't
captured the place yet is because of the truce that Albrecht gave us.
The minute the timer runs out, they'll teleport their people behind
the walls and own the place within hours.  Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, if we set off&mdash;" my brain threw up giant flashing red
lights and AWOOGAH! sirens as I suddenly realized what the Landguard
would say if I told them the plan.  Smoothly, I redirected my
sentence. "&mdash;to fight the Deorsi there, the town might suffer."
</p>

<p>
Now it wasn't just Thomas giving me the hairy eyeball, it was the
entire group.  All except for Franklin who kept looking back and forth
between me and Thomas, clearly unsure about where his loyalties should
lie.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, Allison's voice snarked out of the fireplace and
distracted us all before Thomas and friends could start ripping apart
my pitiful prevarication.  "Useless, the pack of you. Utterly
pathetic.  Big bad soldier boys, can't even figure out how to get
attacked right."
</p>

<p>
All eyes turned to her.  "Ahem.  Soldier <em>boys</em>?" asked Olivia,
the only female Landguard to survive the Deorsi teleportation attack.
She had just a trace of an accent that stretched the 'o's out and put
the emphasis on odd silly bobbles; I kept trying to figure out what it
reminded me of, and it was driving me crazy that I couldn't.
</p>

<p>
"Heh.  Fine, point for you.  Boys and girls, you're still all
useless."
</p>

<p>
I grinned, sensing that she had something for us to demonstrate just
how useless we all were and how brilliant she was.  "And you are not
useless, O self-styled Brightly Shining Mistress of the Annoying?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, duh."
</p>

<p>
I waited a beat, knowing she was going to make me ask but hoping not
to have to.  Finally I gave up with a sigh.  "And what might that be,
O Annoying One?  Congratulations on living up to your title, by the
way."
</p>

<p>
She laughed.  "Find whatever they're looking for, use that as bait.
Duh."  The fireplace echoed with the sound of a loud Bronx cheer.
</p>

<p>
Seriously, how the heck did she do that with no tongue and no lips?
</p>

<p>
"Ah, of course," I shot back, my tone as dry as dust.  "Why didn't I
think of that?  All we have to do is deduce the unknown goal of their
search, which they might not actually be conducting, from essentially
no evidence and with no real understanding of their motivations.
Ridiculously simple, I bow to your superior wisdom for coming up with
it."
</p>

<p>
"Actually, it's a pretty good idea," said the motley-clad man in the
seat next to me.  I yelped and jumped up, turning to face him.  None
of the Landguard moved.  In fact, a quick glance showed that they were
utterly still, trapped in a freeze frame moment.  Allison was equally
motionless, with a shower of sparks stuck in mid-pop. I paled and
backed away towards the door.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do calm down and have a seat.  I'm hardly about to attack you,"
said the woman sitting in the chair where the man had just been.
</p>

<p>
I stayed where I was, still poised to take off.  I wasn't
actually <em>afraid</em> of who- or whatever this was, but a
significant degree of caution seemed called for around anything that
could suddenly appear in the middle of my magically shielded bedroom
in the middle of my heavily defended castle while putting my highly
lethal bodyguard into a literal time out.  Yeah, not so much with the
reassuring.
</p>

<p>
With no perceptible change the thing in the chair looked like a five
foot tall anthropomorphic otter in Robin Hood tights, jerkin, and
feathered hat.  "Would you <em>please</em> sit down, for the love of
licorice?!" the thing grumped at me.
</p>

<p>
Slowly I took my seat; it didn't seem likely that it was going to
attack and, if it did, it seemed less likely that I could escape.
"And you are...?" I asked warily.
</p>

<p>
The two foot duck hopped up and bowed elegantly, one wing crossed over
its red sash.  "Jogan the Jocular, at your service!"  The giant fern
swayed for a moment, one frond tapping on what would have been a chin
in a person.  "Well, not actually at your service.  More like offering
a deal for services. And collecting on a deal. And not always Jogan
either.  Hm.  Maybe Wilgam the Wily?  Ooh, or Karash the Kindly?  I
always loved that name.  Those people had a great sense of humor.  Oh,
wait, I know!  How about Loki?"  A man-shaped bonfire blazed in the
chair, but the chair was not affected.  "I think that's my
name&mdash;well, one of them&mdash;back where you're from.  Or maybe
you know me as Coyote?"  Suddenly the chair held a tall, muscular man
with red-brown skin and the head of a canid.  "Sorry, it's been a
while since I was in your neighborhood; I don't remember which of my
names were best known."
</p>

<p>
I was sitting next to a god.
</p>

<p>
No, seriously.  I Was Sitting.  Next To.  A. God.  An actual, real
life god, straight out of myths and legends.  Could my life get any
weirder?
</p>

<p>
And, of course, just to add to the fun, it was a
well-known-for-being-unreliable, bargain-twisting, rules-lawyering
trickster god with a penchant for playing mean tricks.  Oh yeah, this
was gonna go great.
</p>

<p>
"Hey, I resemble that remark!" scolded the miniature turtle crawling
across the seat of the chair.  It pushed itself up on its back legs,
shaking its forelimbs at me and tsk-tsking.
</p>

<p>
"You read minds too.  Joy.  This just keeps getting better.  Ok, what
can I do for you?" I grumbled.
