<p>
By the time we walked through the city gates, my burst of enthusiasm
had worn off. Much as I had enjoyed creating magical cannon and
blowing the snot out of several acres of landscape, I was pretty
bushed.  It was late&mdash;it had been dark for hours&mdash;I was
tired, and when I tried to figure out how long it had been since
lunch, I didn't like the answer.  The stresses of the day had decided
they were all going to move in together right at the base of my skull,
get together with all of their little stress-friends, and have a giant
mosh party on my neck and shoulder muscles.
</p>

<p>
I suspect there was really cheap booze at that party.  And visits from
the police.  Possibly even from an exorcist.
</p>

<p>
About when we got back to the castle, Hunger decided that it wanted in
on the fun, and this was the time to stand up and be noticed.  Its
attention-gathering strategy went something like "<strong>Attention:
you are now out of blood sugar!  Pay me one billeeeon dollars or I
will shut down your nervous system!  Thank you!"</strong>  (Yes,
apparently, my stomach likes Michael Myers villains.  Don't ask me; I
was pretty sure I had hated those movies.)
</p>

<p>
Weak attempts at self-entertainment aside, I really was not doing
well.  This had been the day from hell and it was hitting me hard; my
brain had just been gift-wrapped in cotton wool and FedExed to tiny
little impoverished country that desperately needed to buy a vowel.  I
was starting to shake, and I was so hungry I was nauseous.  I was less
'walking', more 'trudging', and my coordination was shot.
</p>

<p>
I barely had the brainpower left to notice what was wrong, and
certainly not enough to make any choices that would be needed to fix
it.  Fortunately, I had just enough left to delegate.
</p>

<p>
"Suze, get me some food, 'k?" I mumbled, trying hard not to snarl; it
wasn't her fault that my biochemistry was making me cranky.  "Mgonna
be in th' si'ng room."
</p>

<p>
She took one look at the way I was walking and ran for the kitchens.
</p>

<center>o-o-o-o</center>

<p>
Twenty minutes later I was back in the sitting room, sprawled in my
favorite chair with my feet toasting in front of Allison's fireplace.
I was slurping some soup&mdash;chicken and something, I wasn't sure
what&mdash;and dunking bread in it, alternating slurps of the soup and
bites of the deliciously soggy bread.  On the credenza behind me was a
fine spread that the Landguard were taking turns grazing on. (Of
course, only one of them was allowed to have food occupying his hands
at a time because, hey, paranoia.)
</p>

<p>
My brain was coming back online as I got food into me; the nausea was
gone, replaced by a simple cavernous feeling.  Despite that 'there's a
hole in my middle' feeling, I made myself drink the soup at a
reasonable speed instead of slamming it down the way I wanted to.
That would just leave me feeling bloated and gross, as I knew from
past experience.  I still wanted to slam the soup, though.
</p>

<p>
Despite forcing myself to eat like a human instead of a ravenous
warthog, I polished the bread and soup off pretty quick.  Once I was
able to think again, I gave a contented sigh, straightened up and
turned to pour myself a glass from the crystal decanter on the
sideboard.  I don't know what the official Flobovian name for it was,
but I just thought of it as ohmygod-that's-good-Scotch.
</p>


<p>
"REPENT!  REPENT, O SINNER, FOR JUDGEMENT IS UPON THEE!"
</p>

<p>
I think I deserve a huge medal for keeping it to a slight startle
instead of the clinging-to-the-ceiling YIIIEEE! that was my first
choice.  Of course, I startled hard enough that most of my lovely
Scotch went flying out of my glass, ending up primarily on my shirt.
</p>

<p>
I turned around, knowing who this had to be, and found myself facing
the canonical example of the crazy religious nut: wild hair, wild
eyes, sack-like robe covered in grease stains, beatup Birkenstocks,
shaking a wooden sign at me that said "THE END IS NEAR!"
</p>

<p>
The giant gold horns curving up out of his forehead and curling back
on themselves...well, yeah, they kinda ruined the effect but hey,
what do I know?  I'm not the God of Trickery. 
</p>

<p>
I glanced around the sitting room and saw that yep, once again, time
was frozen around us.  <em>~Man, I wish I could do that,~</em> I
whinged to myself sadly, before turning back to focus on Loki.
</p>

<p>
"You realize that you are an offense to crazy people everywhere,
right?" I asked, deliberately keeping my voice calm even though my
heart was still pounding.
</p>

<p>
The robe, sign, and wild hair vanished, to be replaced with swim fins,
a wetsuit covered in Harlequin diamonds, and an inflatable yellow
rubber duck around his waist.  It was...disconcerting.
</p>

<p>
"Look at me, all fashion forward!" Loki declared, striking a heroic
pose.  A beam of sunlight came from nowhere, making his
perfectly-coiffed golden hair shine and his perfectly white teeth
gleam...although the effect was somewhat ruined by the red and green
LED lights that started chasing each other around the duck.
</p>

<p>
I sighed.  One look at my glass and I slammed what was left in it,
then turned to pour myself a refill; four fingers this time.  I had a
feeling I would need it.
</p>

<p>
"What, none for me?  I'm hurt!  No worries, no worries, I brought my
own."  When I turned back, Loki was lounging on a giant throne
straight out of a Frank Frazetta painting. He had one leg draped over
the arm and the other on the floor as he reclined against one edge of
the seat.  He wore the stereotypical (and historically inaccurate)
Viking outfit: fur tunic, shaggy fur boots, horned helmet.  A
double-bladed axe leaned against the chair in easy reach, and he had a
giant flagon of ale in his hand, the foamy head getting in his bushy
red beard as he chugged.
</p>

<p>
I sighed again and sat down, pulling my chair a little closer to him.
</p>

<p>
He let out a giant belch that went on for a good ten seconds, then
turned and sat up properly.  By the time he finished sitting up he was
wearing a pinstriped gray Armani suit, the flagon and facial hair were
gone, and the axe had morphed into a leather briefcase.  He folded his
hands, resting his elbows on the mahogany boardroom table between us.
I leaned forward too, elbows on the table and rubbing my eyes with one
hand in exasperation.  Of course this had to happen tonight.  I just
wanted to go to bed but no, I had <em>another</em> thing I still had
to deal with today.
</p>

<p>
"Let it be noted in the minutes that the party of the second part, aka
Jake the Ruler of Flobovia"&mdash;the suit was replaced by a Hawaiian
shirt, board shorts, and the tackiest sunglasses ever made.  "By the
way dude, you s'rsly need to pick a title, ya know?  Oh and like,
maybe change the name of the country!  Yeah, tha'd be epic, dude!"
The stoner look and sound was gone, replaced by a crisply dressed
brunette with a leather-backed notepad and a fancy ballpoint pen.
"Focus group testing shows that 'Jakeville' is quite popular with the
10-16 demographic, and tests well among the males 18-25 market,
although it does poorly with females in that range, and all older
demographics are ambivalent.  Now, my agency has put together some
test campaigns and we want to run them by you."  She flicked her hand
to the side like a magician pointing to the reveal; an easel appeared
with a picture of a billboard.  "Jakeville!"  she declaimed, moving
her hands to frame the picture.  "Home of the cool people!"
</p>

<p>
The executive-looking woman was gone, to be replaced by a six year old
boy who had apparently been feasting on 'Chocolate Frosted Sugary
Espresso Adrenaline Bombs!  Now With Added Methamphetamine!'  The
little pipsqueak was bouncing in his seat so fast I thought he would
vibrate into another dimension.
</p>

<p>
"Ooh, ooh, wait, I know, I know, I know!" he cried, waving his hand in
the air like he was desperate to be picked in class, or maybe was
trying to direct a plane to the right runway.  His overexcitement and
high-pitched voice felt like nails on the chalkboard of my soul, but I
tried hard to keep a friendly expression; offending gods is, as I had
learned to my pain, a disrecommended action.  "I know, I know, I know!
Jaketonia!  And you could sell Shake'n'Jake, the yummiest food on the
planet!  Oooh, yes, and you could cook it in your Easy-Jake Oven!"
The kid was gone, leaving behind only the voice of every informercial
ever: "Yes, a new country!  With a delicious dinner, <em>and</em> an
oven with your name on it!  <em>Now</em> how much would you pay?!  But
wait, there's more!  Yes, act now and we'll throw in a free copy of
'Munchkining For Dummies: Your Guide To Breaking The Universe In Nine
Easy Lessons!'  It's all yours for just $19.95 plus shipping,
handling, and the hire of a thousand bards!  Speaking of which," said
the man in the Armani suit more calmly.  "You went above and beyond,
getting ten thousand bards instead of the thousand we agreed on, and I
appreciate it."  The suit and table disappeared, leaving me to catch
myself before I could fall forward.
</p>

<p>
With (as always) no perceptible change, he was suddenly in well-worn
black jeans, a faded denim shirt, and a leather vest; a giant Bowie
knife on his hip and a black Stetson encircled with alligator teeth
completed the reference.  His chair slid forward so that he could slap
me on the shoulder. "Good on ya, mate," he announced, speaking with
the heaviest Aussie accent imaginable.  His chair immediately slid
back to its previous place, pausing on the way to do a wheelie and
spin.
</p>

<p>
"Hi Loki, nice to see you again," I started, trying really hard to
keep the tone of exasperation out of my voice.  I just wanted to go to
bed; I didn't have the energy to deal with spastic trickster gods
right now.  On the inside, I sighed longingly and took a moment to
think fondly of my lovely soft bed with the warm down comforter.  Then
I pushed it away and tried to pull ExtrovertJake out of the back of my
mind.  He muttered something about 'five more minutes, Mom' before
rolling over and pulling the covers over his head.
</p>

<p>
Great, it looked like GrouchyMe still needed to deal with this.
"Thanks for dropping by," I told Loki, forcing myself to smile.  "I
wanted to ask you about this whole thing with Albrecht and the
Deorsi."
</p>

<p>
Loki leaned back in his chair and started playing on his handheld
Nintendo console.  I heard the Pac-Man music and the iconic
'wakka-wakka-wakka' noise.
</p>

<p>
"And I would want to tell you anything because...?" It was amazing how
much teenagerishness could be jammed into nine words.
</p>

<p>
"Put the game away, would you?" I growled.  "You owe me answers to
twenty questions, and the least you could do is pay attention while
I'm asking them."
</p>

<p>
He sighed melodramatically and turned to sit straight, allowing his
legs to flop to the floor with loud clomps.  The game evaporated into
a faint shimmer of silver sparkles that vanished moments later.
</p>

<p>
"Fine, fine, whatever," he groused.  "So, let's hear it.  What do you
want to know?"
</p>

<p>
I considered carefully.  "Of all the statements Albrecht has made so
far, which ones have been untrue?"
</p>

<p>
Loki smiled and leaned back in his chair, the angstful teenage
rebelliousness vanishing to be replaced by adult connivingness.
"Well, that depends on your definition of 'truth', now doesn't it?  Do
you count things that are clearly said only as social pleasantries?  I
mean, he definitely doesn't think that the Archpriest is a 'shining
beacon in the night, guiding his flock to safety and peace', so that
was kinda a lie.  And then you get into the question of explicit
versus implicit meaning&mdash;'hello' can mean anything from 'great to
see you' to 'die in a fire' depending on your tone.  So if the
explicit and implicit disagree, is that a lie?  This is a complicated
question, Jake!  You need to clarify!"
</p>

<p>
I frowned and glared at him.  "You're quibbling.  What statements did
he make that were deliberately intended to deceive us?"
</p>

<p>
Loki tented his fingers and pulled a sour face.  "Look, I told you,
'truth' and 'lie' aren't straightforward things.  What do you mean by
'deceive'?  What about framing something in an idealized light, or
avoiding an important but unpleasant subject&mdash;are those
deceptive? If you want me to answer these questions fully and
completely, then you need to clarify."  He paused, grunted, and
offered, "Well, there was one thing that was just flat out untrue.
High Command hasn't really been sending him multiple messages a day,
and he hasn't had nearly as much paperwork as he implied."
</p>

<p>
A blackboard appeared in the air behind him and a piece of invisble
chalk wrote the number '20' on it, then scratched it out and wrote
'19'.
</p>

<p>
I frowned harder.  Really?  He gave me that half-assed weaselly answer
and then counted it against my questions?  Bastard.
</p>

<p>
Sighing, I thought carefully about what he had said, trying to tease
something useful out of it.  It seemed remarkably use-lacking; was he
just messing with me, was he being cryptically helpful, or was the
question really as difficult to answer as he claimed?  Whichever it
was, I clearly needed to frame my next questions more carefully.
</p>

<p>
"Let's look at the picture he's given us of Anundj&aring;," I began,
speaking slowly so I could mentally review each word before letting it
out.  "From what he's told us, they have a billion citizens, thirty
percent of whom are under arms.  They have the capability to use True
Resurrection at least five thousand times in two days.  They are
fighting against an enormous army of undead which they are holding
back&mdash;no, wait, let me rephrase that."  First rule of
interrogating a hostile witness: don't use compound sentences.  They
make it too easy to give cryptic or misleading answers.
"Anundj&aring; is fighting an army of undead.  As a separate
statement, they are managing to maintain their borders against the
undead, or possibly even regain ground."
</p>

<p>
I paused, thinking about what else Albrecht had said and what other
information I needed.  What was I missing?  "Ah, right.  Anundj&aring;
has some form of rejuvenation magic.  It is normal for an average
citizen to have a lifespan of more than two hundred years."
</p>

<p>
Loki was watching me with an amused expression; his throne had risen
up a couple of feet so that he could kick his legs like a little kid.
"I'm still waiting for a question...?" he put in snidely.
</p>

<p>
I reviewed all the statements I had made; it seemed to cover all the
important points.  I was well aware that I still wasn't at my best; I
was tired and still a little hungry, and I could tell I wasn't on my
game, so I tried to make up for it by meticulously thinking through
what I had said.
</p>

<p>
After several seconds of careful examination I came up with something
else.  "Oh, here we go: there are at least forty liches guiding, or
helping to guide, the armies of undead."  
</p>

<p>
I took a few more seconds to review; once I was pretty sure nothing
was missing, I continued.  "Ok, here's my question: of the statements
I just made about Anundj&aring; and the undead, which ones are false?"
</p>

<p>
Loki raised his eyebrows and then snickered.  "Way to pack multiple
questions into one, boyo; that was seven different questions and you
know it. But, ok, sure.  You were nice with the bards, I'll cut you
some slack and only charge you four."  He tipped his office chair back
on two legs and balanced there while staring up at the ceiling, lips
moving soundlessly as he reviewed what I had said.  Behind him, the
invisible chalk scratched out the '19' and replaced it with '15'.
</p>

<p>
"Let's see...<em>'they have a billion citizens, thirty percent of whom
are under arms.'</em>  Yep, it's at least thirty percent, maybe
higher.  <em>'They have the capability to use True Resurrection at
least five thousand times in two days.'</em>  True.  <em>'They are
fighting an army of undead.'</em>  True. <em>'There are at least forty
liches helping to guide that army.'</em>  True.  <em>'Anundj&aring; is
managing to maintain their borders against the undead, or possibly
even regain ground.'</em>  That one's debatable; the borders changed
some in the early part of the war, and they're still a bit fluid."  He
cocked his head in thought for a moment, then nodded decisively.
"But, yeah, overall it's a fair cop.  I don't think it's stretching
anything to say that the current borders are relatively stable."
</p>

<p>
He got up and started pacing around, stroking his long white beard in
thought.  "Hmmm.  What else?...Ah, indeed.  <em>'Anundj&aring; has
some form of rejuvenation magic.'</em>  True."
</p>

<p>
He spun on a heel and paced back towards me, still ruminating.
"<em>'It is normal for an average citizen to have a lifespan of more
than two hundred years.'</em>  You didn't specify that you meant
an <em>Anundj&aring;n</em> citizen, but I'll be a nice guy and give
you that one as a freebie. Hmm...actually, I don't know what their
average lifespan is.  I can say that I was on a recruitment drive over
there about eighty years ago and almost all the adults I met were at
least three hundred.  And let me tell you," He leaned forward, looking
at me intently and shaking one finger in emphasis.  "It is <em>really
hard</em> to get a three hundred year old man to change deities.  I
don't think I managed to net a single serious worshipper that whole
trip; it was frustrating as all get out.  I spent a decade or so on it
and then gave it up for a bad job, went looking among some barbarian
tribes.  That's way easier; you appear in a flash of fire, blow some
rocks up, give them some medicine to treat their sick, teach the men
poker and scam them out of all their stuff, and seduce all the women;
boom!  Whole new crop of worshippers, all good to go.  I
just <em>love</em> barbarian tribes.  Great people.  And surprisingly
good cooks, most of them."  His eyes got unfocused as he stared off
into the distance, lost in memory.
</p>

<p>
I had mostly tuned Loki out after he finished telling me that yes,
everything about Anundj&aring; was just as bad as I'd feared, and
there really was a giant swarm of evil undead eager to feast on my
tasty brain-meats. Now what?  As long as I was getting bad news, I
might as well get it in bulk.  What other sources of misery were still
out there...?
</p>

<p>
Oh.  Of course.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, Loki, I've got my next question for you," I said tiredly, leaning
forward and studying him carefully.  "Now, for this I'm going to need
a map...."
