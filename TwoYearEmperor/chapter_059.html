<em><strong>Author's Note</strong>:  Still don't own D&D.</em>
</p>

<hr />

<p>
"Thomas, don't do this!  I order you not to do this!" I hissed.  The
words were coming directly from my autonomic system; my cerebral
cortex knew perfectly well that it wasn't going to make a difference.
</p>

<p>
I was right, it didn't.
</p>

<p>
"I must refuse your order, Your Majesty.  This creature is simply too
dangerous," Thomas ground out.  "We cannot deal with an Evil creature
of that power level and intellect who has taken all of your
extraworldly knowledge.  This thing is not just a threat to the Land,
it is an extinction-level threat to the entire world."
</p>

<p>
Thomas turned away, focusing on the telepathic link.  <em>*I am tired
of waiting, monster,*</em> he sent.  <em>*The messages go out next
round unless you change alignment immediately.  Be advised, if you
accept the change but your knowledge or spellcasting capability has
been compromised, I will consider that an act of broken faith.  My vow
will be null and void, and the messages will be sent immediately.  You
have six seconds.*</em>
</p>

<p>
He turned back to me and spoke out loud again.  "This situation is
beyond control.  The creature has all of your knowledge, and has had
it for hours.  It also has a spell&mdash;and, presumably, so do all
the other Ice Assassins&mdash;that allows them to pass their entire
knowledgebase to each other in one round.  By now, we need to assume
that every single one of the Ice Assassins that Afi detached knows
everything that you do, and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But it gave us its word that the knowledge had <em>not</em> been
passed on!" I said, desperate to break him out of this 'certain doom'
attitude and into more of a 'hey, let's not kick off an all-out war
with the superpowerful but sorta-kinda-allied Ice Assassins just yet'
attitude.  "And we can verify that...Zone of Truth, Detect Thoughts,
lots of ways.  Besides, chances are very good that all of these things
are Lawful Evil&mdash;Afi was an emperor for hundreds of years; that's
not the act of a Chaotic being.  If it's Lawful then its word is worth
something."
</p>

<p>
Thomas shook his head firmly.  "It did <em>not</em> give us its word
that the knowledge hasn't been passed on, it asked if giving it would
be sufficient.  Even if it <em>had</em> given its word, that wouldn't
matter.  It could easily have had one of its siblings use Mindscrape
to obtain the knowledge, and simultaneously erase the awareness that
it had been Mindscraped.  At this point there is literally no way we
can tell whether or not the knowledge has gotten out.
</p>

<p>
"The best we can get out of this situation," he continued grimly, "is
a Chaotic Good Ice Assassin ally.  And, if I were in its position
right now, I would have one of the other Landguard Mindscrape my brain
empty before I went and put the Helm on.  I would have satisfied the
requirements to prevent the messages from being sent, but I would be
useless to our enemies.  Hence why I told it that I would consider
that a betrayal."

<p>
That set me back. Thomas was absolutely right, this
situation <em>was</em> completely beyond control.  The only solution
was to make sure that the Ice Assassins regarded us as useful allies,
be ready to kill them all as soon as possible and hopefully before
they killed us, and strike hard and fast against Afi himself.
</p>

<p>
Hm.  Actually, we didn't need to strike against <em>Afi</em>, did we?
He didn't even want to be fighting.  We needed to strike at the root
of the problem, Neklos.  We could either depower him enough so the
good gods could smoosh him, or we could power up the good
gods&mdash;either way would work.  Unless...was there a way to strike
directly at Neklos, instead of going after his worshippers?  Something
was tugging at the back of my brain, but I couldn't see it yet.
</p>

<p>
After a minute I shook my head to get rid of the stray thought.  It
would surface or it wouldn't, but I had other things to do right now.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, Thomas is right, we really can't contain this information," I
said to the table at large.  "Only thing I can think to do is step it
up, just blitzkrieg Af&mdash;Lichboy out of existence before he or his
little muppets can use all that info against us.  If we can take him
out and depower Deadboy enough, maybe the gods will squish any
remaining Icies for us.  Anyone got a better idea?"
</p>

<p>
We all stared at each around the table for several long seconds.
Eventually the silence was broken by Thomas, speaking over the
telepathic link.
</p>

<p>
<em>*Your time is up, monster.  I am sending the messages now.*</em>
He raised his gauntlet and tapped the stud to create the
ghost sparrow.  
</p>

<p>
Before he could give it the message, Icefi called over the
link.  <em>*All right, all right!  I'm in the canyon now, putting on
the helmet!*</em> There was a momentary pause, and then it 'spoke'
again.  <em>*There.  I'm Chaotic Good now.  Stop the messages.*</em>
</p>

<p>
Thomas spoke to his patiently-waiting ghost sparrow.  "Sending to
Healer Specialist Elaine Archer: confirm Ice Assassin alignment
change."  The sparrow vanished with a <em>pop!</em>  There was a
pregnant pause as we all waited; a few seconds later, another sparrow
appeared.
</p>

<p>
"Change confirmed: lich is Chaotic Good," the sparrow said in a
no-nonsense soprano.
</p>

<p>
Thomas nodded to himself, then lifted his gauntlet again.  "Sending to
Guardian First Kara Carter.  Confirm Elaine clear."
</p>

<p>
The response was back in moments.  "Confirmed.  Lich did not speak or
look in Elaine's direction."
</p>

<p>
I cocked my head in puzzlement.  "What was that?"
</p>

<p>
"Elaine was near the Helm to cast Detect Chaos and Detect Good," he
told me.  "Kara's job was to stay well back with a telescope and make
sure that the thing didn't just Mindscrape Elaine into believing she'd
verified its alignment."
</p>

<p>
We all digested that.
</p>

<p>
"This spell is really going to make everything suck, isn't it?" I
asked fatalistically.
</p>

<p>
Thomas shrugged.  "The Landguard spends a lot of time thinking about
how to deal with mind magic.  Welcome to our world," he said
sardonically.
</p>

<p>
I sighed, dismissed the meeting, and went to bed.
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
Right after breakfast, I took us outside again; the FLEA was about the
only good thing going on right now and I wanted to watch it some more
just for the pleasing tickle I got from knowing that we were
generating a new Archmage every six seconds just by killing worms.
</p>

<p>
...except that we weren't.
</p>

<p>
"What's going on?" I asked in confusion.
</p>

<p>
"Execute!" cried the mage leading the action.
</p>

<p>
"Polymorph Any Object: Pebble to Gray Linnorm!" cried eight of the
magi standing on the casting platform.  Eight enormous and vaguely
draconic horrors sprouted into existence: long, sleek, snake-like
bodies with two arm-like forelegs and a wicked stinger on the tail,
all of it covered in shimmery gray scales that ranged in size from
'serving platter' to 'pinky nail'.
</p>

<p>
"GRRAAWWWWRRRRR!!!!" cried the Gray Linnorms.
</p>

<p>
"Shrinken!" cried the first level mage.
</p>

<p>
"Grawwrrrrr?!??!! Urk!" cried the Gray Linnorms as they died on the
infinitely sharp blades of the Wall of Force.
</p>

<p>
"YESSSS!" cried the newly promoted Archmage.
</p>

<p>
"Embiggen!" cried Franklin, still standing there patiently with his
ten foot pole.  (Had he slept?  I hoped so.)
</p>

<p>
"What just happened?" I asked in confusion.
</p>

<p>
One of the magi noticed me standing there in bafflement and came
trotting over.  He was a young elf who, amazingly, was not ethereally
pretty and delicate-featured.  He was, in point of fact, round-faced,
quite plump, and had bad skin.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Your Majesty!  This is brilliant!" he gushed.  "So much
more efficient than reading moldy old books in the academy archives
for fifty years, and so much more comfortable than trawling through
dungeons, I'm so glad I took your offer to come here; it's totally
been worth the Geas!"
</p>

<p>
"Uh...you're welcome?"  I responded distractedly.  I was too busy
staring at the process that was still continuing. There was a steady
line of low-level people waiting to level up; the line started
somewhere off down the canyon, wound its way up to the base of the
platform, up the ladder, and onto the active position at the top.  A
Landguard sergeant was standing next to Franklin, rousting all the
newly promoted magi across the platform and down the ladder on the far
side instead of allowing them to sit down and start filling in their
spellbooks on the spot.
</p>

<p>
"What's with the change?" I asked, waving at the latest batch of
decidedly non-fire giant monsters.  "Also, who are you?"
</p>

<p>
His face split in a happy smile.  "Mage Cullen, Your Majesty!  Well,
Archmage now, and Cullen's not my real name, of course, it's just what
I go by; elvish pronunciation is a bother for non-elves, especially
the sibillant dipthongs like&mdash;" he noticed my pained expression
and cut himself off.  "Right, sorry.  Anyway, uhm...right, the
changes."  He had been fumbling a bit, trying to find his place in the
conversation.  Now he had it, and the words came out like squeeing
from an ADHD fanboy with a nose full of cocaine.
</p>

<p>
"We were working along with the worms and the fire giants," he began,
talking so fast I was having trouble understanding.  "But then we
realized that we didn't need the worms, because we could just as
easily use Polymorph Any Object on pebbles, so we did that. Then I
started thinking about my research project for my graduate
thesis&mdash;I'm studying the changes in the metabolisms of magical
creatures on a long-term time scale, so I've been doing a lot of
research about monsters from earlier eras, and that reminded me of the
Linnorms which are a precursor to dragonkind and then I realized that
Polymorph Any Object can create Gray Linnorms which are much more
powerful than fire giants so they'd give more experience meaning we
wouldn't need as many per iteration which is great because it lets us
use our magic eight hundred and fifty percent more efficiently and
then someone else suggested that we didn't need to keep the promotions
restricted to wizard so we didn't."  He beamed happily at me.
</p>

<p>
I'd had a little trouble following that verbal skid, but the general
sense had sunk in.  "So, if the graduates aren't just wizards, what
are they?" I asked, striving for a pleasant tone.  My id was feeling
possessive of the FLEA and growling at whoever had dared to change it
without asking me first, thereby making me less important and
denigrating my genius by demonstrating that it could be improved on.
</p>

<p>
The majority of me told that part of me to shut the hell up.  We
needed all the efficiency we could get, and I was awesome for having
surrounded myself with people smart enough to improve on my ideas and
gutsy enough to do it without needing to ask permission. That was
definitely the 'corporate culture' that I wanted to encourage so shut
up, wounded pride.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's the great part!" Cullen-the-hyperactive gushed.  "Now
everyone is getting twenty levels in wizard, twenty in cleric of
Herr&uacute;n, and twenty in archivist.  The wizard gives good spell
slots and skills, the archivist gives access to every divine spell in
existence which actually covers most of the wizard spells too once you
start going through the various domain spells, and the cleric is there
because it gives good combat abilities but mostly because we figure
that having direct worshippers will help strengthen the Lady,
especially if they're all Archpriests.  Oh, and could we borrow your
Eternal Hourglass so that we can set up a few more FLEAs down the
canyon, because it would really speed things up and I estimate that if
we had ten of them we could use all available instances of the
Polymorph Any Object spell in an hour and then once the new graduates
have had time to sleep we can start getting it running again and
that's going to go a lot faster since Sergeant Thorn had his
brainwave!"  He waved at the Landguard sergeant on the platform, who
was currently physically manhandling a distracted young wizard out of
the way so that the line could keep moving.  "He pointed out that the
Landguard have Fortifying Bedrolls as part of their standard gear and
that with a Bedroll a mage only needs to sleep for one hour instead of
eight before they can rememorize spells so we've already requisitioned
all of the Bedrolls so that we can optimize the throughput on the FLEA
and I just wish there were more because there's only three hundred and
fifty two and that's enough to manage the current throughput but once
we set up more FLEAs it won't keep up so we really need to find a way
to get some more."

<p>
I stared at him.  Then at the platform where the latest batch of
snaky-dragony-things were plunging to their doom.  Then at him.  All
of the questions I wanted to ask collided in my brain so that none of
them could fit through my mouth for a moment.
</p>

<p>
Evetually, I managed to get the traffic jam sorted out and let one of
the questions out.  "Eight Linnorms is enough to give someone sixty
levels?" I asked.  It wasn't the most important question, but it was
the first one to get down the offramp from my brain.
</p>

<p>
He nodded so hard that I thought his head would fall off.  "If they
start at first level, yep!  We thought about adding a couple more to
pick up a few levels in rogue to give people some stealth abilities
for when you let us go in to fight the bad guys, but after some
discussion it was decided that that wasn't a critical component since
the sneak attack damage is neglible compared to&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Right, thanks Cullen," I said, quickly cutting off the flood.  "Next
question: what the hell is an archivist?"
</p>

<p>
He didn't seem at all offended by having me talk over him; I had a
feeling it was a common occurrence for him.  "Oh, archivists are very
interesting, Your Majesty!  They aren't very common...most temples
frown on them a bit, because they use the powers of proper clerics
without actually devoting themselves to a god, which really isn't fair
if you ask me but it doesn't really matter that much because they're
great in a combat situation since they can get all the cleric and
paladin spells, which are all divine of course, but they can also get
most wizard spells by going through the various cleric domains which
makes them seriously overpowered especially since they synergize really
well with wizard levels since archivists are based off of Intelligence
like a wizard instead of Wisdom like a cleric, which really makes more
sense if you ask me because they work more like wizards where they
cast divine spells like a cleric but they don't pray for their spells
they have a prayer book&mdash;which is basically just a spellbook but
of course they have to come up with their own name for it&mdash;and
they find or buy divine spells and write them in the prayer book and
then every day they can memorize whatever spells they want from the
prayer book just like wizards memorizing from their spellbook and
that's pretty great because they have such a wide variety but also
awkward because there aren't nearly as many divine scrolls around as
arcane ones and archivists need to have lots of divine scrolls in
order to get a full load of spells and so I was thinking about that
and I had some ideas about maybe putting together a library for divine
magic much like the arcane magic repository in the Imperial Library
and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty, you have a meeting in fifteen minutes, starting in the
war room," Suze interjected.  "Perhaps you should loan Master Cullen
the Hourglass and then we might want to start heading back?"
</p>

<p>
I turned to Suze in hopefully-concealed relief.  "Ah!  Yes, the
meeting!  Right, thanks for the reminder, Suze."  I turned back to
Cullen, grabbed the Hourglass out of my pocket and forced it into his
left hand, then pumped his right quickly and repeatedly with a big
(hopefully not too obviously fake) smile plastered on my face.
</p>

<p>
"Cullen, thank you so much for the information," I told him, speaking
quickly so he couldn't jump in.  "Great job here, keep it up.  Oh, and
make sure that all of the Flobovian magi get run through too&mdash;do
Isaac and Reynard next, if you would.  And once you've done all of the
current magi, start running all of the general population
through. Can't have enough massively overpowered casters, after all!
Thanks again and don't forget to get the Hourglass back to me when
you're done with it, ok gotta run!"  With a last firm shake of his
hand, I made my escape.
</p>

<p>
Once we were a few dozen yards away, I turned to my wonderful personal
assistant.  "<em>Thank you</em>, Suze," I told her with heartfelt
gratitude.  "Good lord, it was like being buried under a verbal
avalanche!  I appreciate the rescue."
</p>

<p>
She smiled, blushing slightly.  "You're welcome, M'Lord.  Actually,
there really is a meeting, but not for an hour.  Strategos Albrecht
wants to discuss what to do with the new convert, as well as reviewing
the effects of the recent strikes against the enemy and planning the
next set.  Also, Master High Priestess Drifa and Master High Mage Unn
want to talk about how to incorporate these new high-level people into
the city's hierarchy."
</p>

<p>
I groaned quietly to myself.  Meetings.  Lovely.  Best of all, it
sounded like everyone had an axe to grind.  Oh yeah, this was going to
be mountains of joyful song and smiles.
</p>

<p>
"Fine, meetings, hurrah," I grumbled.  "Well, let's get some food and
then get it over with."  A pause, and then a thought occurred to me.
"Oh, and get me a detailed rundown on archivists, would you please?
Also, ask Reynard and Isaac what classes they put in my download and
get details on any others that might exist.  Have them coordinate with
one of the Gr&#491;fhamrites in case there are some over here that we
don't have in Flobovia."
</p>

<p>
Suze nodded, fingers twitching as she wrote a mental note to herself,
and then we continued hurrying back to Gr&#491;fhamr for the joy of
sitting and talking.  Swear to Flying Spaghetti Monster, if this
continued being my day-to-day, then the strongest muscle in my body
was going to be my butt.
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
"Ok, so, to sum up," I said, gesturing with both hands as we strode
through the corridors in our now-standard anti-god-scrying measure.
"Albrecht and Thomas, by tomorrow morning you're going to have talked
with Icefi and see what we can get from him.  Unn and Drifa, you're on
top of integrating the newbies into a combined form of your existing
hierarchy.  You'll have a report on that for lunchtime tomorrow, yes?"
I waited for their nods and then continued.  "Ok, anything left that
we need to cover before we start talking about how to blow the enemy
into giblets?"
</p>

<p>
Colborn grimaced, looking a bit awkward.  "I'm supposed to report in
to Hammond today.  How do we want to handle that?"  He took care to
split the words across several corridor segments.
</p>

<p>
"Will you be reporting to him personally?" Albrecht asked with
interest.
</p>

<p>
Colborn nodded.  "Yes; I'm his strongest mage, so he uses me as a
personal enforcer."  His fangs flashed in a quick smile.  "There have
been far fewer disciplinary issues since he put me in that position."
</p>

<p>
Isaac sniffed.  "<em>His</em> strongest mage, perhaps," Isaac said
with a pretending-to-be-joking-but-really-I'm-not tone.  I glanced at
him wryly; he was clearly feeling his new sixtieth-level oats&mdash;he
had opted for sorceror levels instead of cleric, much to my
carefully-concealed delight.  His dislike for clerics and their
'powers that are just <em>given</em> to them' trumped his desire for
extra power of his own, and that thrilled my god-hating little soul to
no end.  Not that it mattered much, since his new archivist levels let
him cast all the divine spells without needing to deal with the
messiness of actual worship...well, it would, once he had them written
into his prayerbook.  That was actually something of a sticking point
at the moment; there weren't nearly enough divine scrolls around.
</p>

<p>
All that aside, Isaac was a very sane person and, like every sane
person, he wasn't too fond of Colborn.  Somehow, I really couldn't
bring myself to smack him for it; I was still having trouble dealing
with Colborn's attitude my own self.
</p>

<p>
"Hammond's strongest mage, hm?" Allison snorted.  "Guess the others
aren't that impressive then, because your mightiness sure worked well
for you when you and Jake decided to play whack-a-mole with Afi's
Legion.  Pretty hilarious from what I've been told&mdash;big bad
Archmage like you versus a couple close-combat experts and a guy with
no levels.  Tell me, how exactly do you fit that ego through the
corridors?  I mean, they aren't that big&mdash;are you using a lot of
Grease spells?  If so, you might want to try&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"This sounds like an opportunity," Thomas said, steamrollering right
over Allison's obnoxiousness.  "If Colborn can get us inside Hammond's
defenses, we could capture him, maybe even get his alignment changed
with one of the Helms.  Even if he is one of the weakest Lich Kings,
he'd be quite an asset if we could bring him over."
</p>

<p>
Colborn snorted.  "He's a Lich King.  He's seven hundred years old, a
twenty-eighth level wizard, and he's been a lich for three hundred
years.  He's dealt with hundreds of attacks, ranging from the
pointy-stick types up to serious threats like dragons and other
wizards.  How would <em>you</em> take him out?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas, Commander of the highly elite and highly lethal Landguard,
stopped walking.  He leaned casually against the wall and gazed at
Colborn calmly.  His expression was completely blank.  He wasn't
making any aggresive moves; he was, in fact, leaning back against the
wall in a very non-combat position, arms folded across his
chest. Despite that, there was a palpable aura of menace around him as
he stared at Colborn.
</p>

<p>
Thomas's fingers drummed once, <em>ra-ta-ta-ta</em>.
Pause.  <em>ra-ta-ta-ta</em>.
</p>

<p>
After a few long seconds of this, Colborn gaze flicked down to the
hilts of the swords that Thomas had used to effortlessly cut Afi's Ice
Assassin into giblets.  The 'un' started to wear off of Colborn's
'ruffled'.
</p>

<p>
<em>ra-ta-ta-ta.</em>
</p>

<p>
Colborn shifted his weight uncomfortably; I had a feeling he'd just
remembered how three of the junior Landguard had beaten him senseless
and forcibly converted him to the side of Good.
</p>

<p>
<em>ra-ta-ta-ta.</em>
</p>

<p>
Colborn's eyes roved around the people in our group, noticing the
oh-so-very-casual stance of Alpha Squad's rather hulking members as
they loomed on either side of us in the very tight quarters of the
Gr&#491;fhamr corridors. The corridors which
were <em>sufficiently</em> tight that Alpha Squad's magic-eating
swords were within reach of Colborn's undead hide without Alpha Squad
having to so much as take a step.
</p>

<p>
<em>ra-ta-ta-ta.</em>
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I mean," Colborn stumbled, trying to smooth over his blunder.
"Do you think you would attack with weapons and kill him, or try to
beat him unconscious the way you did with me?  Because if you use
weapons, he'll just regenerate at his phylactery after you kill him."
</p>

<p>
<em>ra-ta-ta-ta.</em>
</p>

<p>
Undead have no biological functions. It is not possible for them to
sweat, or to involuntarily gulp.  Likewise fear cannot make them look
green or pale.  Nonetheless, I'm sure that Colborn would have been
showing all of those symptoms had he still been alive.
</p>

<p>
The fingers finally stopped drumming and Thomas twitched one shoulder
to push himself upright.  He quietly turned and started pacing down
the corridor again, pulling the rest of us into motion with him.
</p>

<p>
"I would say that we capture him," Thomas said calmly.  "Put him under
an anti-magic field, knock him unconscious as we did with you, convert
him."
</p>

<p>
"He'll be better prepared than Colborn was," Reynard put in.  "I
suspect he's more...<em>defensively minded</em> than our Master High
Mage."  He nodded politely to Colborn.
</p>

<p>
Colborn may have been smart, but he was socially clueless enough to
completely miss the fact that Reynard had just called him an arrogant
and unprepared idiot.  He actually smiled at Reynard and gave a
pleased nod, as though he'd been complimented.  Maybe he thought
Reynard was impugning Hammond's courage as compared to Colborn's?  It
was hard to figure.
</p>

<p>
"You'll have to go inside his lair to take him down.  If anything goes
wrong, you won't have a line of retreat," I put in.
</p>

<p>
"Also, he may consider me a trusted lieutenant, but he still doesn't
allow me anywhere near him," Colborn offered.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht frowned.  "How does he communicate with you, then?"
</p>

<p>
"He has an audience chamber," Colborn explained.  "Whenever someone
shows up to talk to him, he speaks through a projection while he
himself is off somewhere in the depths of the maze that leads out of
the audience chamber.  The whole place is Dimension Locked, so you
can't teleport into it.  He had me bring some spell components in a
couple of times, so I know there's a lab in there, but I didn't see
anything else except a lot of corridors.  I don't even know how big
the maze is.  I do know that there's a lot of traps though, and they
were different and in different places both times I was in there."
</p>

<p>
"What kind of traps?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
He shrugged.  "Explosive Runes.  Illusionary walls.  Monster summoning
traps.  Straight up blaster traps&mdash;Lightning Bolt or Fireball,
mostly.  One of them was an entire series of Manyjaws
spells&mdash;thirty or forty of them, all summoning ten jaws each.
Anything going through there would be ripped to shreds instantly."
</p>

<p>
Thomas raised an eyebrow in interest.  "So, all magical traps?"
</p>

<p>
Colborn shrugged but nodded.  "As far as I saw.  He doesn't let many
people back into the maze, so he might not have wanted to let a
trapbuilder in to build physical traps.  He prefers to handle the
defenses himself...although it wouldn't surprise me if there were some
physical traps; he's pretty paranoid."
</p>

<p>
He paused for a moment and then continued quickly as he remembered
something.  "Oh and, of course, he's got Guards and Wards all over the
place, so expect alarms and fog and webs and Suggestions and confusion
spells everywhere.  And don't forget about the various swarms of
golems and nonsentient undead that are guarding various parts of it."
He paused for a moment, then hastened to add "Oh, and he has a
menagerie of monsters in there too.  I know there's a couple of
beholders, some rust monsters, some disenchanter beasts, some
basilisks...probably other things."
</p>

<p>
"Hmm," said Thomas thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"That...seems challenging," Albrecht said slowly.  "He's somewhere in
a maze of unknown size and layout, which is riddled with unknown
magical and probably physical traps.  He's got an unknown but large
number of powerful guards, many of which are optimized for defeating
physical attackers."
</p>

<p>
Thomas shook his head absently.  "Not a problem; we could deal with
everything Colborn just mentioned.  Mage defense will make the
beholders ineffective and take the sting out of most of the rest. We
can prepare for the disenchanters and rust monsters; have some 'Guards
outfitted in silk suits and let them screen for the rest of us. Any
doors we come to, we can probably smash them open&mdash;we'll bring
portable rams in our packs.  We'd lose some people in the process, but
that would be an acceptable price to convert a Lich King.

<p>
"There's two problems," he continued thoughtfully, ticking off his
index finger.  "If we <em>did</em> capture Hammond, how would we
contain him long enough to get him out?  We would need to have mage
defense up in order to contain him, and while we're doing that we
can't teleport out or put him in a Portable Hole.  We could beat him
unconscious, but even so I wouldn't be comfortable dropping the mage
defense until he was completely neutralized.
</p>

<p>
"Second problem," he said, ticking off his second finger, "is that by
the time we could get to Hammond he would either be gone, or would
have had the time to analyze our strengths and prepare defenses that
actually <em>could</em> stop us."
</p>

<p>
Reynard quirked his lips in a sardonic smile.  "What's this?  Is the
great Landguard Commander admitting that there is something his men
can't deal with?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas flashed him a sardonic smile.  "Of course there is.  There's no
such thing as an unbeatable opponent, and that certainly includes the
Landguard.  We aren't invincible by any means...just very, very
tough."
</p>

<p>
Isaac and Reynard chuckled.  Colborn looked like he'd bitten a lemon,
but he was smart enough not to say anything.  I was too busy thinking
to pay much attention.
</p>

<p>
"I...might have some ideas on how to help with that," I said slowly.
"First step, though, is to get the Landguard through the FLEA.  You
guys are too useful to have you lagging behind everyone else in
power."
</p>

<p>
Thomas snorted.  "Already done.  I rotated all of us through last
night, while you were asleep.  We're all
paladin/wizard/sorceror/cleric of the True God/archivists now;
twenty-first in paladin and twentieth in everything else."
</p>

<p>
Everyone at the table blinked at that.
</p>

<p>
"Doesn't being a sorceror require having some sort of magical
bloodline&mdash;dragon, celestial, something like that...?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
He shrugged.  "Of course.  And now we all have such bloodlines, since
we took levels in sorceror."
</p>

<p>
Everyone looked at me in curiosity as to why I would ask such a stupid
question.  I sighed.
</p>

<p>
Thomas rolled right on by my foolishness.  "Also, I've got every
Landguard who isn't on duty scribing divine scrolls so that we can
load up our prayerbooks," he continued.  Turning, he gave Drifa a
polite nod. "I also put a couple thousand of the city's regular
clerics on that; I hope you don't mind, Master High Priestess.  Those
spells will of course be handed to all of the new archivists as well,
so it's for the entire city."  Drifa shrugged with a relaxed smile;
Thomas smiled back, looking grateful.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's...exciting," I said, still a bit flummoxed.  "Ok, let's
walk through this.  Hammond lets Colborn through into his audience
hall.  Colborn sneaks the Landguard in.  The Landguard need to get
through the maze and all its defenses, find Hammond, capture him, and
extract all of them.  That about right?"
</p>

<p>
There were serious and rather daunted nods all around the table.
</p>

<p>
"Thomas, you said that you could deal with the defenses, right?" I
verified.  "The problem is that the maze will take too much time?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas nodded.  "Yes, and also how to get us all into Hammond's base
in the first place.  There are three hundred and fifty two Landguard
still alive; I would not undertake this mission with fewer than two
hundred of us, and two fifty would be better.  Getting that many
people into Hammond's base without being noticed seems tricky...also,
I'm a little uncomfortable leaving such a small guard here; our
primary mission at the moment is to protect you, Jake, since you're
the best force multiplier we have in order to protect the Land."
</p>

<p>
I smiled.  "I am very onboard with that mission.  In fact, I think
it's an utterly brilliant mission, and I wholeheartedly endorse it.
That said, I can solve all of these problems; the 'leaving enough of a
force behind' problem, the 'getting you in to the lair' problem, and
the 'getting you through the maze quickly' problem."
</p>

<p>
That got me a bunch of raised eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
I smiled smugly.  I know that smugness is unattractive and bogarting
the limelight is annoying, and normally I really did try not to do
either one...but sometimes they were just <em>so</em> much fun.
</p>

<p>
"First off, let's rebuild the Landguard numbers," I said.  "Three
hundred and fifty two of you guys is not enough, and I like the idea
of you leaving a large presence behind."
</p>

<p>
Drifa frowned.  "Your Majesty, we discussed this.  Resurrections are
very dangerous right now; we assigned seven magi and six clerics to
deal with the soul rider that came back on Archmage Isaac.  Eight of
the casters required significant healing, three of them required Break
Enchantment or Remove Curse spells, and two of the magi were killed,
meaning the whole thing was a net wash."  She flicked a glance at
Isaac and Reynard and her lips pursed in irritation.  Presumably,
she'd known the magi who'd been killed, so their deaths seemed more
important than recovering Isaac and Reynard.  To me it was the other
way around; the ancestral brain machinery is funny that way.
</p>

<p>
I shook my head, forcing a somber expression in respect for Drifa's
lost friends.  "Nope, no resurrections.  Thomas, have all of the
Landguard start casting Ice Assassins, then give them the same orders
that Afi gave his&mdash;always work in the creator's best interest,
never harm him or allow him to be harmed, always act as exemplary
Landguard, etc. By the end of the day, I expect to see at least twelve
hundred Landguard kicking around."  Something occurred to me and I
hastened to add, "Oh, and make them all wear numbers so that I know
which Thomas I'm talking to."
</p>

<p>
"Huh," said Thomas.  And then he dispatched a Sending.
</p>

<p>
"By the same token, get all the new non-Landguard Archmagi doing the
same thing," I added.  "It's a faster way to build our numbers than
the FLEA, and it gives a lot more people who can scribe scrolls to
fill the prayerbooks.  Oh, and also have them use Wish to get more
Fortifying Bedrolls, and to get the standard gear for the Landguard in
order to outfit the new versions."
</p>

<p>
Thomas nodded and dispatched a Sending.  "All right.  Although,
burning up all that experience on Wish and Ice Assassin will mean
we'll have to feed people back through the FLEA, which will take up
slots that could be used getting other people ramped up, making it
less efficient.  That's manageable, though.  What about the rest of
it?"
</p>

<p>
"As to containing Hammond, you take some fenfrogs in with you and they
lick the magic out of him.  The maze is the easy part; you just use
the right hand rule.  Put your right hand on the wall and don't let go
as you walk through.  Assuming it's a one level maze, you'll pass
through every part of it and eventually find the exit."
</p>

<p>
Everyone's eyes flicked up to the ceiling and their fingers twiddled a
bit as they thought their way through that one.  Slow nods and
expressions of surprise showed as they all got it.
</p>

<p>
"Now, as to how we get you through the maze quickly enough to surprise
Hammond...that one is going to be <em>hilarious.</em>  I just hope you
guys like each other a lot."
</p>

<p>
That got me a suspicious look, which I happily ignored while giggling
maniacally to myself.  I wasn't about to satisfy their curiosity just
yet.  The whole 'dramatic reveal' thing was just too much fun...by
which, of course, I really meant 'too satisfying to my ego.'
</p>

<p>
Hey, we all have our faults, ok?  
</p>

<p>
I quickly shifted the topic before they could press for details.
"Before we get into that, though, there's something we need to take
care of."
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
"Arros, God of Magic, Lord of Wizards, Supreme Archmage and Master of
Mystics, Grand High Poobah of Magicdom, Coolest Banana of the
Mystically Badass Bunch, please grant us the tremendous honor of your
presence!" I called out, pouring a few drops of Cire Perdue on the
hastily improvised altar to His Magical Mightiness while carefully
holding my nose so as to avoid adding vomit to the offering.  I wasn't
too clear on this whole 'talking to gods' thing, but I was pretty sure
that vomit was an unwelcome offering.
</p>

<p>
Standing behind me, Drifa looked absolutely horrified at my departure
from scripture.  So did Isaac and Reynard and...ok, basically
everyone.  Except Allison, of course.  She was snickering fit to beat
the band.
</p>

<p>
"Well <em>that</em> was unusual," Arros said with a smile.  "Don't
think I've ever heard some of those epithets before.  Not sure how I
feel about being called a fruit."
</p>

<p>
I strangled a laugh at that one; I was pretty sure he didn't know the
idiom, and I certainly wasn't about to explain it to him.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks for coming, good to see you again," I told him, striving for
'casual yet respectful.'  I think I probably got something more like
'inappropriately chummy' but at least His Magicness hadn't obliterated
me in a flash of divine temper, so I was going to call it a win.
</p>

<p>
"I was just sitting down to lunch; would you care for a bite?" Arros
asked, producing a full high tea from some extradimensional
hyperspatial tesseract pocket that I wasn't going to think about
because I was <em>so</em> tired of this world's casual physics
breaking.  (And why <em>that</em> was the thing I had trouble with,
given that I was busy having a conversation with a physical god, I
don't know.)
</p>

<p>
"That would be lovely, thanks," I said, sitting down very gingerly in
the chair that he conjured for me.  It looked like a giant soap bubble
and, as I sat on it, it conformed perfectly to my body.  I had a
sneaking suspicion that Arros had been hanging out with Loki lately,
because this seemed much more the Trickster's brand of wacky fun.
</p>

<p>
Arros lifted up the cover of a serving dish to display a
perfectly-arranged plate: soft boiled egg in the half shell in the
center, surrounded by butter-soaked toast, sauteed mushrooms, and
fried tomatoes.  He set it carefully in front of me and then took one
of his own.
</p>

<p>
I felt amazingly uncomfortable eating while the Landguard and the rest
stood behind me watching, but I wasn't about to poke my host about it;
I was here to ask a favor, and implying that someone was being rude is
not conducive to favor-getting.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, Arros was actually quite mannerly.  Once he and I were
served, he looked up at the others and gestured for them to sit.  The
table obligingly expanded to make room, and new chairs popped out of
nowhere.  "Well?" he demanded.  "Aren't you going to join us?"
</p>

<p>
Drifa, Unn, Isaac, Reynard, and Albrecht sat promptly.  Colborn was a
bit more hesitant about sitting at a breakfast table when he couldn't
eat, but he did take a seat.  Thomas gave Alpha Squad a speaking look
and then joined us; the four of them stayed on their feet.
</p>

<p>
Arros raised an eyebrow in amusement.  "Don't worry, Commander.  I
guarantee the safety of everyone here.  Your men may feel free to have
some lunch."
</p>

<p>
They were clearly reluctant, but they did sit down and allow
themselves to be served.  Just as well; it's not every day that the
God of Magic serves you an English breakfast for lunch with his own
hands while you're sitting in the middle of a magically created
mansion in the middle of a city made of Portable Holes.  It would be a
hella story to tell the grandkids.
</p>

<p>
"So, what can I do for you, Jake?" Arros inquired, dunking strips of
toast in his egg and nibbling on them daintily.
</p>

<p>
"It's about the Edict, actually," I said, forking up a couple of the
mushrooms.  (Unsurprisingly, they were simply divine.)  "We're in a
war for survival here and, let's face it, we're heavily outmatched.  I
need to be able to munchkin without crossing any lines that are going
to get me smacked, and right now I don't know where those lines are.
Can I get a copy of this thing?"
</p>

<p>
Arros hmm'd and chewed his mushrooms quietly.  He paused, conjured a
glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice (one appeared in front of each of
us) and sipped it thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"The Edict is a bit...fluid," he said slowly.  "It boils down to
'don't do anything that might let you ascend,' but the list of things
that fit under that umbrella is pretty broad, and it gets longer every
time you mortals come up with some new overly creative idea."
</p>

<p>
I sighed in exasperation, and paused to step on my temper.  Showing
how irritated I was by this was not conducive to getting what I
wanted.  "I can understand that," I said, nodding soberly.  "Would it
be good enough if I promised that I have not the slightest interest in
ascending and, even if I <em>did</em> find a way to do it, I wouldn't
use it?  Seriously, all I want to do is win this war and avoid dying
until I can go home."
</p>

<p>
Arros flicked a glance at Thomas and the Archmagi, pursing his lips.
After a moment he gave a tiny shrug and shook his head slightly as
though discarding a thought.
</p>

<p>
"Not really," he said.  "Even if <em>you</em> didn't use an idea to
ascend, someone else would.  We tried doing the case-by-case thing for
a few hundred years and it worked poorly, so now we've got a
zero-tolerance policy."  He paused for another bite of toast.  "That
said, whoever responds to the issue has wide latitude on how they deal
with it.  The first time you broke the Edict, you did it in Ilara's
temple, so she was the one who responded.  She's a pretty serious
person, so she tends to take a fairly hard-line stance.
</p>

<p>
"On the other hand, when you started buying huge numbers of spells,
that was in my portfolio, so I was the one who responded.  Given that
it was a second offense, I <em>had</em> intended to erase you from
existence, but you made me laugh so I decided to give you a warning
instead."  He delicately sliced a tomato in half and took a bite.
</p>

<p>
I shivered at the casual declaration of how close I'd been to being
annihilated.  Let's hear it for temper tantrums that happened to
tickle the divine funnybone!  My hands felt clammy and were shaking,
so I set my silverware down and busied myself with my napkin for a
moment.
</p>

<p>
"Tea?" asked Arros, casually extending the pot with a friendly smile
that chilled me straight to the bone.  I nodded and pushed my cup
forward, keeping my hand in contact with the table the whole time to
hide my shakes.
</p>

<p>
"Anyway," Arros said, still in that casually relaxed tone that was now
far more disturbing than outright threats.  "It <em>is</em> a bother,
getting pulled away from what I'm doing to come down here and shred
the soul of some stupid mortal with poor judgement.  So, I'll tell you
what: I'll leave you a fragment of Myself.  You can consult with It
before you do something that you think might be a problem.  If It says
no, or even seems dubious, don't do whatever it is."  His looked up
from his tea and met my gaze; his smile remained friendly, but it
didn't reach his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"If you <em>do</em> disregard the advice of the fragment...well, let's
just say that all of us are tired of dealing with you on these
issues."
</p>

<p>
My entire side of the table was frozen.  Even the Landguard, their
paladinhood normally making them immune to fear effects, were
motionless and pale.
</p>

<p>
Arros swept his gaze up and down the table once, then released the
sense of doom he was radiating.  "More tea, anyone?" he asked
brightly.
</p>

<p>
I waited until I could lift my cup to my lips without my hands shaking
and sloshing it everywhere.  Sip.  Sip again.  Set the cup gently and
precisely back on the saucer.  Deep breath.
</p>

<p>
"Just one question, if I may, please?" I asked hesitantly.  I waited
for Arros to give me a regal nod before I continued.  "There won't be
any <em>ex post facto</em> punishment, right?  If we ask about
something and your fragment says ok, you won't decide after the fact
that what we did was too powerful and kill us all for it...right?"
</p>

<p>
Arros affected a hurt expression, one hand over his heart.  "Why,
Jake, how could you think I'd be so unreasonable?!  No, of course not.
I promise that neither I, nor any other god, will tear your soul to
aetheric shreds and scatter the fragments into the Far Realms if you
manage to exceed the expectations of my fragment."  He paused, then
gave me a thin smile.  "Of course, I wouldn't suggest deliberately
trying such a thing."
</p>

<p>
I blanched and had to take a moment to put myself back together.
"Right, understood, will comply, message oh-so-very-much received." I
paused to swallow and work some spit back into my suddenly bone dry
mouth.  "Uh...I guess, as long as you're here, I could ask you: we
need to produce a fair amount of magical gear for our army...things
like Fortifying Bedrolls, maybe Rings of Regeneration, magic swords
like the Landguard have.  Nothing crazy powerful and I think it's
mostly on the regular item lists.  Is it ok if I automate that
process?"
</p>

<p>
Arros pursed his lips, eyeing me thoughtfully for a long moment.
"You'd need to use Wishes for that, and lots of them.  How do you
intend to deal with the experience point requirements?"
</p>

<p>
I gulped.  "I figured I'd use one Wish to create a battery that stores
experience points.  I'll only make one, and it won't be
refillable&mdash;once it's empty, it's empty.  It'll be able to
allocate some of its contents into any spell engines that we create,
or to provide them to a caster for purposes of crafting or
spellcasting.  Nothing else&mdash;it won't let people just level up.
Is that ok?"  I held my breath, hoping that this wasn't going to get
me crushed like a bug.
</p>

<p>
He pondered, then shrugged acceptance.  "I suppose so.  As long as you
don't start supplying magic items to outsiders, and you keep it to
relatively straightforward items&mdash;I would suggest avoiding Rings
of Wishes and Candles of Invocation, for example.  But Fortifying
Bedrolls and Rings of Regeneration aren't a problem.  Those swords are
fine as well, but only for the Landguard."  He flicked a glance at
Thomas.  "And, Commander?  Keep your intake process as it is.  Don't
start having one every week or lowering your standards just so that
you can outfit everyone in Gr&#491;fhamr with your gear."
</p>

<p>
Thomas nodded gravely.  "Yes, Magelord, I understand.  One request:
the Landguard has suffered enormous losses recently, and we are in the
process of using Ice Assassins to refill our ranks. The Writ restricts
us to two thousand members, so we won't go beyond that.  Is it
permitted?"
</p>

<p>
Arros cocked his head, an amused expression on his face.  "So, you're
going to create a Landguard consisting of hundreds of copies of your
existing members, all of whom are magical constructs that desperately
want to destroy their originals and will be looking for any loophole
in their orders in order to accomplish that goal?"  He snickered.  "In
addition to being God of Magic, I am also the God of Cleverness and
Lawyers. How can I say no to an idea as crazy as that?  Only a paladin
would be willing to take such a crazy risk.  Feel free."
</p>

<p>
Thomas nodded his head in gratitude, but didn't speak.  He was a lot
braver than I was, and he had that whole 'immune to fear because
paladin' thing going on, but I was pretty sure he was still almost as
rattled as I was by Arros's casual discussion of soul-rending and
Far-Realms-scattering.
</p>

<p>
Arros glanced around at the state of everyone's lunch.  For the most
part, we had all just nibbled, too focused on the rather terrifying
discussion to eat very much, but we had all at least had enough not to
offend the chef.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I must be off.  I'll leave the table and food so you can all
finish up.  Oh, and here's that fragment that I promised." He opened
his hand to reveal a tiny sun, no larger than my thumbnail but so
bright that I couldn't look at it, and so hot I could feel the heat
from across the table.
</p>

<p>
Arros flicked his fingers and the sun leaped across the table,
straight into Reynard's open mouth.  The Archmage body jerked into an
agonized arch and he screamed.  His skin flared red as though he were
being burned from the inside, and golden light blasted from his eyes
and throat.  The seizure went on for long, long seconds before he
suddenly relaxed, his face going calm and blank.  His eyes blinked
open to reveal only swirling multicolored light.
</p>

<p>
<strong>"I am here, Master,"</strong> said my recently resurrected
friend in a chorus of completely inhuman voices.
</p>

<p>
Arros gave a happy smile.  "Excellent!  Do try to keep them in line,
won't you?  Anyway, I'm off!"
</p>

<p>
He vanished in a puff of smoke, leaving us sitting in front of a
lovely luncheon alongside an inhuman semi-divine monster who wore
Reynard's skin like a cheap suit.

<p>
"In a society without death, Ingfred is 20 years old and has no
prospects. All the good jobs are filled by undying masters of their
craft, and it's hard to be taken seriously when you are, compared to
everyone around you, an infant.  Fortunately, he has a solution:

There's two problems: how can Ingfred convince a powerful wizard to

And, once that's done...how will Ingfred deal with the law?"
