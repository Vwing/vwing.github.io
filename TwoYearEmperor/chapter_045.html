<p>
Three minutes after meeting him, I hated Colborn L&ouml;fgren.  Now,
two hours after meeting him, I was ready to let Thomas stab him in the
spleen nine or ten times.  Actually, maybe the kidney; when kidneys
hurt, they hurt a <em>lot</em>, and I was currently entertaining fond
thoughts of Colborn writhing on the ground in pain and peeing blood
for a month or three.
</p>

<p>
No, I wasn't still psychotic; Colborn was just that big of an asshat.
I wasn't the only one who thought so, either.  Less than ten minutes
after this meeting had begun, Thomas had had to send Duncan out of the
room because the good sergeant looked about ready to rip Colborn's
arms off&mdash;his fingers were flexing into claws, his face was pale
with rage, and he had actually taken a step towards Colborn.  Unlike
his subordinate, Thomas was carefully keeping the neutral expression
and calm body language of a professional bodyguard and
politician&mdash;I suspect that that "I'll be more careful about my
temper" thing that he'd promised Shailos was getting a good
workout. Alpha Squad were doing an excellent 'unobtrusive statue'
impersonation in the corners of the room, but personally, I was about
ready to call Duncan back and let him have a go at Colborn the way he
so clearly wanted to.
</p>


<p>
"Don't be foolish, Albrecht," Colborn sneered.  "The reason you've
been so ineffective to date is because you lack a mage powerful enough
to handle enemy magi as they teleport in.  Now that I'm here, we can
start making some progress.  The liches obviously need to be your
first target; I know precisely where Hammond's crypt is, and he thinks
I'm a trusted subordinate, so he'll let me through his defenses.  I'll
go capture him tonight; we can turn him the same way you turned me,
and I'll have an excellent lieutenant for future expansion.  It should
be easy enough; I doubt I'll need more than a couple squads of magi to
deal with his defenders...oh," he said, turning to me with an airy
wave.  "I'll bring a few dozen of these 'Landguardians' of yours,
John.  Meatshields are always handy to keep the pointy-stick people
off us magi while we're getting the work done."
</p>

<p>
"First of all, it's Jake.  Not John," I said with a dangerously soft
voice and a smile that showed all my teeth.  "Second, it's
'Landguard', not 'Landguardians'.  Third, you and your ego can go
fu&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"An interesting idea, Colborn," Albrecht put in, speaking louder and
faster than was his wont as he quickly cut me off.  "I think we should
talk about the details a bit more, though.  After all, a lich isn't
the sort of enemy you go after without preparation...even for a mage
of your calibre that would be foolish, and I remember you as far too
intelligent for such an obvious blunder."
</p>

<p>
Glancing around quickly, Albrecht verified that he had captured
everyone's attention and no one (i.e. me) was about to say anything
that would actually cause a fight. "It seems to me," he continued,
"that the thing to do right now is to find an isolated group of lesser
drauga and wipe them out...a shakedown mission, if you will.  It'll
give us a chance to practice coordinating with each other, let us
learn how best to maximize our collective effectiveness."
</p>

<p>
Colborn threw up his hands.  "For the love of all the gods, Albrecht!
It's simple: I kill things while the meatshields keep things off of
me.  We've done this a thousand times!  How many battles did I win for
you in the Dwarf War?  I know you get all excited about making
complicated plans, but they just aren't necessary!"  He spoke slowly,
as though trying to get through to a particularly dim child.  "I am a
Master High Mage.  I do battlemagic.  I kill things. I kill things a
lot.  You give me meatshields, I give you battles."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht sighed and paused to find the right words.  "Colborn, do you
remember the battle of Eagle's Crag?"
</p>

<p>
Colborn paused, nonplussed.  "We won, didn't we?" he snapped, sounding
petulant.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Colborn, we won.  And <em>why</em> did we win?"  Albrecht's
voice was the soul of patience. A spike of delighted schadenfreude
went through me and I smiled viciously; I was pretty sure that Colborn
was about to be thoroughly schooled, and I couldn't wait to hear it.
</p>

<p>
"I would have dealt with it," Colborn grumbled, not meeting anyone's
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Why did we win, Colborn?" Albrecht demanded, refusing to let him off
the hook.
</p>

<p>
Colborn's lips twisted in disgust.  "You mined the pass behind us; the
drow got behind us without us noticing, but were blown up before they
could attack," he admitted unwillingly.  "I would have dealt with it!"
he flared.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht snorted.  "Like you dealt with the catapults at Three Peaks?
Or the mage attack at Loptv&#491;llr?  Or that cleric that dumped a
landslide on you at Barrowhamr?"
</p>

<p>
"Fine," grumbled Colborn.  "We'll do your silly training mission.
Let's just get it done quickly so we can make some actual progress on
this war."
</p>

<p>
"Tell you what, Colborn," I said icily.  "Let's have a little
competition.  You and three people of your choice against me and three
people of my choice.  I'm betting that we kill more undead than you
do.  Albrecht, you're the judge."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht paused in surprise.  "Ah...well..."
</p>

<p>
I turned away, leaving him floudering so I could focus on Colborn.
"Well?  What do you say?"
</p>

<p>
Colborn sneered.  "Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a Master High Mage,
you're...what?  A zeroth level commoner?  Maybe a noble?  I doubt you
could even kill a single wraith; I can kill thousands in a single
round.  I'm hardly going to waste my time on such a joke."
</p>

<p>
I smiled viciously.  "Scaaaaredy-cat, scaaredy cat, big 'n' fat,
nothin' but a scaredy-cat," I chanted in an obnoxiously childish
singsong.  I dropped the singsong and sneered. "Sounds to me like you
don't think you can keep up, pansy."  I shifted to babytalk, wiggling
my fingers at him like an adult entertaining an infant.  "There there,
little Coalbum, it's ok.  Don't cry, widdle Coalbum.  Half my kills
won't count!  No, dey won't count, idn't dat right?  No dey won't!
Does dat make your poor widdle ego feel be-tah? It should!  Yes it
should! Poor widdle ego, so sens-i-tive, yes id is!"
</p>

<p>
Dropping the baby talk, I stepped right up to Colborn until we were
practically nose to nose.  I pulled myself up to my full six foot
three&mdash;a good four inches taller than him&mdash;and poked him in
the chest with one finger, hard enough to make him flinch.  "You think
you're so effing special because you've got magic?  It's rotted your
brain, you arrogant jackass.  So far, all I've seen out of you is a
lot of talk.  My team kills twice as many undead as yours, in the same
amount of time, by Albrecht's count. Oh, I'll even make it easier for
you: I won't use my god-like 'destroy mountains on a whim' attack, and
neither one of us will use that stupid Ring-Gate-Force-Sword trick of
Albrecht's, since it would put us on an even footing.  Better yet: No
one on my team will cast one single spell.  Now put up or shut up, you
stinking bedsore."
</p>

<p>
Colborn's face flushed red with rage.  "You little&mdash;" He raised
his hands threateningly and opened his mouth to cast; Alpha Squad
materialized around him, seven swords pressed to his neck and the very
tip of the eighth&mdash;Robert's offhand sword&mdash;physically inside
his mouth. He gagged a little, his incipient spell vanishing in a
swirl of glittery sparks.
</p>

<p>
Everyone froze, waiting to see what would happen next.  A slight
trickle of blood running down Colburn's neck and going splot! on the
floor was the only movement or sound in the room.
</p>

<p>
Once it was clear that things were, for the moment, stable, Thomas
sheathed his swords&mdash;he had been ready to use their antimagic
powers if Colborn got stroppy&mdash;and stepped forward, gently
pulling me back and out of his way.  Robert shifted slightly to the
side to give him room.  Thomas stopped at 'polite conversation'
distance from Colborn and studied him calmly for a few seconds.
</p>

<p>
"Master High Mage Colborn L&ouml;fgren," he said, with a calm
politeness that fit very poorly with the ring of swords jammed up
against Colborn's neck.  "May I respectfully request that you not use
spells against His Imperial Majesty Jacob?  He is, in point of fact,
the ruler of the Flobovian Duchy of Anundj&aring; and therefore your
liege lord.  Now.  His Majesty has proposed a wager; I think the terms
are quite fair, although I will stipulate that you may not choose
Landguard as your assistants.  Do you accept the wager?"  With a
gentle smile, he waved Alpha Squad back.  It was a very long couple of
seconds before they actually stepped back; Robert took a moment to tap
his sword against Colborn's teeth before withdrawing it completely,
which made me wince.  Metal on teeth feels horrible.
</p>

<p>
Colborn seemed shaken, but rapidly recovered.  "Fine.  I accept your
wager.  As a forfeit, after I win you give me a company of my choice
and leave me alone so I can go win the war."
</p>

<p>
I let a predatory smile spread across my face.  "Fine.  And when I
win, you will run through all of Gr&#491;fhamr naked, shouting 'His
Imperial Majesty Jacob is brilliant!  He was right and I was wrong!'
over and over until you drop from exhaustion.  Oh, and afterwards you
have a training session with Sergeant Duncan to learn appropriate
military decorum."
</p>

<p>
Thomas coughed.  At least, he tried really hard to make it sound like
a cough.  The way his eyes were dancing, I'm pretty sure it was
actually a strangled snort of maniacal laughter.
</p>

<p>
Colborn's eyes narrowed.  "Fine.  Challenge accepted," he snarled at
me. With a derisive sniff he turned to Albrecht.  "You're the judge.
Where and when are we doing this?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht carefully didn't smile, but I saw a tiny tremor at the corner
of his mouth; I suspected he found Colborn just as annoying as we did,
and didn't mind watching him get taken down a few pegs by the
'meatshields.'  "Let's say the day after tomorrow, noon.  I'll have
our diviners scry out a good location&mdash;somewhere in the
mountains, ideally."
</p>

<p>
Colborn gave a jerky nod and stomped out of the room.  As angry as he
might be, I noticed that he was unconsciously fingering the small wound
on his neck.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht made sure that he was well out of sight before turning to me
with a concerned look.  "Are you sure you can do this, Jake?  Turning
him loose would be a disaster&mdash;he'd go after one of the liches
and they'd either destroy him or, worse, turn him back to their side."
</p>

<p>
I laughed.  "Pretty sure, yeah.  I'll just need to borrow a few
things; I'll get you a list."  Remembering something, I turned to my
chief bodyguard.  "Oh, also, Thomas&mdash;let me see that Sending
gauntlet of yours for a minute.  I need a command word magic item to
experiment with."
</p>

<p>
He raised an eyebrow but handed it over.  I took it with a grim smile,
pretty certain that I was going to destroy the rules of this universe
yet again.
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
"Wow, that's a lot of undead," I commented quietly.  I was lying
belly-down, peering over the edge of an escarpment into the rocky
valley below.  To my left and right lay Duncan and Thomas, grim
expressions on their faces.  A few yards to Thomas's right lay
Albrecht, Colborn beside him.  Colborn was grinning wolfishly as he
surveyed the enemy.
</p>

<p>
There were a <em>lot</em> of them.  I mean, really seriously a 
<em>lot</em>.  Like, two or three square miles of them, mostly shadows
and wraiths.. And they weren't just standing around, they
were <em>seething</em>, passing through each other as they wandered,
apparently randomly, from place to place. And, just to put the cherry
on the cake, in addition to all the incorporeals we had seen vampires
going in and out of the large pavillions in the center of the army.
</p>

<p>
Having looked enough, we leopard-crawled backwards, not standing up
until we were far enough back to be out of sight.
</p>

<p>
"What is that?!" I asked Albrecht, jerking a thumb over my shoulder at
the massed forces below us.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht lip twitched in an ironic half smile.  "Afi's 23th Legion.
This is their staging ground; from here he can drop a Teleportation
Circle and deploy them almost anywhere in a few hours.  They just sit
here, waiting to be sent out."
</p>

<p>
I blinked "23rd?  He has twenty three armies that big?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht laughed.  "Oh no, not that many." The sadistic schmuck
deliberately paused just long enough for me to breathe a sigh of relief
before continuing.  "He's got about two hundred legions that we know
of, maybe more.  He moves them around a lot, to make it hard to get an
accurate count.  Anyway, that's about a million drauga down there; Afi
is by far the most powerful of the Lich Kings, and controls the
largest fraction of the drauga.  There should be plenty for the two of
you."
</p>

<p>
Colborn sneered.  "Do you want to concede defeat yet?" he demanded,
looking at me.  "There's no way you and your myrmidons can make any
significant dent in <em>that</em>."  He flung an arm out, waving
broadly towards the giant army below.  "Really, how many do you think
you can poke with your pointy metal sticks before they pull you down?"
</p>

<p>
I shrugged with a secretive smile.  "Nah, we're good.  Why don't you
kick things off?"
</p>

<p>
He looked at me for a moment, then sniffed and turned back to face the
undead that were just out of sight over the bluff.
</p>

<p>
He took a breath and then started speaking in that 'Yo, reality: shut
up and sit down' voice that characterized magic in this world.
"Greater Invisibility!  Teleport!"
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
Far out in the valley, Master High Mage Colborn L&ouml;fgren appeared
a few score yards from the tents of the vampire generals.  He stood in
the midst of a seething mass of wraiths and shadows; any living
creature would have had its lifeforce torn out in seconds, but Colborn
was no living creature, and they couldn't so much as tickle him.

<p>
His invisible arrival was heralded by a minor popping noise; a few of
the undead around him paused and rotated, looking uncertainly around
themselves for the source of the sound.  Most didn't bother.
</p>

<p>
This was, as it turned out, unwise.
</p>

<p>
"Fireball!  Fireball" Colborn cried, aiming for the tents.  With a
pair of loud whoosh-crump! noises, two giant spheres of flame
enveloped the silken pavilions, turning them to ash instantly.  Inside
the now-vanished structures, scores of vampires looked up from where
they had been dining; each held a squalling human infant in its pale
claws.  Every fanged mouth was smeared in blood, and each undead face
wore an identical look of frozen confusion.
</p>

<p>
"Sunburst!" Colburn shouted, dramatically throwing his arms out.
Eighty-five feet in front of him, an immense pulse of blinding light
flared into existence, reaching out greedily to tear the undead within
its area to rapidly-dissolving tatters.
</p>

<p>
Carefully positioned just outside of the spell's range, Colborn
enjoyed the suddenly clear view that he now had, allowing him to see
plenty of targets across the clear space where the vampires and their
tents had been a few seconds earlier.
</p>

<p>
A few of the nearest wraiths charged at him, trying desperately to
bring down this strange enemy caster who had no reek of delicious
lifeforce to drink.  Their inky claws slid through him uselessly,
unable to overcome the vampire's unliving nature and immunity to
normal attacks.
</p>

<p>
Colborn batted at them in momentary irritation, but didn't allow it to
distract him. "Sunburst!" he bellowed, vaporizing several thousand
more wraiths and shadows.  "Sunburst! Sunburst! Sunburst!"  Having
exhausted the ninth-level slots that he had filled with the
eighth-level spell&mdash;after all, Sunburst was <em>so</em> much
better than Meteor Swarm for this purpose!&mdash;he began burning
through his regular eighth-level slots.  "Sunburst!  Sunburst!
Sunburst!  Sunburst!  Sunburst!"
</p>

<p>
The drauga in eyeshot, the ones who knew what was happening, were
rapidly retreating underground.  That didn't matter much; there were
plenty of others in range, too uninformed or too stupid to run. With
his Sunbursts exhausted, Colborn began working his way down through his
less powerful spells, hurrying a bit.  He needed to get this done
before all of them could flee.  There should be time&mdash;the vampire
casters had been wiped out in his initial assault, so the Lich Kings
shouldn't know there was a problem...still, there might have been one
vampire away from the camp, or a ghost or other undead that happened
to have caster levels.  It wouldn't do to be overconfident.
</p>

<p>
"Incorporeal Nova!  Incorporeal Nova!  Incorporeal Nova!  Incorporeal
Nova!  Incorporeal Nova!  Incorporeal Nova! Prismatic Spray! Prismatic
Spray! Prismatic Spray!"  He took a moment to race to the side,
putting himself back in a nice dense cluster of targets&mdash;or, as
he preferred to think of them 'experience point dumplings.'  <em>~Not
that there'll be any XP from this,~</em> he grumbled
mentally.  <em>~Too low level for me, even a million of them isn't a
threat.  Well, at least I picked up a few crumbs from the
vampires.~</em>
</p>

<p>
Dragging his wandering thoughts back on track, he focused on
continuing to make the laws of physics pull the covers over their head
and whimper in misery.  "Prismatic Spray!  Prismatic Spray! Cone of
Cold!  Cone of Cold!  Cone of Cold!  Cone of Cold!"  Having cleaned
out that area, he once again relocated in search of enemies.  The
clusters were starting to break up; there weren't as many targets
available as there had been at the start of his attack.  "Cone of
Cold! Shout!  Shout! Shout! Shout!"  Again he had to relocate,
spending an extra round this time, since the area around him was so
thinned out.  "Shout!  Shout!  Fireball! Fireball!  Fireball!
Fireball!"
</p>

<p>
He stopped, looking around in satisfaction.  He was out of all of his
meaningful battlemagic, but the area around here had been demolished.
Tens of thousands of undead were simply gone, vaporized in the
Sunbursts or otherwise slain.  All in all, a satisfying way to spend
four and a half minutes.
</p>

<p>
"Teleport!" he announced, snapping himself back to where that puling
idiot was waiting.  Let's see him even come <em>close</em> to matching
this!
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
We all looked around at the faint 'pop!' that announced Colborn's
return.  He wore a nasty smirk that would normally have made me want
to smack his face off.  Right now, however, I was much too gleeful
about just how badly I was about to school him.
</p>

<p>
Truth be told, I had been a little worried that he might be smart
enough to come up with his own world-breaking exploits that would let
him win our little competition.  Nope; he'd gone for a simple
run'n'gun, teleporting into the middle of them and spraying killer
spells in all directions.  Given his age and power he was undoubtedly
smarter than I was, so I had to put it down to a combination of
arrogance and laziness&mdash;he probably hadn't felt like he needed to
do anything fancy to win this bet, so it just hadn't been worth his
effort.
</p>

<p>
I was really looking forward to watching his run through
Gr&#491;fhamr.  Oh yeah, this was gonna be good.
</p>

<p>
"So, how many?" Colborn demanded of Albrecht, giving a small sniff as
though it hardly mattered.  After all, surely he had this contest in
the bag.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht's lips were moving silently and he was moving his fingers as
he tallied up the kills in his head.  "Thirty thousand," he declared.
"Plus all the vampires.  I didn't get a good count on those, but it
looked like there were one, maybe two hundred of them?"  He glanced at
Colborn for confirmation.
</p>

<p>
Colborn opened his mouth to answer&mdash;agreement or a demand for a
higher count, I didn't know or care.  I cut him off before he could
get a word in.  "Let's just call it an even thousand.  I wouldn't want
to shortchange the Master High Mage."  I gave him an ironic bow.
</p>

<p>
Both Albrecht and Colborn stared at me in surprise.  Albrecht was the
first to recover.  "Ah...yes.  All right then; for Master High Mage
Colborn we have thirty one thousand undead killed in forty three
rounds.  Jake, I believe it's your turn.  You have forty three rounds,
and you need to kill more than sixty two thousand undead."
</p>

<p>
Colborn snorted derisively, and I just smiled and walked downhill a
bit to where my beautiful toys awaited.
</p>

<p>
Colborn's eyes followed me; immediately he frowned in puzzlement as he
caught sight of the new additions to the landscape and clearly
wondered what was under the thick tarps.  Narrow and about six feet
long, they were arranged in a shallow arc just below the military
crest of the hill.  Whatever they were, there were a lot of
them&mdash;eighty or a hundred at a casual glance.
</p>

<p>
"Before I start, let me tell you a quick story.  I'm pretty sure
you'll find it interesting," I said with a secretive smile.
</p>

<em><strong>Return of the Author's Note: </strong> A big 'thank you!'
to 5 Coloured Walker and the folks over at the GitP forums who helped
me come up with a lot of Colburn's tactics.  Once I knew what he was
doing I was able to do the math to figure out how many undead he
killed.  Let it be clearly known that these fine folk came up with
tactics that would have been a lot more effective than the simple
run'n'gun I ended up using.  I did it this way because it better fit
Colborn's personality and the general setting of the battle.
