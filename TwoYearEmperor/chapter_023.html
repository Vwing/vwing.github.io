owned by me.  This is a source of great sadness.</em>

<p>
"Allison, do you have&mdash;" Thomas cut off in the middle of a
sentence, his whole body tensing up as his bodyguard sense tingled
loudly.  "Shifter!" he yelled, blurring forward and yanking me out of
my chair.  He slammed me down on the floor, pinning my arms to my
chest with one knee.  A fast palm strike to my solar plexus left me
too busy trying to breathe to even consider fighting back.</p>

<p>
Even before he had me on the ground, the other Landguard had taken up
position around us, blades out, facing out.  Franklin tapped his
swords together as he took up position; a ringing sound swept across
the room, shaking my bones as it flowed over me.  As the sound passed,
the Continual Flame torches on the walls went out and Allison vanished
from the fireplace.
</p>

<p>
Thomas grabbed my jaw and forced my head to the side, first one way
then the other, inspecting me minutely as he did.  It felt like being
clamped in a vice.
</p>

<p>
"Ow, Thomas, cut it out!"  At least, that's what I tried to say.  His
grip on my mouth and jaw was strong enough that it came out more like
"oo tomaf kfut id fout!"
</p>

<p>
A dagger appeared in his free hand, the point about a nanometer from
my eyeball.  <em>~My, Flobovian smiths make excellent steel, don't
they?  Is that wootz?  It certainly has the water banding.
Impressive.  Also looks amazingly sharp.  Yep.  I would have thought
that sharpening to a monomolecular edge would be undesirable&mdash;too
easy to chip in real combat.  Well, Thomas is the expert.~
</em>

<p>
"After your summoning, what were Archmage Matthew's exact words when
he invited you to leave the Work Room?"  The tone made it quite clear
that this was a one-question pass-or-die exam.
</p>

<p>
He had slacked his grip just enough that I could talk, so at least I
wasn't mumbling.  "Matthew never said a word while we were in the Work
Room.  It was Reynard, not Matthew.  And he said 'perhaps you'd like
to relocate to a more comfortable location for the rest of this
conversation?  The Work Room is excellent for rituals, but remarkably
lacking in chairs.'"
</p>

<p>
The grim expression didn't change at all.  "Before I pulled you out of
the chair, were you under the effects of any enchantments?  Did you
feel at all odd?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Now would you please move that dagger somewhere else, it's
freaking me the hell out."  Something felt odd about that sentence,
but I decided that the the current
hey-look-my-bodyguard-is-about-to-kill-me-for-some-reason situation
should be higher priority than figuring it out.  I filed the thought
away in my memory gallery, tying a tag on it so I could find it again
for future consideration.
</p>

<p>
Thomas relaxed slightly, and sheathed his dagger.  Standing up, he
pulled me to my feet, sliding his hands down my body in a quick and
professional frisk.  I started to complain but he spun me around and
checked my back as well, down my legs and back up.  He even grabbed my
crotch; presumably it was just to be sure that I didn't have anything
in my jockeys that wasn't attached, but it still made me
yelp. Finally, he slid his hands up through my hair to check for
anything on my scalp.
</p>

<p>
I jerked away from him, angry and embarrassed.  "What are you doing?!
Cut it out!"
</p>

<p>
He nodded, stepping back and making a hand gesture to the others.  They
lowered their weapons and came down from red alert.  Franklin tapped
his blades together again; a different tone rang out, just as loud as
the first but at a different pitch.  In its wake the torches sprung
back to life and Allison reappeared.
</p>

<p>
"What in the firey pits of burning hellcrap was that?!  Ice on stone,
what did you do that for, you overgrown, metal-wrapped haggis-brained
meatbags?  Do your teensy eensy little waterbag minds have the
slightest idea how painful it is to be suppressed like that?!"
Allison was in fine form; she went off on a truly impressive cursing
streak.  At least a minute later she was still in full spate and
hadn't repeated herself once.  
</p>

<p>
Finally I tore myself away from listening and focused on Thomas again.
"She's got it right.  I think you owe me dinner and a movie after that
stop-and-grope; what in the hell was that all about?"  I was very much
not a happy camper.  Dire thoughts about 'hop on one foot for the rest
of the day' or 'go to the Plaza and sing the "I'm A Little Teapot"
song' orders were flickering somewhere in the back of my brain.
</p>

<p>
"We were talking and then you flickered.  You weren't in the same
position in your chair, you had on a different expression.  No
transition, just one moment <em>here</em> then the next
moment <em>there</em>.  That means magic; you could have been
replaced, or something could have been planted on you to control you."
</p>

<p>
That...actually made a fair amount of sense.  "And what was that
ringing thing?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas smiled sardonically and shrugged.  "We need to protect our
ruler against mages. Easiest way to do that, shut down their magic.
It keeps the situation stable, and it shuts off any magical disguises
or shapechanges.  There does tend to be some collateral damage though.
Sorry about that, Allison."
</p>

<p>
Her response wasn't printable and it went on for quite a while.
</p>

<p>
The Landguard and I settled back into our chairs. As we seated
ourselves, they sheathed their weapons and I rubbed my face, working
my jaw where Thomas had gripped it.  There were uncomfortable popping
noises that made me file a mental note to visit the cleric later for
some preventitive magical maintenance, just in case I had stress
fractures.
</p>

<p>
"So, if you weren't controlled or replaced, what was that flicker?"
Thomas may have accepted that I was me and not controlled, but he
still wasn't happy with the situation.
</p>

<p>
"That," I stated grimly, "was Jogan the Jocular, Wilgam the Wily, or
Karash the Kindly&mdash;whatever his local name is.  Personally, my
people know him as Coyote, Loki, and probably a bunch of other names."
</p>

<p>
They all just stared at me in shock.  Thomas put his head in his
hands, rocking it back and forth in exhausted frustration.  There were
a lot of groans from the others.
</p>

<p>
Finally Thomas sat up with a sigh.  "What did he want?" he asked,
sounding tired.  "Whatever it was, you didn't make any deals with him,
did you?"  The last was said with such a huge dose of fatalism that I
figured he knew the answer and hated it already.
</p>

<p>
I shifted uncomfortably in my chair.  "Well...actually, yes.  He
wanted us to find what the Deorsi are looking for and destroy it.  As
to what it is...he made a comment about 'smashing every stone from
narthex to nave', so I'm guessing it's a temple.  He also said we had
to find it fast, 'before they do', which seems like weak evidence that
it's close to where the Deorsi are right now."
</p>

<p>
Thomas nodded, more crisply now.  His unflappable calm was reasserting
itself, his aura of professionalism settling back around his
shoulders.  "Did he say why he wants it destroyed, or what the Deorsi
want with it?"
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.  "Nope.  But when I asked, he said that
he <em>couldn't</em> tell me that.  Not <em>wouldn't</em>,
but <em>couldn't</em>.  As though something were preventing him.  The
only thing I can think of that could prevent a god from doing whatever
he likes is a stronger god.  So, whatever this temple is, it's
probably dedicated to one of the most powerful gods in the local
pantheon.  We can check church records to see if they have any word on
old abandoned temples in that area."
</p>

<p>
There were nods all around the room.  Thomas finally responded "Well,
at least now we know."
</p>

<p>
My mouth quirked in a half smile; I just couldn't resist.  "Yes," I
said soberly.  "And knowing is half the battle.  Go 'Jo!"
</p>

<p>
They looked at me like I was very weird.
</p>

<p>
There was a knock at the door, making me startle.  Thomas got a
strange look on his face; 'sad but resigned' is the best I could
describe it.  "Come in!" I called.
</p>

<p>
The door opened and Duncan, Robert, Rob, Bob, and Aerith strode in.
</p>

<p>
I jumped up, gaping.  "You're alive!"  
</p>

<p>
Duncan scowled at me.  "Of course we're alive!  You don't think they'd
let perfectly good Landguard laze about in the afterlife when there's
a war on, do you?  They've been resurrecting us for the last three
hours.  I was one of the first ones up; I stayed down there to get
things organized, but once a few of the other Sergeants were on their
feet I grabbed these big lunks and came to reinforce you in case the
Deorsi decide they're feeling frisky again despite this truce I heard
about."
</p>

<p>
Thomas climbed to his feet; his posture was recruiting-poster perfect,
his expression perfectly military-blank, but I saw a hint of pain
somewhere around his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Duncan, Alpha Squad, please stay.  The rest of you, take guard
outside the door.  No visitors."  That was full Command Voice;
everyone's hindbrains got them moving before their cerebellum even
properly registered the words.
</p>

<p>
'Alpha Squad,' as they were apparently known (was there a Delta Squad?
If so, were they tasked with counterterrorism?) spread out and took up
guard around the room.  Duncan stayed on his feet, eyes on Thomas and
frowning fit to split mountains.
</p>

<p>
Thomas braced to attention, his eyes straight ahead and looking about
three feet over my head.  He paused, taking a deep breath.  "My Lord,
please accept my resignation as Commander of the Landguard.  By
allowing you to die on the field of battle I have failed in my duty
and shown myself unfit to serve.  I have been holding off until I
could transfer command smoothly; it's time.  Sergeant Duncan, for my
final act as your superior officer, I appoint you Commander of the
Landguard, sixty second High Defender of Ruler And Land.  Serve with
honor."
</p>

<p>
He snapped off what was obviously a textbook salute: feet together,
arms crossed at the wrists over his chest, hands fisted, head slightly
bowed. With a simultaneous stamp, every other Landguard returned the
salute.
</p>

<p>
My jaw fell to my lap in horror.
</p>

'narthex to nave' comment from last chapter and called it that the
Deorsi were looking for a temple.  Go 'Jo!</em>
