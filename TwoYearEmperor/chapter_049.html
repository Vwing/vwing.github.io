<p>
We all stared at her in disbelief.
</p>  

<p>
"You're kidding, right?" I asked, utterly floored.  I couldn't even
begin to categorize the problems with her plan.  "Do you have any idea
how...that's just...argh!"  I shook my head in emphatic
disbelief...and nearly floored myself in a more literal fashion, as my
queasy stomach did a flip and my hungover head stabbed me with an
icepick.
</p>

<p>
"Fifty thousand," Albrecht put in.  Even his <em>sang froid</em>
seemed to be somewhat cracked. "Gr&#491;fhamr is <em>fifty
thousand</em> Portable Holes, nested together.  That's a hundred
linear miles of tunnels, and it doesn't even count all the
extradimensional spaces inside that.  And you can't teleport inside
Gr&#491;fhamr&mdash;teleportation spells can't cross planar
boundaries, and each Hole is its own specific demiplane.  There's just
no way we could make that happen in any sort of practical timeframe."
</p>

<p>
"Well, first of all," she said with a smile, "do you have a better
idea?"
</p>

<p>
There was a long silence.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't think so," she finished, clearly suppressing a triumphant
grin.  "Here's how I think we can make it work...."
</p>

<p>
And then she laid it out in detail, pulling out sheets and sheets of
parchment with all the calculations sketched out in a hand so neat it
almost looked typeset.  We started off skeptical, progressed to
dubious, and finally had to reluctantly admit that it
probably <em>was</em> a workable, albeit Herculean, plan.
</p>

<p>
"The Landguard are the fastest people in Gr&#491;fhamr," Thomas said.
"Franklin, go give these plans to Sergeant Thorn.  Get Third Company
moving, on the bounce."  Franklin nodded, scooped up the parchment,
and turned for the door.
</p>

<p>
"Hang on," I called.  Franklin checked himself and turned back to us.
There was a more efficient way, but I wasn't about to make Thomas look
bad in front of the Deorsi.  Instead, I scribbled some orders on a
spare sheet of parchment and added it to Franklin's stack.  "Go," I
told him.  He vanished like smoke.
</p>

<p>
Drifa was human enough to preen just a little bit as the rest of us
shook our heads in disbelief that we were actually going to execute on
such a crazy plan.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht rapped the table with his knuckles to get our attention. "All
right, back to work," he told us.  "Next question: we need to figure
out how to deal with the Lich Kings, especially Afi.  Jake, any
ideas?"
</p>

<p>
I winced at being put on the spot...and at the last stab of the
headache that was finally starting to fade.  "Aren't these Polymorph
engines more important?  If they have a limitless supply of undead, we
need to shut off the flow ASAP.  Shouldn't we be investigating that
first?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht shook his head.  "<em>Strategic</em>, Jake, not tactical.
You've demonstrated the ability to kill the minor drauga in job lots,
and Colborn and I have some experience at that ourselves.  We can deal
with them later; the important thing is to take out the leadership,
the ones who created those spell engines.  Besides, if we destroyed
the engines before the Lich Kings, they would just make more.  We'd
waste time and resources and be right back where we are now.  So, any
of your outside-this-world ideas on how to kill the Lich Kings?"
</p>

<p>
I hesitated.  "Those filly-whoosamadingies that let them resurrect
themselves&mdash;" I began.
</p>

<p>
"Phylacteries," Colborn supplied, rolling his vampiricly red eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Right, those," I replied, nodding appreciatively.  "Unless we destroy
those things, the liches just come back.  We'd need to find them
first, or there'd be no point in going after the liches at all.  And
I'm guessing that simple scrying won't do it, so we might have to...."
</p>

<p>
I stopped as a truly awful idea came to mind.  I checked the
Brainopedia to see if things were as I thought they were.  Sadly,
they <em>were</em> as I thought they were, which were actually not how
I were hoping they were.  I figured I'd get confirmation, in hopes
that maybe this wasn't really a viable strategem after all.
</p>

<p>
"Colborn, Unn...those spells, Greater Scrying and Greater Teleport,
what's the range?" I asked carefully.
</p>

<p>
Unn shrugged. "There isn't one.  They'll reach as far as you like."
</p>

<p>
I nodded thoughtfully, feeling a little sick.  God, it really would
work.  I knew how to destroy the Lich Kings and their phylacteries,
but the amount of collateral damage would make everyone I'd killed so
far into less than a rounding error. Good lord; how twisted did I have
to be to conceive of such a thing and, even worse, what did it say
about me that even as I was worrying about that, the back of my brain
was already working out the practical details?
</p>

<p>
I looked around for an alternative or a way to delay and, thankfully,
found one.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I've got a couple ideas but they haven't really gelled yet," I
lied.  "When we have Herr&uacute;n resurrected, she should be able to
help us find the phylacteries.  In the meantime, let's focus on more
immediate issues.  What about converting more of their vampire
casters, the way we converted Colborn?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht studied me for a moment, deciding whether or not to allow the
topic change.  Finally he shrugged.  "Possible, but difficult.  When
we were scrying for Colborn, I knew him well enough to draw an
accurate picture of him, and I had several of his hairs, so&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Colborn stared.  "You had my <em>hair?</em>  How did you get my hair?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht grinned.  "Remember that oil painting you made for my birthday
when you were nine?"
</p>

<p>
Colborn frowned, then got it.  "Oh lord, that horrible thing?  You
kept that?  Really?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht laughed.  "Yep.  Turns out, it was at the bottom of one of my
storage chests, along with some other family mementos.  Fortunately,
you were a lousy artisan; not only was it lopsided and muddy, not only
did it have lots of fingerprints where you tried to rub out mistakes,
but it had no less than six strands of hair stuck in the oil."
</p>

<p>
Colborn laughed.  "Saved by my younger self's lack of talent!  Ah, the
irony."
</p>

<p>
Everyone smiled politely.  "In any case," Albrecht continued. "We had
a good picture and a physical part of his body, which made it easy to
scry him.  He also happened to be off on his own when we scried him,
so we were able to teleport your Landguard right on top of him for the
capture.  We aren't likely to get that advantage again."
</p>

<p>
"Hmm," I mused.  "Colborn, Hammond and his boys don't know that you've
been turned yet, right?"
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.  "They shouldn't.  I was off on a hunt-and-capture
against some local refugee bands; I wasn't expected to report in for
another two days."
</p>

<p>
"How many junior casters did Hammond have?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
He shrugged. "I don't know exactly, but Hammond was one of the weakest
Lich Kings.  Probably not more than five or ten thousand casters of
High Mage level or above, and I'm only aware of a couple hundred
Master High Magi." He wiggled his fingers dismissively with a slight
sneer.  "And, of course, plenty of guppies, but they don't matter
much."
</p>

<p>
Thomas raised an eyebrow.  "Guppies?"
</p>

<p>
Unn sighed.  "Low- and midlevel magi.  It's not a terribly polite
term," she noted with a reproving glance at Colborn, which utterly
failed to make a dent in his ego.
</p>

<p>
I nodded, thinking about the implications.  Arrogant jerk he might be,
but Colborn was an enormously powerful wizard.  If Hammond had two
hundred more of his power level, and Hammond was one of
the <em>weakest</em> of our enemies...life was not so happy-making for
the home team. "If you found yourself engaged in a major battle and
needed to call for backup, how would that work?"
</p>

<p>
Colborn's brow wrinkled up as he frowned.  For a moment he reminded me
of a Buffy vampire with the nose ridges, but I quickly pushed that
thought aside.
</p>

<p>
"In a hundred and seventeen years, I've never needed to call for
backup," Colborn said icily.
</p>

<p>
"It's a hypothetical, Colborn," Albrecht assured him.  "I suspect that
Jake is thinking about how to make some of Hammond's casters come to
us, instead of us having to go to them."
</p>

<p>
Colborn sniffed, but went with it.  "Well," he began reluctantly.
"Hammond's protocol is to use a Sending to notify his Watch Captain of
the need for backup and the reason.  The Watch Captain then chooses
who to send in response and dispatches Sendings to the appropriate
casters.  We were all required to have a Greater Teleport memorized at
all times; if we got a dispatch order, we were to teleport to the
necessary location within three rounds of receiving the
order&mdash;that allows time for casting buffs first."
</p>

<p>
"What if the order sent you to a location you weren't familiar with?
How would you teleport there?" asked Thomas curiously.
</p>

<p>
Colborn shrugged.  "Typically you would teleport to the caster that
needed backup.  For example, 'Greater Teleport: one hundred feet to
the west of so-and-so'."
</p>

<p>
I nodded, thinking.  "How many of those Helms of Opposite Alignment do
we have?  And can we make more?"
</p>

<p>
Colborn, being newly arrived in Gr&#491;fhamr, looked to Unn.  She
thought for a moment and then shrugged. "I think there's two more;
they've never been common.  And yes, we can make more; it needs a
twelfth level mage and four days."
</p>

<p>
Thomas knew where I was going and asked the question before I could.
"How many magi twelfth level or higher do we have?"
</p>

<p>
Unn thought about that for a second.  "If you need an exact count, I'd
need to check my records, but it's about fifteen thousand."
</p>

<p>
I smiled grimly.  "Good.  So, let's make fifteen thousand Helms.  In
four days, we can see about taking fifteen thousand high-level casters
away from the Lich Kings.  That should make it a little harder for
them to find us."
</p>

<p>
Colborn snorted.
</p>

<p>
"What?" I asked in confuzzlement.
</p>

<p>
"Once they know we're out here, the Lich Kings won't have any trouble
finding us," he declared.
</p>

<p>
Drifa frowned.  "Why not?  We've been careful."
</p>

<p>
"This place is protected by a Weirdstone," Colborn pointed out.  "It
blocks teleportation within a six mile radius.  I'm not sure whose
army it was that was camped on your doorstep when you were in Snorri's
cavern, but whoever it was, they must have discovered that
teleportation was blocked in the area.  They could have rapidly
located the city itself by working around the perimeter, checking
where teleportation worked and where it didn't.  As soon as they had a
reasonable arc defined, it would be trivial to figure out where the
center was."
</p>

<p>
Everyone froze as we thought through the implications.  The five
separate 'thunks' of our stomachs hitting the floor formed a lovely,
syncopated beat that sounded vaguely like a samba.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, so once they know the general area they can localize us," I
began, looking for a silver lining.  "But as long as they can't find
our general location...."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht shook his head, looking pale.  "No.  It's worse than that.
The Weirdstone wards a twelve mile diameter area.  Given a quarter
million High Magi, you could divide the entire continent into a grid
ten miles on a side and try a Greater Teleport into each gridsquare.
As soon as one of the attempts fails, you've found a warded area.  And
Afi alone has well over a million High Magi."
</p>

<p>
We all took a moment to truly appreciate the depth of the hosedness
that was our life.  The degree to which we were screwed.  The fullness
of our doom.  The nuances of the 'you-will-die'nesses that were
currently piling on top of us.  The full flavor of&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Thomas cleared his throat; hope and courage flooded through us all as
he pushed his own courage and faith out to the rest of us.  Even
Colborn sat up straight, eyes brightening.
</p>

<p>
"Well screw Afi!" I declared firmly.  "We'll just have to jam his
radar.  And I know how...."
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
As the leadership of the bizarre city that was Gr&#491;fhamr planned
and plotted, events were unfolding elsewhere in the city.
</p>

<p>
"Move, move, move, move!" bellowed the leather-lunged Sergeant Thorn.
His voice echoed through the corridors of Gr&#491;fhamr, blurring off
into the distance.
</p>

<p>
People were tumbling out of their Rope Tricks, leaving the corridors
jam-packed and all but impassable.  The commands echoed down the
halls, rolling outwards from the Sergeant's position on a wave of
relayed orders.  One person would shout the order; a hundred segments
away the next person would shout it down the next section of corridor.
As the orders rippled by, more and more people were dropping out of
their extradimensional cubbies and standing ready for the next stage.
</p>

<p>
As always, talking was a free action so, as large as Gr&#491;fhamr
was, it took only a single round to pass the orders to the farthest
corners of the vast city.  Once every corridor was full, new orders
were passed, and the strangest bucket brigade in the history of the
world swung into operation.
</p>

<p>
It is, perhaps, worth considering the nature of the City Of Holes.
Take a long, straight tunnel, one hundred miles long.  Break it into
segments of various lengths.  Stick these segments to each other at
right angles, with no particular plan as to how they are arranged.
Since each segment is in its own extradimensional space, no branch
crosses with any other branch, so reaching a particular area requires
walking back up to the nearest common tunnel, then walking all the way
back down.  This is Gr&#491;fhamr.
</p>

<p>
There was one saving grace: after the city was assembled, each Hole
had a colored number painted on its wall for identification
purposes. This made it possible to refer unambiguously to any location
in the city, although directions became a bit convoluted.  ("Go to
White #3781, then take the lefthand branch to Yellow #4017, then the
righthand branch to Red #91 and you're there.")  Still, identifiable
or not, there was little rhyme or reason to the way the city was
assembled.
</p>

<p>
Rhyme and reason were being applied with a vengeance.
</p>

<p>
About seventy linear miles from Gr&#491;fhamr's exit, a young woman
named Hilda (who secretly pined for one of the boys in the adjoining
sleep group, and was frustrated that he wouldn't <em>take the damn
hint</em> and ask her out), peeled Portable Hole Green #6329 off the
air in front of her and dropped it into the waiting hands of her
father, Ulfric, who stood behind her.  Ulfric (who was fully aware of
Hilda's crush, and was torn between giving the boy the hint or
threatening him with grievous bodily harm should he so much as look at
Hilda) dropped it into the waiting hands of the woman behind him...who
dropped it into the waiting hands of the person behind her....
</p>

<p>
Six seconds later, the Portable Hole in question arrived at White #1
(more commonly known as 'the exit to Gr&#491;fhamr'), and was
carefully spread on the lefthand wall, thereby relocating ten linear
miles of tunnel and about a million people.  An instant later Violet
#8972, the segment of Gr&#491;fhamr that began thirty miles from the
door, arrived and was spread against the righthand wall.
</p>

<p>
And so it continued.  Each segment of Gr&#491;fhamr was split into
thirds, the first third placed on the lefthand wall of its parent, the
second third on the righthand wall, and the final third allowed to
continue forward.  The process was then repeated, again and again and
again, iterating on each of the sub-branches.  Steadily, the distance
from Gr&#491;fhamr's entrance to its furthest point shrank as segments
were shifted and reconfigured to fit into the minimum distance.
</p>

<p>
It wasn't a smooth process. People were lazy, or recalcitrant, or
clumsy, or foolish.  Sometimes people refused to come down from their
sleep area and join the human chain.  Sometimes the Portable Holes
were dropped on the floor, interrupting the steady flow. (Fortunately,
the corridors were too crowded for the Holes to land flat and reopen
as a pit; the resulting miles-long fall would have killed hundreds of
thousands.)  Sometimes people argued instead of simply handing the
Holes along.  Many people wanted an explanation.  And sometimes the
orders got distorted in the process of being relayed so many times.
Paiman Kaspersen, formerly a highly paid memory-sculptor, found
himself very puzzled as to why he was being told to "Bull the stole
off the ball at Purple-Yellow #6736 and gas it slack!"
</p>

<p>
In many cases, these issues could be sorted out by the people on the
spot.  In a few cases, where fights had actually broken out, stronger
measures were needed.  When a segment failed to appear within three
rounds, Sergeant Thorn would dispatch a Landguard to investigate.
That Landguard would be lifted (generally with some grunting) by the
nearest Gr&#491;fhamrite and dropped into the hands of the next...and
the next...and the next...effectively crowdsurfing along the commoner
railgun that had been formed through the length and breadth of the
city.  In this fashion, a Landguard could travel dozens of miles in a
single round.  High Marshal L&ouml;fgren might believe that it was
impossible to teleport inside Gr&#491;fhamr, but he had never
encountered the true power of Internet forums filled with D&D players
and their warped imaginations.
</p>

<p>
Once a Landguard appeared at the scene of a problem, that problem
hurriedly ceased to exist.  Whether the issue was misunderstood
orders, people refusing to work, or anything else, Flobovia's elite
soldiers resolved it quickly and efficiently. At which point they
would explain the importance of what was happening, thank the people
in the area for helping, and crowd-surf back to the entrance.
</p>

<p>
While the majority of the populace were involved in reconfiguring
their modular city, a select few were outside working on another
project.
</p>

<p>
The first step had been to have one of the magi cast Mage's Private
Sanctum on the ravine where Gr&#491;fhamr was currently located.  Thus
freed from the fear of being scried upon while they worked, a flood of
craftsmen poured forth and began building a half dozen altars to the
Lady of Secrets.  Sturdy tables of wood or stone were formed, each
intricately engraved with runes and writings taken from Master High
Priestess Drifa's parchments.  None of the workmen understood what
those runes and writings meant, so the carving process went painfully
slowly as each crafter carefully double- and triple-checked to be
certain that each rune or letter was exactly as it should be.  The
process was slowed even further by the fears of the Gr&#491;fhamrites.
After living cheek-by-jowl for so long, most of them had begun to
acquire some agoraphobia; working in the relatively open ravine was a
living nightmare for them.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, those members of the Landguard's Third Company not being
used as a mobile reserve by Sergeant Thorn were on hand for the
construction.  Some fanned out to stand sentry duty while others stood
ready to help; their massive strength made shifting giant stones into
position the work of moments, and they were always willing to hold
something, measure something, or whatever else was needed.  Most
importantly, as soon as they noticed the difficulties of the artisans,
they called on their status as paladins of the True God to lend their
own courage and faith to those around them.  Freed of their fears, the
artisans thanked the Landguard gratefully and buckled down to work.
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
Guardian Fourth Justin Wineholt was a 'tadpole,' a newly-minted
Landguard in his first year after intake.  Seventeen years old, he had
grown up as a marsh hunter on the edge of the Fens in Flobovia.  Today
he found himself on a separate continent, one of the last survivors of
the 'Guard after fighting his way through a literal ocean of undead,
and living inside a crazy city made of extradimensional spaces that
was packed with more people than he knew existed.  Truth to tell, it
was freaking him out; as a child of the marshes, he was used to lots
of open space around him, few people, and relative quiet.  A wild time
at home used to be when all twenty eight people who lived within a
day's walk of his parents would get together for music and dancing.
Capital City had been a painful adjustment; Gr&#491;fhamr had him
praying to the True God for strength at least once an hour.
</p>

<p>
Given all that, being outside in a narrow ravine with a small strip of
cloudy sky overhead was heaven, even if he did have to lug
eight-hundred pound boulders from place to place while overstressed
artisans yelled at him to hurry it up.
</p>

<p>
Under the circumstances, Justin could perhaps be forgiven for being
discommoded when one of his Landguard cohorts&mdash;a Guardian First
named Jasmine, who happened to be his swordmistress&mdash;raced out of
the city and proceeded to slap a Portable Hole on the ravine's
opposite wall.  The Hole opened to reveal more of Gr&#491;fhamr, the
tunnels packed full of people seething about like maddened ants.
Jasmine was promptly handed a Portable Hole by the person at the door;
she raced back across the ravine and applied this to the opposite
wall, next to the first.
</p>

<p>
As this new Hole opened, the people inside stumbled as though the
world had tipped around them.  "Oy, watch it!" shouted someone near
the entrance.  "Open it straight, you dizzy bint!  You just shifted
the gravity five degrees&mdash;any more and you could've killed
someone!"
</p>

<p>
Justin shuddered.  Great.  Now the damn city was multiplying, and
even <em>gravity</em> was something he couldn't count on.  Miserable,
he went back to hauling stones.
