<em><strong>Author's Note</strong>:  Still don't own D&D.</em>
</p>


<p>
<em><strong>Author's Note #2:</strong> Until September 21, 2014 I am
on the opposite side of the International Date Line from normal.  As
such, you are probably seeing this update on a different day than
normal.  Updates still happen on Saturday of whatever time zone I'm in
at the time.</em>
</p>

<hr />

<p>
"MOVE IT, MOVE IT, MOVE IT!" bellowed Duncan, shoving a stumbling
worker in the right direction.  "Get those camoflage nets up!  Afi's
troops could be here any minute!"
</p>

<p>
"Sergeant, the nets need to be shored up, they're almost falling
over!" a brown-haired man called.  In truth, he was right; the
Landguard who had pounded in the poles for the nets had put them in at
a drunken angle. They were almost twenty degrees from vertical,
leaning towards the end of the ravine away from the ritual.  It
brought the netting down a bit and made the camoflage pattern on the
outside blend less well into the surroundings.
</p>

<p>
Duncan spun on the man with a snarl.  "Get the damn nets up and stop
flapping your lips or so help me I will rip them off your piss-ugly
face!  We'll deal with the lean later, but get those nets up NOW.
MOVE!"
</p>

<p>
Cowed, the man went back to work.
</p>

<p>
Thomas wasn't letting me anywhere near the outside, but I could hear
Duncan's bellow even from the deepest reaches of the city.  Of course,
this was less impressive than it might have seemed, given the fact that
after our reorganization the "deepest reaches of the city" were only a
few dozen yards from the outside.  This fact had Thomas sweating
bullets right now; he had blockaded the corridor in front of me with
over a hundred Landguard bodies, all with their weapons in hand.  The
remainder were all helping to set up the netting.
</p>

<p>
"You let Duncan off punishment duty, huh?" I asked, just to break the
nervous silence.
</p>

<p>
Thomas shrugged without looking away from the door.  "Say what you
like about him, he's really good at kicking untrained people into
shape and getting them to do what needs to be done."
</p>

<p>
I nodded fervent agreement.
</p>

<p>
In truth, it was a good thing that I could hear Duncan, since his
bellowing was about the only thing that we could tell about what was
going on.  I'd tried to have a mage named Sigmund set up a JARVIS
system for me&mdash;use Scry Location to see the outside of
Gr&#491;fhamr, then relay what he saw into a Major Image for the rest
of us.  For whatever reason, that hadn't worked; the magic simply
failed to manifest.  He'd also tried an Arcane Eye, but that had also
failed.  The failure had everyone on the edge of freaking out, most
especially Thomas.  When he demanded of Albrecht if this was normal,
Albrecht had shrugged and said, "We don't typically scry close in to
the city, for fear that it might be detected.  We use physical scouts
for in close."  Thomas had nearly killed him on the spot in sheer
frustration.
</p>

<p>
Given this lack of direct knowledge, everything I know about what
happened is based on the after-action debrief that we had given Duncan
and the other Landguard who were outside at the time it all went down.
Working from their descriptions, Sigmund was using a Major Image to
throw a composite view of the events up on the JARVIS screen to aid in
understanding.
</p>

<p>
Sigmund set down the last transcript and made a few final adjustments
to the Image.  "Remember," he warned us.  "This is a depiction, not an
exact rendering.  I'm filling in details that weren't covered by the
reports, so there might be differences between what I'm showing and the
actual events."  He nodded to Duncan.  "Sergeant, if you see anything
wrong, please point it out."  Duncan nodded crisply.  
</p>

<p>
With his warning issued, Sigmund started the story playing before us.
I leaned back to watch, wishing I had popcorn.
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
The edges of the ravine were towering walls of red sandstone, a
hundred feet high, veined with inclusions and the occasional fossil.
The sun was westering, so everything was cast in gloomy shadow.  The
sand and gravel that covered the canyon's floor were being churned
into spurts of gritty dust by the flying feet of the people
sacrificing.  They were racing through the ritual like greyhounds
chasing the rabbit.  A hundred yards farther down the ravine, groups
of soldiers&mdash;including the rather terrifying Sergeant Duncan (who
seemed even foul-mouthed and shorter-tempered today than
usual)&mdash;scurried like ants as they busily set up the netting.
</p>

<p>
"You with the reinforcement panels!  Line up!  We want them all going
up at once so the netting stays even!" Sergeant Duncan's face was red
and spittle was flying from his mouth in the terrifying display of
rage common to all effective drill instructors.  "Ready an action to
deploy on my command!  You WILL deploy to your left side as you face
the ritual!  You WILL deploy on the command and not before or after!
Because, so help me, if any of you stupid monkeys deploys early or
late, I <em>WILL</em> RIP YOUR WORM-EATEN PUSTULENT LUNGS OUT THROUGH
YOUR SKULL AND&mdash;" There followed a great deal of highly
threatening profanity (see prior comment about the shortness of temper
and the foulness of mouth) which left the men and women holding the
rolled-up black cloth feeling very motivated indeed.
</p>

<p>
Time trickled by much more slowly than any of us would have preferred,
leaving Duncan to glare at his well-motivated minions.
Gr&#491;fhamrites were still running back and forth across the narrow
ravine, sacrificing to a goddess that did not currently exist.  The
black flames continued to crackle, their colors shifting briefly as
each person made his or her sacrifice.  The sun inched downwards,
crawling across the sky with glacial speed.
</p>

<p>
Finally, after about a billion subjective years, a sparrow made of
smoke appeared in front of Duncan and whispered, "Ready."  Stepping to
the side of the ravine Duncan sucked in a lungful of air and, in his
best drill-sergeant command voice, he ordered the men and women at the
netting to "DEPLOY! NOW NOW NOW, DEPLOY NOW!"
</p>

<p>
Those men and women shook out the rolled-up Portable Holes that they
had been holding and slapped them up on the leaning-over netting.
"UNSHRINK!" they all screamed.
</p>

<p>
It is worth doing a thought experiment about the mathematics of
volume.  A Portable Hole is six feet in diameter and ten feet deep,
containing roughly two hundred and seventy cubic feet of space.  A
cubic foot can hold roughly eight gallons of water.
</p>

<p>
Now, imagine filling a Portable Hole with water&mdash;over two
thousand gallons of it&mdash;and then touching that water with the
Rule of Size and saying the remarkably silly word 'Reducio.'
Instantly, the size of the water is decreased by a factor of sixteen
in each dimension, leaving you with roughly two quarts of water; this
is barely a puddle at the bottom of the Hole.  Reduced water will not
Reduce again, but you can still refill the Hole and Reduce the regular
water.  Do this enough times and you will now have two hundred and
seventy cubic feet of space filled with water that is compressed to
less than one four-thousandth of its normal size.
</p>

<p>
Now make that holy water, and restore its size all at once.
</p>

<p>
From each of the six Holes erupted a tsunami&mdash;nearly nine million
gallons each, blasting forth all in an instant.  The water howitzer
arced up and over the altars and back down on the other side.  Three
of the men deploying the Holes, and one of the women, were not careful
enough to be completely out of the way when they triggered the
enlargement.  They were effectively vaporized in the
blast&mdash;whichever part of their body was in front of the water was
torn cleanly off, sending them spinning into the water blast emerging
from the Hole behind them; this instantly smashed their bodies into
pulp and spread it over several hundred feet of downrange canyon.
</p>

<p>
The price to the enemy was far higher.  Unseen by anyone present,
Afi's Ice Assassins were floating invisibly back and forth above the
altars, busily sacrificing every secret they possessed: the nature of
their existence, the spells they had memorized, even the knowledge
that they had spell slots.  All of these secrets were being fed as
quickly as possible&mdash;far more quickly than the Gr&#491;fhamrites
were managing&mdash;into the shell that would eventually become the
Lady of Secrets.  It was a brilliant plan that Afi had been
maneuvering towards for a long time, and it was now blown thoroughly
to hell.
</p>

<p>
As the water arced up and over the ritual area, the sky over the
altars was filled with instantly-cut-off screams.  Wisps of black
vapor steamed into the sky, the last fleeting traces of the most
powerful group of non-divine beings on the planet.
</p>

<p>
Cheers went up as the lich-clone-things were instantly erased from
existence; it would have been better if we could actually have seen
their bony bodies vaporize, but the screams and smoke trails were
pretty satisfying all on their own.
</p>

<p>
Of course, a few of the Ice Assassins had been missed, through caution
or good fortune on their part.  A few of the ones towards the center
happened to be low enough that the water passed over their heads.
Some, more observant or just feeling more paranoid than the rest, had
readied actions when they saw what was happening at the netting; they
were able to cast various warding spells.  As the water went by,
spheres of pure magic, cubes of force, and immaterial draconic wings
appeared, shielding their casters from the divinely empowered
onslaught.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately for them, Gr&#491;fhamr wasn't done yet.  
</p>

<p>
From atop the cliffs, a rain of large, warty
amphibians&mdash;fenfrogs, to be exact&mdash;sluiced over the
surviving liches.  One of the first orders I'd given when arriving in
Flobovia was to start harvesting the magic-eating critters from the
Carr Fens; I had never rescinded that order, so Flobovians had been
harvesting them for nearly three weeks now, passing them back up the
commoner railgun to Capital City and stockpiling them.  When we fought
our way into Gr&#491;fhamr, it had seemed like a good idea to bring
some of them with us.  It's quite surprising how many cat-sized frogs
you can pack into thirty-one Portable Holes and a lot of
Landguard-borne Handy Haversacks, Belts of Many Pouches, and various
other extradimensional storage.  (Although you do need to remember to
put each 'frog in a sack first, so they keep their tongues to
themselves and don't eat the magic of the item you're trying to put
them in.  That had been embarrassing.)  Add a Darsson's Cooling Breeze
to each of the Holes so that they don't suffocate, season with a
Permanency from the Eternal Hourglass, and voil&agrave;!  An ideal
anti-lich weapon.  I had actually intended it for use against Afi's
vampire casters, but this was even better.  
</p>

<p>
Sadly, it was a bit of a one-shot attack. The 'frogs were falling over
a hundred feet; when they hit the ground they splatted like a bug on a
windshield.  Their last moments were happy ones, however, as they
found themselves plummeting through the largest bounty of magic they
had ever tasted.  Amphibian tongues darted in all directions, flicking
against protective spells that would have stopped a charging dragon
and slurping them down like candy.
</p>

<p>
More importantly, the ones that came after them had unobstructed
access to the liches themselves, and happily sucked the spellcasting
ability right out of the undead archmagi.  Over sixteen thousand
frogs&mdash;eighty percent of our stockpile&mdash;plummeted to their
doom; the liches never had a chance.
</p>

<p>
Appearances had had to be kept; setting up the nets and deploying the
Portable Holes had required coming up with, and loudly announcing,
plausible misdirections about camoflage netting.  More importantly, it
had not been possible to pause the flow of Gr&#491;fhamrites through
the ritual lest we raise the suspicions of the highly intelligent
ice-liches.  As a result, there were hundreds of people in the area
under the frog strike.  Most of them were clubbed unconscious by large
amphibians landing on their heads and subsequently painfully battered
by the following amphibious assault until the victims were buried
under a solid layer of frogs.  Fifteen people were killed
instantly&mdash;having bad luck in the hit point lottery at birth is
a great misfortune when thousands of cat-sized frog monsters come
crashing down on you.  It's also a really embarrassing thing to have
to tell the other spirits in the afterlife: "So, Tom, what are you in
for?"  "Oh, I died in battle, holding the line at Eagle's Crag!"
"Cool!  How about you, Bill?"  "Um...a frog fell on me.  And I think
my boss threw it."
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
"How did you know, M'Lord?" Suze asked quietly.
</p>

<p>
I smiled slightly; I just couldn't resist.  "Elementary, my dear
Suze!" I told her cheerfully.  
</p>

<p>
None of them got it, which made me sigh.  Tough room.
</p>

<p>
"The flames, young lady," Unn said, speaking with the didactic tone of
an experienced mage who was accusted to lecturing apprentices.  "Their
color depended on the alignment of the person sacrificing.  Lord Loki
informed us that the blackness was not an aspect of the ritual itself,
therefore the obvious conclusion was that it was representative of
another alignment.  If white-gold represented Lawful Good, what
alignment would pure blackness represent?"
</p>

<p>
"Um...Evil?  Maybe...Chaotic Evil?" Suze replied uncertainly.
</p>

<p>
Unn nodded with a small smile.  "Indeed.  It could represent Law, I
suppose; we can't really be certain from the information available."
She sniffed, irritated by the unavailability of data.  "In any case
yes, definitely Evil.  Now, when were the flames <em>not</em> colored
by sacrifice?"
</p>

<p>
"Um...when Lord Loki made his sacrifice?  And right after M'Lord
sacrificed his second secret&mdash;the one that was so high?" Suze
offered.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, very good!"  Unn's smile grew wider.  "How did you feel
during those two occasions?"
</p>

<p>
"Scared?"
</p>

<p>
Unn's smiled approvingly and gave her a 'go on' gesture.
</p>

<p>
Suze nodded, piecing it together.  "So, the flames were normal when
everyone was scared and frozen in place, not sacrificing.  Probably
the Evil beings were startled too, and they also stopped.  But the
rest of the time, they were black, because something evil was
sacrificing.  And the flames only changed color for a moment during
each sacrifice, so if they were continually black, then it had to be a
lot of sacrifices happening very quickly, so there had to be a lot of
Evil beings."
</p>

<p>
She pondered a moment longer and then continued, comprehension dawning
on her face.  "And they had to be flying, because there was no room in
the ravine itself.  Unfriendlies can't pass through any of our squares
without provoking attacks of opportunity, and no one was reporting
that they suddenly had attack options."  She frowned.  "What about the
ash, though?"
</p>

<p>
Drifa took the conversational ball.  "What did Lord Loki say about
what happens when these 'Ice Assassin' creatures die?" she hinted.
</p>

<p>
"'If you kill it with fire while it's in its base state, the thing
melts harmlessly. If it's not in its base state it burns normally,
then reverts to its base state.  If you kill the base state any other
way, it explodes and throws painful ice fragments
everywhere&mdash;unless, as you surmised, you kill it inside an
antimagic field,' Suze recited thoughtfully.  "By 'base state', I
guess he meant its original lich form.  But if it was transformed into
an elf or something, the way the one we met was, then the elf form
would have burned, leaving the ash, and then reverted to being a
skeleton, which would have been destroyed by the holy water."  She
thought about that for a second, then lit up.  "Ah!  That's why the
ashes were of a creature instead of just paper!"
</p>

<p>
She frowned for a moment.  "But if they were transformed, why would
holy water...." She pondered a bit longer, then nodded in
understanding.  "Ah.  The force of the water blast killed the
Polymorphed form, making it revert to its lich form.  Then the
holiness of the water killed the lich.  I get it!"  
</p>

<p>
It turns out that, if we ever ran out of magical torches, Suze is
quite capable of lighting up a room with her happy smile.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht nodded, a merry look on his chubby face.  "Indeed.  And now
comes the best part!" He gestured towards the JARVIS screen, which was
now showing the part of the story where scores of Afi-clones, suddenly
deprived of their great cosmic magic powers by the slimy tongues of
swamp-dwelling amphibians, were hoisting their wizard robes up above
their bony knees and making a run for it...only to be chased down by
Landguard and Gr&#491;fhamrite soldiers.  The soldiers closed in on
the lich-clones like wolves taking a caribou, tackled them and tied
them up faster than a rodeo roper, and raced off after the next one.
</p>

<p>
Thomas was frowning.  "Fun aside, we have a problem&mdash;the undead
appear to have sacrificed far more secrets than we have.  Right now,
they probably represent the majority of what the Lady will be like
when she revives."
</p>

<p>
Silence fell as we all pondered that.
</p>

<p>
"Way to kill the mood there, Thomas," I told him with a sigh.
"There's a few million Gr&#491;fhamrites left to go, right?  And Loki
and I made unusually big sacrifices&mdash;maybe all that will balance
it out?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas shrugged one shoulder, not taking his eyes off the crackling
altar fires that burned in the screen.  They were a normal red-gold
now, briefly flickering to other shades as people made their
sacrifices.  Very briefly.
</p>

<p>
Unn had produced paper and pen from somewhere and was rapidly
scribbling numbers, periodically looking up at the ceiling as she dug
through her memories.  When her pen finally stopped moving, I didn't
like the expression on her face.
</p>

<p>
"Based on what I remember from when we all sacrificed, I would
estimate that the flames change color for less than a half second with
each sacrifice...perhaps less; I couldn't measure it more precisely by
eye.  For them to be continually black would require at least twelve
sacrifices per round per flame.  There are six flames, and they've
been black since the instant that they were lit, meaning roughly
seventy two per round.  It was about thirty minutes between when the
fires were lit and when the sacrifices began and we've been
sacrificing for three hours since then.  That means the undead
sacrificed, at a minimum, about one hundred and fifty thousand secrets
to our one hundred thousand...and that's assuming that there were only
twelve of them per flame per round.  We captured fifty three Ice
Assassins after the attack and we assume that was a small percentage
of the total, so there were probably far more than seventy two of them
making sacrifices.  There could have been hundreds or even thousands;
they might have sacrificed millions of secrets already."
</p>

<p>
She looked around grimly.  "If we run everyone in Gr&#491;fhamr
through once, we'll have sacrificed just under three million secrets,
meaning that the undead will represent <em>at a minimum</em> three
percent of the total, but probably far more."
</p>

<p>
"And running everyone through will take another four days," Albrecht
said grimly.  "I doubt we <em>have</em> four days.  Afi is certain to
notice that his Ice Assassins have been destroyed&mdash;possibly quite
quickly.  He could be appearing any time, with his army."
</p>

<p>
"He would still have to teleport to the edge of our exclusion zone,
then march in.  It would take him at least an hour," Drifa offered.
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.  "Nope.  If I were him, I'm teleport
in <em>above</em> the exclusion zone, then freefall down.  Six miles
would take him...I dunno, a couple of minutes?  He just keeps a
readied action so that he can cast Feather Fall right before he hits
the ground."
</p>

<p>
We all digested that for a minute.  <em>~The news just keeps getting
better, doesn't it?~</em> I thought.  <em>~Well, at least it can't get
any worse&mdash;oh crap, I did NOT just think that.~</em>
</p>
<p>
"Going back to an earlier point&mdash;the rate of sacrifice that Unn
calculated is assuming that she's right about the duration of the
color change being a half second," Drifa put in.  "If it were a tenth,
then they would have sacrificed at least seven times more than we
have.  And if they were sacrificing more than the minimum, which they
probably were, then it could be far worse.  No matter what, this is
bad."
</p>

<p>
<em>~Yep, shouldn't have thought that,~"</em> I told myself mentally.
I pushed the worry aside as best I could and focused on the screen.
"Seems to me, we have several problems right now.  "We need to know
just how far ahead of us Afi is, so we know if we should punt or
continue trying to out-sacrifice his icy little minions.  We need to
figure out how much time we have before he shows up, and we need to
get everyone out of here before then.  That about right?  Did I miss
anything?"
</p>

<p>
A round of headshakes went around the table.
</p>

<p>
"We don't have any clocks accurate enough to measure sub-second
intervals," Unn began.  "We could get a specialist fire mage out
there&mdash;perhaps someone with a fire affinity could tell more
precisely, although I'm not sure.  In any case, 'when is Afi going to
show up' seems like the most important question in that list to me."
</p>

<p>
I nodded distractedly, trying to figure out how to measure time more
accurately than available instruments allowed.  Could we magic up an
atomic clock?  A superduper high speed camera?  Time Stop would speed
the user up until the world was frozen; could we use that to measure
the change in the flames?  What about Unn's idea of a specialist fire
mage?  Did Flobovia have one?  Did I trust the Deorsi magi?  Whoever
we sent out might decide to lie and say that the enemy was too far
ahead, just because he was scared and wanted to get relocated earlier.
That couldn't be allowed; if there was any chance that we could make
the ritual pay off, we needed to take it.
</p>

<p>
The answer hit me and I snickered.  "Hang on, I think I know how we
can measure the duration of the color change," I told them, standing
up and waving for everyone to follow.  "Bring a torch, we'll need it."
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
Two hours later, after a ridiculous number of security precautions on
Thomas's part, we were standing outside, next to one of the altar
flames&mdash;comfortingly, there was no trace of black in its colors.
Thomas was next to me with an unlit torch in hand and a bemused
expression on his face.  The others were gathered around, also looking
puzzled and staying out of the way as a swarm of Gr&#491;fhamrites
went racing back and forth around us.  Just outside of that rush, the
rest of the Landguard&mdash;by which I mean <em>all</em> of
them&mdash;surrounded us in a series of concentric rings.  I felt
ridiculous.
</p>

<p>
Pushing that aside, I watched the flickers for a moment; nope, too
fast for me to time them.  I turned to Albrecht.  "I need the teleport
ward taken down for one round, can you do that?"
</p>

<p>
"That's unwise," he responded.  "It's possible that Afi is probing us,
constantly trying to teleport people in."
</p>

<p>
"But not <em>likely</em>, right?" I pressed.  "I'm pretty sure I can
get the color change duration measured accurately enough that we know
if we have a chance of beating Afi on the sacrifice front.  If not, we
should abandon the ritual right now so that we don't end up with a
Goddess of Secrets playing for the other team."
</p>

<p>
He looked disgruntled, but he dispatched a Sending.  A few seconds
later, a turtle made of purple smoke swam up to us.  In a clear
contralto it said, "Orders received and obeyed.  Wards down.  Will
resume in one round."
</p>

<p>
I nodded my thanks, faced the flames, and took the torch from Thomas.
</p>

<p>
"Allison!  I require you to provide light and heat from on top of this
torch!" I called.  I really hoped this worked, or I was going to feel
like a total idiot in front of absolutely <em>everyone.</em>
</p>

<p>
The torch surged up and a snarky voice asked, "Hey dork!  About
flippin' time you called me!  Do you have any idea how boring it's
been back at the castle?  Seriously, Suze is gone, you're gone, Duncan
and the Landguard are gone...without you there they've stopped giving the
servants the next day off if they stay up talking with me, so you can
guess how often they drop by.  It's gotten so bad, I've started
composing drinking songs.  Drinking songs!  Do you know how low a fire
elemental has to sink before she starts composing songs about
liquids?!  Here, I'll sing you one:
</p>

<p>
  <center>
Oh, 'tis a merry merry thing to sing sing sing <br />
And glug glug glug as we slug slug slug down our beer and whiskeeeeeey!<br />
We sing sing sing but it might be a bit offkeeeeeyyyyyy!!!!<br />
Because we've glug glug glugged down our beer and whiskeeyyyyyy!<br />
There's nary a drop nor a dram nor a horse's ham <br />
Left in my cup in my mug in my stein or stoup <br />
Speakin' of stoup, the barmaid's lookin' kinda cute <br />
Kinda cute and quite a beaut and she just brought me a duck<br />
And I think that means she'd like to&mdash;
</center>
</p>

<p>
"Wow, Allison, that was amazing!" I interjected, clapping loudly
before that could go where I thought it was about to go.  Leaving the
'quality' of the lyrics aside, the singing was quite amazing; she
sounded just like Ella Fitzgerald.
</p>

<p>
Well, if Ella had smoked nine packs a day her whole life and been
someone else who was totally tone deaf.
</p>

<p>
"Wasn't that amazing, everyone?" I asked, giving them all significant
looks as I kept clapping.
</p>

<p>
"Definitely, yes," Thomas said with a completely straight face.
"Never heard anything like it."  
</p>

<p>
Albrecht had taken his cue and was clapping ferociously as soon as I
was.  "Bravissima!  Bravissima, truly a masterful performance!  Ah,
fair elemental, I must agree with Thomas, that was beyond anything I'd
ever heard."
</p>

<p>
Unn was looking at us in confusion.  "What are you talking about?
That was utterly hor&mdash;" She broke off as Drifa's elbow caught her
in the ribs.
</p>

<p>
"Hormeic!" Drifa supplied, jabbing Unn in the ribs with her elbow
again, just for good luck.  "Yes, full of energy and verve.  Isn't
that what you were going to say, Unn?  A compliment for the singing of
the <em>very impressive</em> song composed by the elemental <em>whose
help we need?</em>" She gave her friend a meaningful glare.
</p>

<p>
"Oh.  Yes, absolutely," she said, completely unconvincingly.
"Energetic."
</p>

<p>
Allison's flames bent in a semblance of a bow.  "Thank you, thank you.
Just throw anthracite folks; no underwear please, just come to my
dressing room.  Thank you, thank you.  Also, you're all horrible liars
because that was explicitly designed to be godawful.  I am, after all,
the Brightly Shining Mistress of Annoying."
</p>

<p>
I snickered.  "Ok, busted.  It was horrible," I admitted.  Everyone
blew out a breath when it became obvious that Allison wasn't pissed
about it.  "On another topic," I said with studied casualness.
"You're obviously an expert on fire in all its forms and aspects.
Think you can tell us exactly how long those flames change color when
someone makes a sacrifice?"
</p>

<p>
"Thhhpt, you kidding?  Not even a thing," she responded.  Somehow I
got the feeling that she had rotated on her torch to better observe
the flames.
</p>

<p>
"One flickerflicker, two flickerflicker, three flickerflicker," she
counted softly to herself.  "About an eighth of a second.  Little
less," she told us definitively.
</p>

<p>
We looked at each other until Drifa voiced everyone's thoughts:
"Lovely."
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes later we were back inside the war room&mdash;which was now
inside a new Magnificent Mansion, inside a new node of Gr&#491;fhamr,
which had been thoroughly rearranged.  Allison was sitting on a small
dish of oil in the middle of the table and Unn was periodically using
Prestidigitation to gather all the smoke into a little gray ball near
the ceiling so that we didn't all suffocate.  We'd gotten a lot of
frowns and glares as we came in; apparently Allison was the only open
flame in the entire city, smoke being a major issue in a sealed
environment such as this.  (It was clever how many workarounds they'd
found: all light came from Continual Flame torches&mdash;which aren't
really flame and produce no smoke&mdash;all cooking happened on top of
steel slabs that had had Heat Metal cast on them, and so on.)
</p>

<p>
Allison had been read in&mdash;we'd had to; she kept asking snide
questions until we explained what was going on&mdash;and we were back
to our discussion.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, so, let's assume that we killed ninety percent of Afi's little
MiniMe's with our Mega Water Dragon of Doom No Jutsu," I said,
ignoring the strange looks I got at the name.  "That means there were
about six hundred of them making sacrifices.  Six hundred sacrifices
per round is..."&mdash;some quick figuring; I'd never been good at
mental math but it was easier with my Brain-v2.0&mdash;"one and a
quarter million secrets in the three and a half hours they had, as
compared to our one hundred thousand.  If every single
Gr&#491;fhamrite goes through the ritual once, Afi will still have a
one-third stake in what Herr&uacute;n comes out like.  That about
right?"
</p>

<p>
"Wow, you're screwed," Allison said.  "Any chance I could get you to
release my binding so I can go home before you all get killed?"
</p>

<p>
Colborn shot her a glare but said nothing.
</p>

<p>
"Plus, he may have more Ice Assassins on the way here any time,"
Albrecht put in.
</p>

<p>
"Drifa," I asked, turning to her.  "I know you said we couldn't, but
just to check&mdash;there's absolutely no way that we can move the
ritual, or start it up somewhere else while it's going on here, then
stop this one?"
</p>

<p>
She shook her head decisively, the very image of a grizzled veteran
politely refusing a stupid order from a green looie.  "Regretfully
Your Majesty, no.  This ritual is pulling the fragments of the Lady to
this spot; a second ritual elsewhere would just be fighting the pull.
It would also be starting completely over in order to build up the
same 'pull' that we've achieved so far.
</p>

<p>
"Also," she continued after a moment.  "Any significant pause in the
ritual&mdash;more than a round or two, I'd guess&mdash;would cause it
to fail.  Einarr and I cobbled this ritual together from scraps of
information and our best guesses; quite frankly, it's slapdash and
fragile.  Most rituals have been refined over generations; they're
efficient and effective, like a scalpel.  This one is leaking power
all over the place and we're making up for it with sheer brute force.
It's a sledgehammer, and it's just as hard to redirect once it gets
going."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht cocked his head in thought.  "The ritual is pulling the
Lady's fragments to <em>this spot</em>, or to the altars?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Drifa paused.  "Honestly, I'm not sure.  Certainly to the altars, but
I just don't know if the physical location is relevant."
</p>

<p>
"Give me your best guess," Albrecht demanded.
</p>

<p>
Drifa grimaced, but thought about it.  "Well...<em>probably</em> the
physical location isn't critical.  It's the altars that define the
locus; that said, moving the altars just isn't practical so it amounts
to the same thing."  She paused, then added.  "We could have people
sacrifice multiple secrets per pass, though.  The number of secrets
per person or per round isn't important, just that the flow
continues."
</p>

<p>
Thomas faced me.  "This would be a really good time for you to come up
with one of your tricks, Jake," he told me frankly.  "Without Lady
Herr&uacute;n on our side, we're going to lose this war eventually.  I
don't see how we can possibly hold off Afi for four days, and he's
certain to notice the problem before then.  Once he does, he'll show
up and we're all dead."
</p>

<p>
I grimaced.  "Yeah, thanks.  No pressure."  I stopped to think, and
everyone waited.
</p>

<p>
I closed my eyes, cleared my mind, and focused on my breathing,
forcing myself to relax.  <em>~Fear is the mindkiller,~</em> I thought
to myself with an inward twist of amusement.  "<em>~Fear is the little
death that only cowards suffer.  I will permit it to pass over me and
through me, and then I will kick it righteously in the ass.~</em>" The
mangled Bene Gesserit mantra didn't help, but the humor did; I could
feel myself relaxing.
</p>

<p>
Ok, if we had people start sacrificing multiple secrets per pass we
could outbid Afi...assuming we could finish the ritual and have
everyone do their sacrifices.  Problem: we didn't have time for that.
We needed some way to get people out from under the hammer and still
finish the ritual.
</p>

<p>
I visualized the ritual and its surroundings; the flames, the people
racing past it.  Six altars, twelve Gr&#491;fhamr nodes on the walls,
a steady stream of people running in both directions.  We could move
the nodes easily enough; could we get all the people who had already
sacrificed into one set of them, so that we could save at least some
of the people?  That didn't seem terribly practical; we were moving
people between the nodes as fast as possible and packing them in.
</p>

<p>
Hm.  Actually, we <em>could</em> fit all of them in one node, if we
stacked the expansion spells.  Put Rope Tricks inside Rope Tricks and
you could fit an arbitrary number of people.  Problem was, that was
crazy dangerous.  If Rope Trick Alpha contained Rope Trick Beta and
Alpha expired while there were still people in Beta, what would
happen?  My guess was that the people in Beta would be permanently
stranded.  Even if it were safe, we'd have to significantly alter the
flow of people in order for everyone with sacrifices made to all end
up in a single set of nodes, and that might cause enough of a slowdown
to disrupt the ritual.  And we couldn't relocate all the nodes without
giving up on the ritual.
</p>

<p>
I rolled my mental viewpoint down through the memory of the ravine,
examining the walls, the floor, and the altars themselves.  Could we
pick up the altars and relocate them into Gr&#491;fhamr?  No, then
they would be on a different plane and supposedly Herr&uacute;n
couldn't 'hear' them.  She had managed to reach me while I was in
Gr&#491;fhamr, but that was in a 'potential dream', and I wasn't going
to bet against Drifa's professional opinion.
</p>

<p>
Hm.  'Pick them up.' Something about that idea seemed promising.
</p>

<p>
My eyes popped open and I looked at Drifa.  "Just <em>how</em> fragile
is the ritual?  If the altars were physically lifted, would that ruin
it?  Or if we carried them?"
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.  "The ritual depends on each of the altars
reinforcing each other, and its very sensitive.  It would lose
cohesion if the heights of the altars were more than a few inches
different, or if any altar were rotated more than five or ten degrees
out of alignment on any axis."
</p>

<p>
"So, as long as everything were kept completely aligned,
they <em>could</em> be moved?" Colborn asked sharply.
</p>

<p>
Drifa hesitated; when she spoke the words were slow and unwilling.
"In theory, yes, I suppose.  But I doubt it could be done in
practice," she said.  "Even if you were able to keep everything
correct, the flow of sacrifices couldn't stop, or even slow down
appreciably.  Frankly, I'm amazed that it survived the interruptions
when you and Lord Loki made your sacrifices, Jake.  I can only guess
that those were powerful enough secrets to sustain the ritual across
the time gap."
</p>

<p>
"Also, the altars are very heavy," Albrecht put in.  "Several hundred
pounds each, maybe a thousand.  We'd need four bearers of exceptional
strength, and we don't have anyone trained for that; I wouldn't think
untrained bearers could keep it level, at the same relative height and
not turned, while marching.  If they fell out of step, the altar would
pivot or twist.  None of our people could stay that perfectly in step
for long enough to matter."
</p>

<p>
"The Landguard could," Thomas put in.  "When we're stationed in
Capital City, a lot of our duties are ceremonial; we do a lot of
close-order drill for parades and holidays.  Also, one version of
punishment duty consists of carrying the squad leader while he stands
on a shield in full armor; if he wobbles or falls, the Guardsmen in
question get used for targets in the hand-to-hand and archery
practice.  And we're strong enough that one Landguard could lift the
altar, although two or four would be better for balance purposes."
</p>

<p>
I glanced at Thomas in surprise, one eyebrow shooting up.  "'Get used
for targets'?  What does that mea...you know what, never mind.  How
fast could you walk, while keeping everything stable?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not faster than the Dirge March," he told me.  "One step
per second, about five feet per round."
</p>

<p>
"Fifty feet a minute, about half a mile per hour," I calculated
thoughtfully.  "That's not much, but it's something."
</p>

<p>
"If you're as skilled at formation marching as you say, then that
would take care of the horizontal separation," Unn asked dubiously.
"How would you handle sloped ground&mdash;it would cause vertical
separation.  Also, what about leveling?  Here in Anundj&aring; we use
bubble levels, and they won't react fast enough to give the necessary
precision."
</p>

<p>
"We could use a mercury level," I began, then paused.  Where were we
going to get mercury in a medieval tech level?
</p>

<p>
"Not a problem for a competent mage," Colborn interjected with a
derisive sniff.  "Just use Floating Disk; it will take care of keeping
level, they will follow their casters at full movement speed, and
they'll take care of staying level.  We just need to worry about
keeping them at the same height and in alignment with each other, and
that's manageable&mdash;the height of the Disks can be adjusted to be
anything up to three feet off the ground.  As long as we don't have to
go down too steep a slope there won't be an issue."
</p>

<p>
"We'll still need something to keep them level when they're being
picked up to set them on the Disks," Thomas said.  "Punishment drill
doesn't require <em>that</em> degree of precision. What was that
'mercury level' you were talking about?"
</p>

<p>
I was smiling brightly by now; this was going to work!  "Easy peasy.
Put a drop of mercury in the center of a small plate," I told them.
"Put the plate on the altar.  As long as the mercury stays in the
center of the plate, you're fine.  And mercury is the material
component for Floating Disk and it costs less than a gold piece, so
the magi can produce as much as we need from their spell component
pouches."  <em>~And isn't THAT just annoying?  Sure, here, have two
million pounds of mercury!  It's free!~</em> I thought to myself.
</p>

<p>
"Um, excuse me?  May I ask a question?" Suze said, very timidly. At my
nod she continued.  "What about the people doing the sacrifices?  We
don't want everyone outside the city, and if they have to be jumping
up onto the Disks they might bump the altars.  It probably wouldn't
matter, because the altars are so heavy, but it just seems, um,
risky?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht shrugged.  "Good question, but it's manageable.  We can do
the same thing we did for the water cannons: we put the Portable Holes
on vertical sheets and have a squad carry them.  The people step from
one side, onto the Disk, and into the other side."  He paused,
frowning.  "No, we'll need to build a solid frame.  If the substrate
flaps in the breeze or, gods forbid, tips, the gravity will shift
inside the city and someone could get hurt.  That will be another
thing that we'll have to be very careful to keep level."
</p>

<p>
The idea of gravity suddenly flipping ninety degrees throughout the
city was not a pleasant one. I had a sudden vision of the frame with
the Holes getting out of control, flipping over and over down a cliff,
and everyone in the city being tumbled around like that one odd sock
in the dryer.  It was not a pretty picture and, based on everyone
else's expression, I think they were all sharing it.
</p>

<p>
Eventually though, we got past it.  Everyone looked around the table
at each other, checking to see if anyone saw any other problems.  When
no one said anything I clapped my hands and said "I love it when a
plan comes together!  No time like the present.  Albrecht, have
someone find a new location for us. Thomas, if you and the Landguard
can go get started on moving the altars...."
</p>

<p>
"Yeah, about that..." Loki said.  "We need to talk."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed.  And hopefully this conversation won't be as rude as the
last," Afi chimed in.
</p>

<p>
Thomas and Alpha Squad blurred forward, blades in hand and I heard
the <em>bong!</em> from Robert's direction as he shut down all magic.

</p>
<p>
"In a society without death, Ingfred is 20 years old and has no
prospects. All the good jobs are filled by undying masters of their
craft, and it's hard to be taken seriously when you are, compared to
everyone around you, an infant.  Fortunately, he has a solution:
undergo an illegal transformation and sell the memory to The
Experiental Herald for a ridiculous sum.
</p>

<p>
There's two problems: how can Ingfred convince a powerful wizard to
risk his mage license and his freedom to help with such a crazy plan?
And, once that's done...how will Ingfred deal with the law?"
