<p>
I simply sat there, stunned.  Behind me, conversation broke out in
quiet, angry hisses.  The Archpriest and his minions were furious with
the Landguard for striking the Archpriest and then holding them all at
sword point. The Landguard were furious with the Archpriest and his
minions for making it necessary.  Reynard was trying to mediate while
Isaac pompously discoursed on the appropriate way to handle the
Deorsi's ultimatum.
</p>

<p>
After a long minute the shock drained out of me, leaving only wildfire
rage.  I pushed myself to my feet and forced my way through the crowd
to the Archpriest, shoving Hierophants, High Priests, and burly
Landguard out of my way as I did.  The Landguard parted to let me
through, then pressed close around me, leaving just enough room to be
able to fight if need be.
</p>

<p>
I got right up in the Archpriest's face; I was several inches taller
than he, and I deliberately loomed, using my height for dominance.
</p>

<p>
"What exactly is your damage, you moronic little prig?!  You violated
a parley and nearly got us all <em>killed</em>!  If you ever try
something like that again, I will have you defrocked and thrown into
the lowest dungeon I possess for the remainder of your goddamn life.
If I don't possess a dungeon, I will by god have one built.  Do you
understand me?"
</p>

<p>
He put his hands on my chest and physically pushed me back, his face
growing red and his eyes flashing with rage. "How dare you speak to me
like that?!  Do you have the slightest idea the horror that that
monster was discussing so casually?  People are meant to die after
their allotted span, then to rest in the arms of the True God, safe in
eternal bliss!  That is the natural order; to change it is an
abomination!"
</p>

<p>
"Bullshit!  You resurrected me after the Deorsi attacked.  In fact,
you were perfectly willing to resurrect that dock worker, Leon, if it
meant preserving your own political power on the Conclave.  Where was
your 'natural order' then, hm?  Or is it only an abomination when
someone else does it, you self-aggrandizing hypocrite?"  I was too
angry to choose my words, and the hot rage poured out like lava.
</p>

<p>
He was so angry his face had gone beyond red to chalk white, and he
was physically shaking.  "I will see you destroyed for this.  The
ruler's power may be absolute in theory, but in practice the people
will follow their Church.  Your Landguard myrmidons can't protect you
from the common man, and that is exactly who I will raise against
you."
</p>

<p>
I laughed right in his face.  "Go for it.  Take your best shot.  But
you better pull it off the first time, or I will disassemble your
pathetic church brick by brick.  I don't like gods.  I don't like
churches.  In my world there is no God and I consider organized
religion to be the most damaging thing ever invented by human beings,
up to and including nuclear weapons.  In this world, where there
clearly <em>are</em> gods, I don't consider them much better.  So go
on, give me an excuse.  Just one excuse."  The Landguard pressed close
behind me, swords raised and death in their eyes.  Had I been just a
tad less furious, I would have realized that paladins are soldiers of
their gods and it might not be the best idea to lay out my contempt
for religion quite so plainly around them.  Fortunately, it didn't
matter; they were just as furious that the Archpriest had violated the
parley as I was.
</p>

<p>
The Archpriest was still shaking with anger as he snapped back.  "You
think you can stop me, your arrogant little snot?  You've
alienated <em>everyone</em> since coming here.  The Landguard are your
only true followers, and they are sworn to protect the common man.  If
I raise the people against you, they will have no choice but to stand
by as we drag you into the streets and <em>hang you</em>, you
self-important nothing!"
</p>

<p>
A glacial wind swept over the lava in my brain, freezing it in jagged
spires of ice. From within that ice, I stared at him for ten seconds
with a look that promised death.  When he opened his mouth to start in
on the threats again I cut him off. "Shut it," I ordered, stepping
forward and laying a hand on his shoulder to interrupt his chain of
thought.
</p>

<p>
It worked; mid-syllable, he stopped talking.  I tightened my grip on
his shoulder, pressing my thumb into his collarbone to fix his
attention as I leaned in, intruding on his personal space and forcing
him back on his heels.  My voice was soft and very carefully
enunciated as I laid out the future for him.
</p>

<p>
"Archpriest Michael.  Five minutes ago, you nearly destroyed this
country.  It is barely conceivable that we can stop the current Deorsi
army.  If we were to kill their commander during a parley, they would
send in enough troops to rip this nation down stone by stone.  At the
very best, every citizen of Flobovia would have been conscripted into
their army and sent to die fighting monsters, assuming they weren't
made slaves or something worse.
</p>

<p>"It might interest you to know that in my world there is a group
called 'Buddhist monks.'  These men do not believe in violence and so,
in order to protest great injustice, some of them have burned
themselves alive in order to become martyrs.  They have accomplished
great political change by doing this, and all without hurting anyone
else; quite a remarkable achievement, wouldn't you agree? From now on,
you will support me with your utmost effort and every resource at your
disposal.  You will take no action that could interfere with our truce
with the Deorsi, or with how I choose to proceed when it ends.  Should
you fail in that duty, I will allow you the honor of causing great
political change.  Do you fully and completely comprehend my meaning
or am I being too nuanced for you?"  
</p>

<p>
I stared him in the eyes, waiting a long beat to see if he would call
me on my threat.  He must have been smart enough to realize that I
wasn't kidding; in that moment of rage, I was cold enough to do
exactly what I threatend.  The anger and, yes, terror, at what had
just happened had blown straight through my moral filters.
</p>

<p>
Finally, when it was clear that he would not call me out, I turned
away and set off back to the castle, my stride long and quick in my
anger.  "Come on, Thomas, let's see if we can salvage anything from
this mess."  Thomas, the Archmagi, and the Cuirassiers fell in behind
me in silence.  The Archpriest and his minions stayed behind, glaring
daggers at my back.
</p>

<p>
A few blocks later, Thomas moved up to walk beside me, leaving the
others a couple paces behind.  "You know that carrying out that threat
would be a disaster, don't you?" he asked me softly.  "If tomorrow you
order us to do it, we will.  But the day after that we'll have a civil
war, and the Deorsi will conquer us all."
</p>

<p>
"I honestly don't give a damn at this point.  Maybe I will after I
cool off, but I doubt it.  I don't like organized religion to start
with, and that man is jumping up and down on my last nerve with his
'natural order' crap.  If he screws with me, or with the Deorsi, burn
him to ash."
</p>

<p>
He winced but said only, "Yes, My Lord."
