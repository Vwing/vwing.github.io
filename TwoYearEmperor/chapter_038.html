</p>
<p>
Duncan ripped me out of the arms of the wight and stabbed it in the
face.
</p>

<p>
I writhed on the ground where he had thrown me, screaming from the
freezing/burning agony where the creature had ripped my side open
with its filthy teeth and sucked out most of my lifeforce.
</p>

<p>
Robert sheathed his left-side blade, bent down and hoisted me up with
one hand.  He threw me over his shoulder and stepped forward five
feet. In a sane world he would have been able to start running
immediately...but this was Flobovia (well, Deor) or, as I had started
calling it, "Stupidworld", and this place did not even live on the
same landmass as a sane world.  Robert had taken two move actions and
a five foot step in the last six seconds and so, under Stupidworld's
bizarre physics, he had exhausted his actions for the round and
couldn't move.
</p>

<p>
Franklin dropped both swords, scooped us up in his arms bridal style,
and accelerated off like Frankie Fredericks smashing the 10-second
barrier.  Thomas, Duncan, and the members of Alpha Squad slammed into
place around us, slashing monsters aside like an out of control
buzzsaw.  Battlemagic erupted in all directions from Landguard with
mage and cleric levels (which was most of them).  They lay down a
barrage of death and mutilation around us so intense that within
seconds there were no living&mdash;er, unliving&mdash;enemies within
fifty feet. The remainder came surging in, but the brief respite gave
us a critical instant to regroup and reposition. Landguard snapped
into formation around me in a reverse explosion of perfectly fluid
movement, and another wave of mystical and physical attacks mauled the
first three ranks of attackers.  Fried, blasted, and shredded enemy
bodies hit the ground as ash and meat shards.  The outer ring of
Landguard bellowed 'BURN!', their holy symbols lighting up like
miniature suns as the power of their faith vaporized the nearest
undead.
</p>

<p>
The Landguard in full fury were a terrifying sight; the area around us
was a hellstorm of spells and holy power, all backed up by razor sharp
blades and mystically enhanced strength that could slash a small tree
in half with one blow.  There were only three dozen Landguard around
me&mdash;the others had all been separated from us when we teleported
into the sea of monsters&mdash;but those three dozen were killing
hundreds of enemies every round, and continually burning others to ash
with the sheer strength of their belief.  I have never in my entire
life been so grateful for the existence of religion as I was at that
moment.
</p>

<p>
None of it mattered.
</p>

<p>
There were just too many of the enemy, and they couldn't be killed
fast enough.  Every round, one or two got past the Landguards' blades
and spells and Turn Undead power and bit or clawed at one of us.  The
mystically enhanced Landguard armor shrugged off most of the attacks
but every so often one would find exposed flesh and eat a tiny portion
of its target's lifeforce.  After every such hit, that Landguard would
strike more weakly and hit less often.  We were being inexorably
whittled down.
</p>

<p>
Precisely six seconds after we started running, Franklin dropped
Robert and shifted to the side, raising his holy symbol to vaporize a
group of undead who had bulled through the line.  His actions
refreshed by the new round, Robert landed on his feet and started
running without missing a step.  Moments later, Bob and Aerith dropped
Franklin's swords in his hands and slotted in next to him, their
blades gleaming in the weak, cloud-filtered sunlight as they
slaughtered anything that got past his Turn Undead ability.
</p>

<p>
When Robert hit the ground, the impact slammed my wounded side into
his unyielding armored shoulder and ripped my wound further open.  I
screamed so loud I tasted blood, and the molten agony in my side
blotted out the world, leaving me with only fragmentary sense
impressions:
</p>

<p>
<em>A Landguard head bouncing off my back and rolling away.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Blood fountaining from the throat of a black-haired Landguard I
didn't know.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>A Landguard woman with a long-healed scar on her cheek screaming
as zombie wolves tore her leg off.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Thomas slashing three wights apart, but the fourth sliding under
his blades and clawing his calf to shreds.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Wraiths rising up from the ground a few yards in front of us,
barring our way; the Landguard cutting them to ectoplasmic shreds
without breaking stride.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>A dozen wraiths leaping out of the ground at her feet and tearing
the life from Olivia. Seconds later, there is another wraith where she
had stood; its head swivels towards us and it begins floating in
pursuit.</em>
</p>

<p>
My wound felt as though icy roaches were chewing their way through my
body, clawing and biting chunks from my soul as they went.  I screamed
and screamed; there was no thought of keeping calm in order to be
useful or of preserving my dignity...there was no thought at all, only
shrieking animal protest against the horrific agony that was far
beyond anything I had ever imagined could exist.
</p>

<p>
A hand slapped onto the wound and squeezed the edges together; my
lungs practically collapsed at the massive spike of pain.  "Lay On
Hands," said a voice made distant by the wall of torment between my
shattered mind and the outside world. Golden warmth surged through me,
reality obediently rearranged itself, and my flesh was whole again.
The icy tearing pain in my soul was still there, but a second hand
came down on my back and another voice said "Restoration."  If I
hadn't been being carried like a dignity-less sack of potatoes I would
have collapsed at the sudden absence of brain-melting torture.  The
hands vanished as the casters shifted their focus back to running and
fighting.  I would never know who they had been.
</p>

<p>
My guardians shouted and walls sprang into existence on both sides of
us; force and stone and iron and more, forming a corridor of relative
safety that let us run mostly unmolested.  Moments later the iron wall
to our left crashed to the ground as a dozen zombie elephants slammed
into it full force.  A flood of wights and wraiths and shadows
followed in their wake.  Ahead of us, other walls exploded, shimmered
out of existence, or simply collapsed into dust.
</p>

<p>
Something rotten and flyblown broke through the line at Robert's six
o'clock and charged.  I cried a warning but Robert was busy with an
attacker in front of him, and reacted just a little too slowly.  The
monster&mdash;whatever it was&mdash;lunged, thrusting with a shard of
broken-off sword.  The blade was less than a foot from my face when
Aerith threw himself in the way, taking a deep cut across his chest as
he diverted the blade.  He ignored the blood gushing from his wound to
kick the monster's feet out from under it and cut it in half before it
could hit the ground.
</p>

<p>
A company of decaying giant corpses lurched up from the cover of a
small hillock.  Enormous crossbows sent missiles only slightly smaller
than ballista bolts blasting through our ranks like a hail of
thunderbolts.  Three of them bounced off their targets, but eight more
pinned their victims to the earth like butterflies to a mounting
board.  We stampeded past without slowing; two Landguard dropped out
of formation to make sure we didn't catch any more bolts in the back.
Even I knew that they wouldn't be rejoining us.  
</p>

<p>
A swarm of disembodied saw-toothed jaws limned in putrescent green
fire danced through the edges of the Landguard perimeter and struck at
Franklin, clamping on like sharks and tearing giant gobbets of flesh
from his face and arms.  He didn't make a sound and never lost his
focus.  He continued to blast undead apart with his faith even as his
body was pulled apart under him.
</em>
</p>


<p>
A swarm of arrows worthy of the Persians at Thermopylae darkened the
sky above us. Robert instantly took a knee and three Landguard threw
themselves over me, their bodies soaking up dozens of hits.  Most of
the arrows rattled off their armor like rain off a tin roof, but some
lanced into vulnerable flesh.  With a grunt, all four surged to their
feet, not bothering to remove the arrows before racing on.
</p>

<p>
To my left, someone said "Fog Cloud" in that distinctive tone that
meant reality should sit down and shut up because the grownups were
talking.  Vision faded as clouds billowed forth, wrapping us in misty
fingers.  Less than a minute later, a wind picked up and tore the
concealing cloud to tatters, scouring it away and leaving us exposed
again under the leaden overcast sky.
</p>


<p>
It wasn't until a few seconds after that that I managed to pull myself
together and start really thinking again.  It was hard to see what was
happening while draped face down over Robert's armored shoulder,
especially as I was bouncing around as he twisted and dodged through
the forest of grasping shadowy claws that rose up from the ground
without warning to rend his legs and feet.  Despite that, I managed to
curl my body up enough to get a look around.  Most of my vision was
blocked by the ever-shrinking wall of Landguard around me, but through
the occasional gap I could see that there was no visible end to the
enemy.  Undead carpeted the plains like army ants for as far as I
could see from this position.
</p>

<p>
First step: get a better position.  I contorted myself so that I could
latch my arms around Robert, one over his left shoulder and one under
his right.  He sensed what I was doing and eased his grip so that I
could awkwardly flop over and around, wrapping my legs around his
waist until I was riding piggyback, his Haversack trapped between us.
With his left hand freed of supporting me, he drew his second blade,
cutting down an attacker with a precise iajutsu strike that left it
headless and flopping.
</p>

<p>
From here I could see better, which was not a terribly comforting
thing since the news got worse the more I looked around.  The
Landguard were slicing through zombies, wights, wraiths, and shadows
like a chainsaw through tissue paper, but the enemy was reacting
intelligently, deploying more powerful undead against us and lining up
missile- and caster troops.  From our front left, a platoon of
monstrosities was vectoring to intercept us: minotaurs with the
glowing red eyes and elongated canine teeth that screamed 'vampire'.
I was guessing they were casters, probably clerics by the strange
glowing medallions around their necks and the brain-melting words
pouring from their rotting lips.
</p>

<p>
The Landguard saw them coming and broke right, but the creatures cut
the chord, and they had started far enough ahead that the Landguard
didn't quite have the speed to pass them by before being intercepted.
I caught a glimpse of Thomas's face.  For a split second I saw a flash
of despair before he locked it away under his professional mask; the
brief sight would have scared me down to my shoes, were I still
capable of fear.  I started fumbling in my trenchcoat, twisting and
struggling to get a hand down to where my ribcage was pinned against
Robert's backpack.
</p>

<p>
The minotaur vampires were almost on us by the time I managed to rip
one of the cloth patches off my coat lining and heave it towards them.
The small bit of iron stitched to the inside gave it just enough
weight to carry past the Landguard to our attackers.
</p>

<p>
Just as it was about to pass out of range, I yelled
"Cannon-Alpha-Alpha-Golf-Grow!" and seven hundred pounds of iron and
oak slammed into the lead vampire.  He and his cohorts went down like
tenpins, their ribcages cracking under the impact.  Within seconds the
topmost vampire heaved the cannon aside, staggered back to its feet,
and came after us again, rapidly followed by its brethren.
Fortunately, I had bought just enough time; while the enemy was down,
the Landguard had raced past and their greater speed was opening the
distance fast.
</p>

<p>
The Landguard who had originally been separated from us were slicing
through the hordes of monstrosities like a motorboat through choppy
seas to get to us.  Men and women were dying left and right as they
came, pulled down by wraiths clutching from the ground or mobs of
wights and zombies hurling themselves on their victims' warm living
bodies with reckless abandon. The Landguard never slowed; anyone who
fell or even dropped behind was abandoned in the singleminded focus to
get to me.  More and more were arriving by the moment, thickening the
barrier between my tender flesh and the rampaging hordes of unliving
abominations.  The wraith hands that reached up from the ground as we
passed were still a problem, but the lead Landguard elements were
soaking up the damage and slashing them apart, clearing the way as we
ran.
</p>

<p>
Something that looked vaguely like an eagle with the wingspan of a 747
smashed into the ground in front of us.  It was very clearly dead long
before it hit the ground&mdash;probably months before, based on the
worms dripping from its decomposing flesh.  Fortunately, it was not
moving.  It was also burning like a torch, which might have had
something to do with the 'not moving.'
</p>

<p>
"All squads, light 'em up!" Albrecht shouted from above and in front
of us; a full spread of attack spells lanced down from the sky.  Fire
bloomed in spheres the size of a small house, flash-frying anything
they caught.  Lightning danced across the battlefield, turning the
undead into convulsing meatpuppets before dropping them in windrows.
Stranger effects burst undead bodies asunder, sank them in muddy pits,
or sent them sliding off their feet as the ground below them became a
slick mass of whale blubber.
</p>

<p>
In launching their attack, Albrecht and his carpet-riding magi had
broken their protective invisibility.  That was all that the liches on
the hill needed; black tentacles erupted from the flying carpets,
seizing the magi thereon and constricting like rubbery snakes.
Immobile, the magi could not cast to protect themselves from the
followup swarm of glowing black knives that swirled through the
writhing tentacles to slam unerringly into faces, arms, bodies.  The
magi jerked and screamed in pain, and more than one died.  Two of them
even had their heads literally removed as all the knives slashed
directly into their necks, severing them cleanly.  Gore fountained
everywhere, soaking their companions and raining down on us.  The
coppery iron smell of blood saturated my nostrils so heavily I was
sure I'd never get it out.
</p>

<p>
Thomas swore sulphorously in five languages, then bellowed "Aerith,
mage defense!"  The young soldier with the strange name tapped his
blades together and antimagic rolled out around us in a circle of
mundanity.  All the nearest wraiths gave an angry scream that was cut
off mid-note as the antimagic squeezed them out of this existence.
</p>

<p>
Good news: the undead casters couldn't hurt us, the wraiths and
shadows and ghosts couldn't attack us from underground (or anywhere
else in range of the antimagic field), and none of our enemies could
use their life drain powers on us.  Caloo, callay, oh, the excitement.
</p>

<p>
Bad news: the Landguard in the outer group were not so protected, and
almost immediately started to take more and more casualties from
opposing casters.  Even worse (if that was possible), all of my
immediate protectors had their enhancements and magic items shut
off. Their blazing speed was gone, leaving us moving at little more
than a plodding jog as the weight of armor, gear, wounded comrades,
and one gleeful ruler suddenly became relevant.  Their superhuman
strength and the magical enhancements to their blades and armor
ceased, meaning that cutting down the enemy became far harder and more
of the enemies' hits landed.  The Landguard with mage or cleric levels
couldn't use spells to destroy great swaths of attackers or heal
wounds.  Nor could they use their Turn Undead ability to obliterate
undead with a glance while keeping a safe distance.  We were forced
back on steel and regular human muscle against apparently limitless
swarms of undying horrors.
</p>

<p>
Without further orders, my pefectly trained bodyguards shifted
position; the bulk of them crowded in close, getting under the
protection of the antimagic.  A thin shell remained just outside,
using their magical enhancements to ensure that the bulk of the
attackers died before coming close enough to attack us.  The merely
human skills and strength of the Landguard inside the protective
circle were enough to handle the leakers.
</p>

<p>
Every time a Landguard on the outer rim died, one from the inside
would step up to take his place.  Until someone else had to step
forward to fill <em>his</em> place.  Of course, the worst part was
that every time one of them died it just added another soldier to the
enemy's ranks.
</p>

<p>
More horrific images flashed by me, embedding themselves firmly in my
brain:
</p>

<p>
- The one Landguard with his head cut in half from crown to chin by an
axe.
</p>

<p>
- The filth-dripping fangs and horrific hunting scream of a wight that
got way too close before Aerith cut its leg out from under it, taking
a gash in his side in exchange.
</p>

<p>
- The cries of a half dozen Landguard on the perimeter as they were
caught in multiple overlapping Fireballs.  The only thing that hit the
ground was their gear and a few roughly human-shaped blocks of carbon.
</p>

<p>
If I hadn't been so busy clinging to Robert I would have clapped my
hands in glee.  This wasn't the way I'd planned to do it, but they
were dropping like flies!  And it was all completely deniable&mdash;I
had had nothing to do with any of this, so I wouldn't have to worry
about any Inigo Montoya speeches.
</p>

<p>
I don't know how long we were running like that before our protective
antimagic field winked out...only to spring back to existence a moment
later when Thomas bellowed "Rob, mage defense!"
</p>

<p>
An iron wall sprang into existence before us, stretching dozens of
yards to either side; clearly, a gift from some enemy caster who
didn't want us leaving the party just yet.  The Landguard didn't slow;
the first ranks threw themselves to their knees at the base of the
wall, others piling on top to form a human ramp so Thomas, Duncan, and
Alpha Squad could run up and over, dropping twenty feet to the ground
on the far side as the ones left behind scrambled to their feet and
hastened to rejoin us.
</p>

<p>
On and on it went, horror after horror as the Landguard died one after
another in an ultimately doomed effort to protect me.  With the core
group's pace so restricted by the protective antimagic, the Landguard
who were still fully combat capable were forced to hold their own
speed down to match ours, meaning more time in combat and more deaths
that could have been avoided had they been moving at speed.
</p>

<p>
I was delighted.  There would be enough Landguard to get me to our
destination but, by the time we got there, they'd be almost entirely
eliminated.  Perfect.  Hopefully those irritating Archmagi would be
dead too; it would save me the effort of doing it myself.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht's mages, somehow freed from the rubbery black tentacles that
had grappled them, ceaslessly rained fire and destruction on the heads
of anything that got too close.  With our antimagic defense up they
didn't need to worry about friendly fire; fireballs would regularly
bloom within a few yards of us, frying any enemy in the area while the
flames that would have expanded in our direction simply winked out of
existence at the edge of the field.
</p>

<p>
Finally, in some way I couldn't imagine, we carved our way through the
enemy forces to the edge of the mountain that had been our target.
Albrecht's mages swooped low, one of them shouting "PASSWALL!"  A
narrow tunnel appeared before us in the rock and he raced inside,
closely followed by his companions.  From within I heard repeated
cries of "Passwall!  Passwall! Passwall!" and the tunnel grew steadily
deeper.
</p>

<p>
The Landguard threw me and my close-in protectors into the tunnel so
fast that Rob barely managed to drop his antimagic before entering the
mystically supported tunnel.  Once we were inside, the others put
their backs to the mountain and sold themselves dearly to buy us the
time to escape.  It wasn't completely an Alamo; their defensive
semicircle steadily contracted as, one after another, they retreated
inside the tunnel and out of the battle.  Despite the possibility of
escape, it was taking far too long to get them off the field and far
too many of them were being pulled down.
</p>

<p>
Up at the head of the rapidly growing shaft I watched as spell after
spell extended the tunnel in front of us.  Thomas and Alpha Squad
crowded close, anxious to get me as far from the enemy as possible.
The few other Landguard who had so far escaped filled the tunnel
behind us like a cork in a bottle. A steady stream of wraiths swooped
through the ground below our feet, only to rise in the midst of us and
be rapidly cut to ribbons before they could strike.
</p>

<p>
The Passwall spells ran out and the magi resorted to more brute force
methods: "Stone Shape!" "Greater Stone Shape!" "Disintegrate!"
"Transmute Rock to Mud!" The floor of the tunnel became sodden with
thick, heavy mud that sucked at everyone's feet, but we kept moving
forward.  I had tried to get back on my own feet but Robert's wordless
growl kept me clinging to his back as he focused on killing the
wraiths and ghosts that were still rising up from the floor
periodically.
</p>

<p>
Without warning we broke through into a cavern.  It was small, a few
dozen yards across, with stalactites and stalagmites like bared fangs
and the steady drip...drip...drip of stone growing across millenia.
In the center, a stalactite/stalagmite pair had merged into a giant
column of stone that swooped from floor to ceiling in an elegant
curve.  Small rocks laid out around its base emitted blazing white
light, brighter than the brightest day, stabbed my eyes as I entered.
It flooded the entire area and turned the chamber into glittering
glory as it reflected off the water on the walls, the reds and browns
and greens and blues of the stone.
</p>

<p>
The light lanced into the nearest portion of the tunnel; where it
touched, wraiths exploded before they could react.  Those in the
tunnel surged forward, clearing the way for the men and women
following them to escape the army of monsters outside.
</p>

<p>
Minutes passed as Landguard streamed out of the tunnel.  Eventually a
distant voice cried "Dismiss Passwall!" and a horde of Landguard and
one Deorsi mage shot out of the tunnel like a cork from a champagne
bottle, landing in a tangled heap of armor and weapons.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that was bracing!" said Albrecht, smiling and gesturing
expansively.
</p>

<p>
Thomas grabbed him by the jaw and smashed him into the cavern wall so
hard rock shards flew in all directions.  His hand blurred as he
stabbed his dagger a quarter inch into Albrecht's left eyeball,
ripping a scream from the general's throat.
</p>

<p>
Kadja and her squad shot forward, only to be cut into filets by dozens
of furious Landguard.  All the Deorsi mages were slammed to the
ground, helpless under antimagic fields and a horde of Landguard who
were beyond fury.
</p>

<p>
"What. The Fuck. Was That?" snarled Thomas, twisting his dagger just
slightly inside Albrecht's eyesocket to elicit fresh screams.
</p>

<p>
Troops were starting to boil out of a hole in the central column,
wearing a motley array of armor and bearing mismatched weapons. The
Landguard were having none of it; they went through the charging
attackers like a reaper through a wheat field.  Blood and fragments of
bodies flew in all directions.  Moments later, there was a sodden
bloody road leading back to the column and a circle of enraged
Landguard guarding the entryway.  The Deorsi mages who had been
captured earlier were face down, blindfolded, gagged, and bound.
</p>

<p>
"I'll talk, I'll talk, I'll talk..." sobbed Albrecht weakly. 
</p>

<p>
Thomas leaned in close until they were almost nose to nose.  His eyes
were blazing with the fires of Hell as he hissed, "I know."
</p>
