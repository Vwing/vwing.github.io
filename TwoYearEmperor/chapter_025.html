<p>
<em>Special treat for you guys: extra long chapter today.  I
considered breaking it up, but decided it was more fun (and a little
alliterative) to buy bad news in bulk rather than making six weekly
payments of only $19.95.</em>
</p>
<hr />

<p>
The release of tension left me feeling drained; all I wanted to do was
sit, stare at the fire where Allison was perched, and turn my brain
off for a while.  Some mind-candy TV would have been perfect but,
sadly, was not an option, since apparently the only thing the people
in this world used electricity for was flash-frying perfectly innocent
interdimensionally kidnapped monarchs named Jake.
</p>

<p>
Eventually I leaned forward and got on to briefing my loyal minions.
"Well, Loki&mdash;sorry, Trickster.  I need to remember that Loki is
just one of his facets; Suze, could you get me a briefing on Wilgam,
Karash, and any other trickster gods from the area?  It could be
relevant.  Actually, I take that back.  Just get me a briefing on all
the local gods.  But focus on the tricksters."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, M'Lord.  You also asked me for a briefing on magic items.  I can
get that, too."
</p>

<p>
I nodded.  "That would actually be perfect.  I need to know if a
particular item exists hereabouts."
</p>

<p>
She nodded, got up, and left the room.
</p>

<p>
"Anyway, Trickster showed up, froze time, and we had a long talk."  I
frowned.  "Which, now that I think about it, surprises me a lot.  The
Time Stop spell only freezes time for 2-5 rounds, and that's only
12-30 seconds.  We talked for probably fifteen or twenty minutes."
</p>

<p>
Thomas shrugged.  "First off, he's a god.  Second off, talking is a
free action so it takes no time.  The two of you could have discussed
the entire history of the world from start to finish and it would
still have fit in one round."
</p>

<p>
I gawped at him, then put my head in my hands and shook it back and
forth.  "I hate this world so very much," I whimpered.
</p>

<p>
Every single one of the Landguard started laughing at me.  Bastards.
</p>

<p>
Eventually I picked my head up and sighed.  "Fine, whatever.  Your
world is totally broken, film at eleven.  Let's get back to it.  All
of you, sit."
</p>

<p>
They didn't jump to it, but they took their seats.  As they were
settling, Thomas gave them all a speaking glance and a slight nod;
none of them sheathed their blades, and they all sat on the edge of
their chairs, weight still on the balls of their feet.  
</p>

<p>
Apparently Thomas was feeling that mother-henning instinct again.
Joy.  I had so enjoyed our intimate moments in the bathroom, and I was
delighted at the sudden surety that it would become a regular
experience.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, while we wait for Suze with the full briefing, I've got a couple
of questions."  I took a deep breath and steeled myself.  I really,
really did not want to have to admit this, but it was necessary. "The
High Priest literally moved heaven and earth to bring me back to life,
and then I cursed him out, threatened to defrock him and imprison him.
Which might not have been exactly the most optimal course of action."
</p>

<p>
"Don't forget the part where you threatened to 'disassemble his
pathetic church brick by brick,' M'Lord," Robert added helpfully.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, right," Aerith added, his tone equally 'helpful'.  "And the part
where you told him that organized religion was the most damaging thing
ever invented by human beings.  That was good too."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Aerith, for your valuable input," I told him with biting
sarcasm.
</p>

<p>
Of course Bob had to put his two copper pieces in. "Ooh, and there was
the part where you directly ordered the Commander to 'burn him to ash'
if he interfered with anything.  A masterpiece of decisive leadership,
M'Lord."
</p>

<p>
Rob wasn't about to be left out of the fun either.  "Of course, I'm
sure he appreciated you taking his family hostage.  That's sure to
have wiped out any minor irritation he had about the rest of it."  He
nodded, pleased with his helpfulness.
</p>

<p>
I took a deep breath and reminded myself that, (a) they were wearing
armor with gorgets so it was physically impossible to strangle them,
and (b) every single one of them could kill me with his pinky.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, well, thank you for those helpful reminders.  Clearly, I screwed
up and it be time to pay the fiddler.  The dressing down happened in
public, so the apology better be in public as well." I grimaced as
though I'd just bitten a lemon.  I seriously did not want to do this;
however much it turned out I owed this man, he really, really pissed
me off.  But, I owed him a debt.  Speaking of which....
</p>

<p>
"I'll make the apology in front of the Conclave.  But an apology isn't
going to be enough, I need to come up with some action to back it up,
and I have no idea what would be appropriate.  Any suggestions?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas shrugged.  "You could kick the Dark Lady off the Conclave, that
would make him pretty happy, and the minor churches don't really have
the influence to hurt you."
</p>

<p>
I seriously considered that for a second, then shook my head.  "No, I
made a deal with her.  Going back on it would be a short-term positive
to the Archpriest issue, but a long-term negative in general.  Being
known as untrustworthy makes it hard to get anything done.  Is there
anything he cares about that we could throw money at?  Does he want
any titles, land, government support for a pet project?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," Aerith put it, clearly thinking out loud. "I think he's a book
collector.  He made a passing comment once about going to an estate
auction because they had a first edition copy of <em>De
Daemonibus</em> by Rupert Selig."
</p>

<p>
I nodded, pleased.  "Ok, great, let's get as many rare old books as we
can.  We'll give him the originals, build a library of the copies and
dedicate it to him.  What else?"
</p>

<p>
There was a long silence as everyone tried to come up with something
else, with about as much success as the Fundamentalist movement trying
to convert Richard Dawkins.
</p>

<p>
"Commander, what about his nephew?" Franklin stammered.  The poor kid
looked wildly uncomfortable to be speaking up.  I gave him props for
having the stones.
</p>

<p>
Thomas quirked an eyebrow and looked at his juniormost 'Guard.  "What
about him?  For that matter, who is he?"
</p>

<p>
"Jason Liandola-Marcen, sir.  Son of his sister, who married that elf
merchant over in Tarisia.  He was at the reception for that trade
conference two years ago, and I heard him talking to some of his
friends. Sounds like the kid's been soldier crazy all his life.  He's
fifteen, and he's already tried to get into the Tarisian military
twice, but they rejected him until he hits majority.  We could offer
him a place at the next intake."
</p>

<p>
Thomas frowned.  "Intake is not a door prize to be traded around for
political favors."
</p>

<p>
I looked back and forth, confused.  "Someone want to clue the guy on
the hotseat in on what the heck you're talking about?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas turned back to me.  "The Landguard have an intake test every
year when we're under numbers.  We typically get thirty or forty
thousand applicants, of whom we allow two hundred into intake.  We
typically get two, maybe three Landguard out of each intake.  And I am
not taking the kid just as a political bargaining chip, period.  The
Writ lays out the rules for the Landguard and it boils down to 'The
Commander makes the call on who gets in.'  I am not letting my unit be
degraded just because you lost your temper."  The last was said with
the finality of a slamming door.
</p>

<p>
I nodded, holding up my hands in a placating gesture.  "Ok, fair
enough.  I wouldn't expect you to just give the kid membership.  But
can you at least let him be one of the intake?  You don't need to give
him special treatment, but give him the same chance that everyone else
in the intake gets."
</p>

<p>
Thomas's entire face frowned, and he opened his mouth to say what I
was pretty sure what was going to be a refusal, but Duncan cut in.
"Go ahead, Commander," he said, leaning forward and leaning his elbows
on his knees.  "I'll make sure to give the kid...special attention.
If he can hang, he'll be worth it."  He grinned that evil shark grin
that I had come to associate with very large degrees of pain and a
trip to the healer.
</p>

<p>
Thomas's frown shifted into simple disgust. "Fine," he said
grudgingly.  "He's in the intake.  But we do it subtly.  Send someone
to suggest to him, discreetly, that he should apply.  If he does,
he'll be one of the ones that gets in.  But, Duncan&mdash;hammer him.
He better be something goddamn amazing to make the grade.  I'm not
having any rumor that he got in on favoritism, so it better be
totally, crystal, extra-clean clear that he made it in on merit."
</p>

<p>
Duncan nodded, with that evilly gleeful expression that is usually
only possessed by the Evil Overlord's main minion right before he does
something horrible that bumps the movie up one rating.  I looked
around, "Ok, books, library, nephew.  I'll even promise him support on
a couple of Conclave votes.  What else?"
</p>

<p>
A knock on the door interrupted the brainstorming.  
</p>

<p>
I raised an eyebrow but called out.  "Come i&mdash;" I was cut off by
Thomas coming to his feet, one hand raised in a 'stop' gesture.  There
was no perceptible signal that I saw, but suddenly he and Duncan were
at the door, Franklin was yanking me to the floor and flipping my
chair forward so that it covered me from knees to neck.  Even before
the chair hit the floor, Franklin was joining the rest of his squad in
a wall around me.  All of the Landguard had their blades in hand.
</p>

<p>
Duncan took up a position to the side of the door, one blade raised,
ready to cut in half whomever came through should they have the ill
grace to not be friendly...or, you know, if Duncan didn't like the
color of their shoes.  His other blade he held at chest level, ready
to parry any attack that the invader might make.
</p>

<p>
Thomas looked back to check that the rest were set and gave a nod.
Robert tapped his swords together and the familiar ringing spread
across the room, banishing Allison and the Continual Flame torches
again.  Once again the room descended into near darkness, deep shadows
dancing around as the flames flickered and danced in the fireplace,
left over from where Allison had been chowing on the apple tree logs.
</p>

<p>
Seeing that everything was in place, Thomas pulled the door open a
crack, bracing himself to hold the door shut if anyone tried to ram it
open.
</p>

<p>
Pinned as I was, with a wall of Landguard in front of me, I could
barely raise my head enough to see anything, but I heard a cool
contralto voice inquire dryly, "May I come in without being skewered,
Commander?  I have some intelligence that His Lordship needs to have.
It's somewhat urgent."
</p>

<p>
Thomas hesitated, but finally let the woman in.  She was medium height
and utterly forgettable: medium brown hair, medium skin tone, medium
build.  She was clad in brown leathers that blended with the shadows
better than pure black would have; black would have shown her as a
silhouette, darker than the shadows, but the brown simply vanished.
</p>

<p>
As she entered, Duncan grabbed her by the collar, shoved her up
against the wall, and proceeded to give her the same quick frisk that
Thomas had given me earlier.  She took it stoically and when he
finally released her she rolled her eyes, directing a vaguely amused,
vaguely irked glance at him.  "I don't suppose you could teach my
husband that trick, could you?  Might be nice to spice things up a
bit."
</p>

<p>
Duncan grinned, his teeth flashing white in the near-darkness. "I'll
see what I can do.  There's probably a few other tricks I could teach
him, if you like.  How do you feel about rope?"
</p>

<p>
She came right back with acid. "Why, are you going to hang my planters
for me? Do you do windows too?"
</p>

<p>
While the two of them had their little verbal "who's the biggest
alpha" tussle, Alpha Squad was setting the chair aright and helping me
to my feet.  I glared at them, brushed the dust off, and turned to the
woman.  Robert tapped his swords together again and the
lights&mdash;and Allison&mdash;snapped back into existence.
</p>

<p>
Allison promptly lit off like a squad of drunk sailors.  "What in the
name of every devil and daemon and demon and snot spirit in every
layer of the Pit is your problem you braindead lump of festering,
boil-bearing, water-soaked meat?!  Did you not hear the part about
'Don't do that, it friggin' <em>hurts</em>!!'  It's not exactly a
difficult concept, even a meatsack like you should be able to get it
through your walnut brain!  You moronic maggot, your mother&mdash;" She
kept going, getting more profane by the minute, but I tuned her out.
</p>

<p>
"Please, have a seat.  And who might you be, ma'am?" I inquired,
pretty sure I knew the answer.
</p>

<p>
She turned to face me and gave a small nod before moving slowly and
carefully to the chair opposite me.  Thomas stayed about six inches
from her the whole time, in front and slightly to the left where he
could easily restrain her if she tried a physical attack.  Duncan was
behind her to the right, both blades ready to strike at the slightest
hint of trouble.
</p>

<p>
Her savoir faire was amazing; she appeared not to even notice the
paranoia of the elite killers around her.  "I am Alicia Greene, the
Imperial Spymaster, M'Lord. And I've collected some important facts
for you."
</p>

<p>
I raised my eyebrows in polite inquiry.  "Do tell?"
</p>

<p>
She took the seat carefully, leaning back slowly and crossing her legs
as would a man, ankle on knee.  "There's several problems brewing all
at once, M'Lord.  First," she said, ticking off her index finger, "the
Archpriest has been giving sermons lately, which he usually only does
on High Festival.  The sermons are mostly about the True God casting
down the Black King of Tarisia, after that worthy completed his
enlichment ceremony and started killing all the priests."
</p>

<p>
I frowed and leaned forward, raising a hand to interrupt.  "I'm
sorry&mdash;his enrichment ceremony?  What, he was made of uranium?"
</p>

<p>
They never get my references, and she was no exception.  "Enlichment,
M'Lord.  He made himself into a lich.  He was an extremely powerful
wizard and he made himself undead so that he could live forever.  The
ritual is such that only an Evil person would attempt it, so there's
really never been such a thing as a <em>good</em> lich."
</p>

<p>
She shrugged, dismissing the issue.  "The important point, M'Lord, is
that he started killing all the priests in Tarisia in order to prevent
them from using their divine power against him.  The True God took
exception to that, and physically manifested to cast him down.  The
Archpriest is drawing parallels between your actions at the parely and
the Black King's actions after his enlichment."
</p>

<p>
I sighed.  "Actually, we just talked about that.  I'm going to call a
Conclave meeting tomorrow. I'll be apologizing to him and trying to
make it right.  If you have any suggestions on how to do that, I'd
accept them gratefully."
</p>

<p>
She nodded.  "I do, actually.  However, allow me to finish my report.
The Archpriest isn't the only issue."
</p>

<p>
I sighed again, resisting the urge to rub my temples; it would show
too much weakness.  "Please, continue."
</p>

<p>
She nodded brusquely and ticked off her second finger.  "The
Archpriest is one issue, but the Association of Magi is a much bigger
one&mdash;more like a set of issues, actually.  Your policy of forcing
all wizards to share spells with anyone who wanted them has
been...unpopular.  By which I mean, there has been open fighting and
two dozen midlevel magi have died in mage duels.  The Justiciars are
mobilizing to arrest the victors, but it's legally complicated. In
four of the thirteen duels, no civilians were harmed and there was no
property damage, which would normally put the duelists outside of
civil law and make it an internal matter of the Association. But six
of the participants were <em>also</em> involved in the other nine
duels, in which buildings were damaged and eleven civilians were
harmed&mdash;fortunately there was no loss of life.  The duelists are
under civil law for those acts.  But the Association is claiming that
they have prior claim because of the first duels, and are refusing to
allow the Justiciars access."

<p>
She paused for a moment, uncrossing her legs and organizing her
thoughts before continuing. "Lady Justice is taking that refusal in
poor stead, of course.  She's managed to arrest five of the accused
wizards before they reached asylum at the Association Meeting Hall.
Their court panels have already been selected and the trials will
happen first thing tomorrow.  Lady Justice is pushing for the maximum
sentence: level reduction, one level for each person harmed."
</p>

<p>
I saw Robert wince, and even Duncan looked surprised.
</p>

<p>
"What the hell is she thinking?" Duncan growled.  "Level reduction
hasn't been used in over two hundred years!"
</p>

<p>
Alicia glanced at him and shrugged.  "It's still on the books and,
theoretically, it's one of the possible sentences for unconstrained
mage duels that quote, cause harm to city or citizen, unquote.  And
she's <em>pissed</em>; one of my agents overheard her telling her
Deputy that she wants to make an example out of these magi so that the
Association learns its place and stops tearing up the city with its
asinine squabbles.  That's a direct quote, by the way."
</p>

<p>
She turned back to me and continued her report, her voice calm and
disinterested as though she were relating the weather report instead
of an oncoming civil apocalypse.  "The Association, of course, is not
willing to allow level reduction on one of its members.  They feel it
would set a poor precedent, and they're afraid that if it's allowed
against any member then soon it will become standard for all wizarding
infractions.  They've retained a Speaker for the defendants, and most
of the membership is turning out en masse to attend the trial.
There's been no explicit statement that they will fight if the
defendants are sentenced, but I would be more surprised if they
didn't."
</p>

<p>
She tipped her head to one side, eyes on the horizon in thought.  "Of
course, I think some of that overreaction is the recent change in
leadership.  The new Archmagi achieved their rank too quickly; they
don't have a lot of political experience, and they're desperate to
prove themselves to the Association membership." 
</p>

<p>
I blinked.  "Hang on, what change in leadership? I haven't heard
anything about this."
</p>

<p>
She shrugged impassively.  "The wizards who owned the Dedicated
Wrights that you bombed the Deorsi with...between them they wiped out
twenty thousand troops, probably including some mid- and high-level
people.  Of course, they only received a very small fraction of the
experience, since there was no real danger to them, but even that was
enough to catapult Wizards Hall and Cooper up five levels, and Wizard
Nelson went up six. Anyway, they went up enough levels that they
surpassed the existing Archmagi, and therefore took the 'Archmage'
title from them.  The Archmagi are, by definition, the leaders of the
Association, and the new officeholders are, as I said, eager to make
changes to prove themselves.  Add to that the fact that these arenas
of yours have moved a lot of junior mages up into the middle ranks,
and all the political blocs have been destabilized.  Everyone is
scrambling to forge new alliances, and the forging is getting, if
you'll excuse me, a bit heated."  She shrugged.  "Basically, the
Association is in complete chaos."
</p>

<p>
I was on the edge of whimpering, but she just ground mercilessly
onwards.  "And, finally, the One Hundred have just emerged from the
Elfhame.  They're on the Trade Road, and they'll be here sometime in
the next week, depending on how many way station inns they stop at."
</p>

<p>
Every single one of the Landguard groaned.  Thomas actually rested his
head on his hand for a moment, shaking it in disgust.
</p>

<p>
I looked around and felt a faint stirring of concern, much as one
might feel upon being told "There's a pretty good chance you have
cancer.  We'll let you know after the tests come back."
</p>

<p>
I waited for someone to explain, but no one did.  The Landguard were
all mired in negativity, and the Imperial Spymaster was just smiling
faintly at the impact of her news.
</p>

<p>
"Ahem!" I carped.  "And the One Hundred would be...?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas picked up his head with a sigh.  "They're properly called the
Swords of Flame, because their signature weapons are magical fire
swords.  They're a mercenary company&mdash;they've been around about
ten years, and they've built quite a reputation.  Fact is, they're
truly excellent warriors with good equipment, and good discipline on
the battlefield.  Everyone wants them on the field fighting in their
name.  But that's the thing...they want them <em>on the field</em>,
not anywhere nearby.  They aren't bad folks, but they do tend to get a
little rowdy&mdash;" He was interrupted by Duncan muttering something
about 'Maligaw is a little wet.'
</p>

<p>
Thomas paused, shooting a gimlet stare at his Sergeant before
continuing. "Anyway, when they come to town, their Captain does a
Review of the One Hundred at the gates.  Basically, he checks them for
appropriate dress and more-or-less lack of lethal weapons, lectures
them on proper behavior, and turns them loose on the city. The number
of barfights and alleyside duels goes way up, as does the number of
unwed pregnancies. Every time they visit, at least three or four
taverns end up burning down, and there's a regular crimewave of
thefts.  Mostly expensive booze, foods, and pipeweed, but also some
jewels, silks, perfumes, and other things that you might give to a,
ah, 'girlfriend.'"  He didn't quite do the air quotes with his
fingers, but I got the point.
</p>

<p>
Robert groaned.  "And <em>we</em> always get called out to deal with
them, because they're too high level for the regular Guard to deal
with.  Man, last time they were here I was on MP duty.  Cost me three
hundred gold to get everything healed and my back was still aching for
a week."
</p>

<p>
Bob felt the need to throw his hat into the ring of this 'joy-inducing
news' competition.  "Don't forget about the pranks their Nightfigher
element likes to pull," he said with a laugh.  "Those guys are
hilarious."
</p>

<p>
Aerith snickered.  "Remember when they stripped Justiciar Maple to his
skivvies and hung him up on the flagpole in Market Square?  They must
have spelled him to sleep, because he woke up on the pole with no idea
how he got there.  We never did find any proof it was them, but come
on&mdash;it was two days after they came to town, and the morning
before that Maple had two of their infantry thrown in jail for drunk
and disorderly."
</p>

<p>
"Boys can drink though, and their quartermaster makes some damn good
hooch," Duncan offered with fond remembrance.  "I haven't had a
headache that bad in years."
</p>

<p>
Thomas grinned at the memory.  "As I recall, you drank three of their
young bucks under the table.  One after the next.  How much did you
end up making that night?"
</p>

<p>
Duncan grinned right back.  "Couple hundred gold.  They just couldn't
believe that a guy my age could handle his booze."  He snorted in
remembered contempt. "Stupid idjits. I grew up in Three Hills; there
wasn't anything to do there <em>but</em> drink.  I could have put any
one of those punks under the table when I was twelve."

<p>
I had a feeling that the tales of the Hundred's troublemaking and the
Landguard's love/hate relationship with them were going to continue
indefinitely, but fortunately we were rescued by the door opening and
Suze slipping inside.
</p>

<p>
Thomas and Duncan were on their feet and at the door instantly.
Robert and Rob put themselves between me and Suze, while Bob and
Aerith continued to cover Alicia.
</p>

<p>
"Thomas, I don't think Suze is here to assassinate me," I commented
drily.  "I'm pretty sure those are books she's holding, not a dagger.
And I don't think she's been replaced an evil alternate-world
doppleganger: she's missing a goatee."  Thomas looked unconvinced and
I sighed.  "Suze, what was the last thing I said to you before you
left?"
</p>

<p>
"I reminded you you had asked for a briefing on magic items, M'Lord,"
she said, rattled by the Landguard's suspicion. "I asked if you wanted
me to get that too.  And you said yes, that would be perfect, and that
you had a particular item you needed to look up."
</p>

<p>
I looked archly at Thomas and he slowly backed off.  He still didn't
allow Suze close enough to hand the books to me directly.  Instead he
took them from her and passed them to me, guiding her to a seat away
from mine.
</p>

<p>
I shook my head and examined Suze's find.  The first was a thin book
bound in blue leather; the front cover showed a picture of two gods
and their respective priests battling it out.  The title was
"Divinities and Semi-Mortals".  The other was "Principles of Item
Enchantment"; it seemed to be an introductory text on how to create
magic items. Physically, it was less of a book and more of a
three-ring binder the size of a coffee table book.  It had apparently,
as the military would so quaintly put it, 'been ruggedized,' meaning
it was designed to resist encounters with mud, sand, rapidly moving
pieces of lead, the blast fronts of high explosives, and, in this
case, apparently nuclear weapons.  The covers were plates of steel and
the pages were thin sheets of some silvery metal with words, diagrams,
and runes carefully carved into them.  The thing was heavy as hell.

</p>

<p>
Both books had a copious number of bookmarks sticking out of them,
each with a notation of what it covered carefully written in a neat,
feminine hand.  I set "Divinities and Semi-Mortals" aside for now and
opened the "Principles", flipping straight to the meticulously
thorough index.  I ran one finger down it until I saw what I was
hoping for.
</p>

<p>
"Yes!" I shouted, fistpumping.  Slamming the book shut I hefted it
(with some effort) aside and stood up.
</p>

<p>
"Come on, guys and gals," I caroled, grinning ear to ear.  "We'll
worry about the various falling anvils later.  Right now, I need to
see a man about a candle."  I was cackling maniacally as I headed for
the door.
</p>

<p>
The others looked at each other for a moment, clearly debating my
sanity, and then scrambled to follow.  I just wish I knew if they were
motivated more by duty and friendship, or by the innate human desire
to watch train wrecks in progress.
