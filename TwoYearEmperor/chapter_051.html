<p>
Thomas's eyebrows shot up and his face split in a wide, friendly
smile.  "Oh!  <em>You're</em> Afi!  A real pleasure.  I've been hoping
to meet you for a long time; there's something I wanted to ask you."
</p>

<p>
Afi cocked his head in friendly curiosity.  "What's that?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I only know a little bit about liches," Thomas began.  "Can I
say lich, by the way?  Is there a better term?"  He sounded concerned,
clearly not wanting to be offensive.
</p>

<p>
Afi waved in relaxed dismissal.  "No, lich is fine.  No worries."
</p>

<p>
Thomas looked relieved.  "Oh, good.  Anyway, I meant to ask&mdash;as a
lich, you're a massively powerful wizard...er, sorceror?"
</p>

<p>
Afi nodded. "Wizard, yes.  Well, and sorceror.  And cleric.  And a few
other things.  I try to pick up a new class every thousand years or
so, just to keep things fresh.  Finding the synergies between classes
is fascinating."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I can imagine," Thomas said, nodding in comprehension.
</p>

<p>
"Thomas, don't listen&mdash;" I began, terrified.
</p>

<p>
He spared me a brief glance and waved me quiet.  "Don't worry, Jake.
Clearly we've been misunderstanding Afi all this time.  He seems like
a great guy, and he said he just wants to have peace and work with
us."
</p>

<p>
I shut up.  This was pretty much my worst nightmare come to life;
Thomas and the others had all been replaced by pod people, and any
minute now Afi was going to decide that he didn't need me around and
would make my head explode, or an alien burst out of my chest, or
something equally fatal and disgusting.  He was between me and the
door, too...maybe I could grab a couple of the Landguard swords and
shut off magic so as to isolate myself into a single Portable Hole?
No, that wouldn't work; I'd just have to choose between suffocating or
having to shut off the antimagic and being right back where I'd
started.  And that was assuming that they would even work for me; they
might be locked to their bearers.
</p>

<p>
My mind was racing, plans flitting past, being reviewed and rejected
at lightning speed.  There had to be some way to survive this.
</p>

<p>
While I was frantically searching for options, Thomas was speaking
again. "Anyway, I meant to ask: when you're in an antimagic field like
the one Duncan just put up&mdash;sorry about that, by the
way&mdash;isn't it true that you're just a squishy half-monkey?  And
I&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
His blades came into his hands so fast that they seemed to teleport.
He kicked the table, sending it flying out of the way and knocking
people over like tenpins; the instant it was out of his way, he
blazed forward at inhuman speed, tapping his swords together as he
went.  He and Afi vanished from sight, taking the doorway with them.
</p>

<p>
Less than a minute later, he reappeared.  He was soaked in blood, as
were the walls, floor, and ceiling.  Afi's dead body&mdash;now
reverted to a skeleton&mdash;was lying at his feet in multiple pieces.
The skull was impaled on Thomas's right-hand sword.
</p>

<p>
"...I am still a twentieth level paladin of the Land," Thomas
concluded grimly.
</p>

<p>
We all just stared in shock.
</p>

<em><strong>Author's Note, supplemental:</strong> I'm selling spinoff
stories over
on <a href="http://greendogpress.blogspot.com">GreenDogPress</a>. The
first item is a novelette entitled "One Hot Night"; it's on sale for
$1. (It does NOT use any copyrighted material, meaning that it's legal
for me to sell.)</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>I intend to keep 2YE itself free, and I have no intention of
stopping until the story is done, regardless of how many sales of
spinoff work I do or don't get.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>The blurb for "One Hot Night" is:</em>
</p>
<p>
"In a society without death, Ingfred is 20 years old and has no
prospects. All the good jobs are filled by undying masters of their
craft, and it's hard to be taken seriously when you are, compared to
everyone around you, an infant.  Fortunately, he has a solution:
undergo an illegal transformation and sell the memory to The
Experiental Herald for a ridiculous sum.
</p>

<p>
There's two problems: how can Ingfred convince a powerful wizard to
risk his mage license and his freedom to help with such a crazy plan?
And, once that's done...how will Ingfred deal with the law?"
</p>

<p>
