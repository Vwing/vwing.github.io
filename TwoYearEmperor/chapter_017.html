<em><strong>Author's Note</strong>:  Still don't own D&D.</em>
</p>

<p>
The world lurched around me.  After a moment, I managed to close my
mouth and stammer out "They're&mdash;all alive?  You killed them, and
then you brought them back?  Why in the <em>world</em> would you do
that?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht stared at me in honest confusion.  "We resurrected and
rejuvenated them, of course. Why wouldn't we?  It would be monstrous
to allow them to remain dead when it's so easy to return them to their
friends and families."
</p>

<p>
The Archpriest stepped forward; the air around him was literally
shimmering with his rage.  "How <em>dare</em> you?!  You ripped those
people back from the peace of the True God's arms to this world of
pain and misery?  <em>How dare you</em>?!"
</p>

<p>
The general opposite me rose slowly to his feet, hands on the table
and leaning forward.  Suddenly, there was no trace of Albrecht
L&ouml;fgren, the charming and effusive uncle-figure.  This was the
High Marshal of Anundj&aring;, a general hundreds of years old who
conquered vast territory with terrifying ease.  His voice was soft but
it shook with rage.  "How dare I?  How dare I bring them back to be
with their loved ones, to help build a society of grace and knowledge
that climbs ever upwards despite the undead horrors it faces? A
society that has conquered death, and disease, and hurts of all form?
That fights every single day to prevent the total destruction of life
on this planet? How dare I bring them back to live, to love, to better
the world with their existence? Do you realize that all those souls
that pass on to the Outer Planes eventually disperse and cease to
exist as conscious entities?  <em>How dare you allow them to die, you
heartless simpleton!</em>"
</p>

<p>
The Archpriest raised his hand, speaking words of power that would
blot Albrecht from the face of the earth; the High Marshal's bodyguard
raised their wands and their weapons and were a tenth of a second from
firing, and oh my god we were all going to die and after us the Deorsi
would pour through their portal and burn this city to the ground
and&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Thomas punched the Archpriest in the back of the head, hard.
</p>

<p>
Michael, son of John, this world's equivalent of the Pope, the next
best thing to an avatar of a major god, sprawled to the ground and
skidded several yards across the paving stones.  His spell fizzled
away in a shower of golden sparks as his words were interrupted.  The
Hierophants and High Priests started casting against Thomas, but the
Landguard were suddenly right up in their faces, the tips of their
blades literally in the casters' mouths, disrupting their spells
mid-syllable.
</p>

<p>
The tension eased very slowly.  We all recognized that we were
balanced on the edge of the abyss and no one wanted to be the one that
took the wrong step that would push us over.
</p>

<p>
After a moment, Albrecht seated himself again and busied his hands
with the teapot.  He kept his head down, eyes locked on the table as
he struggled to master himself.  Once the tart ruby tea was poured and
stirred to his satisfaction he took a long sip, eyes closed, breathing
deeply and slowly.  Nearly a minute later, he opened his eyes again
and locked them on me like twin gun barrels.  There was no trace of
the happy, bubbly man with whom I had shared a delicious meal.  (On
the other hand, he was no longer in the grip of that killing rage so,
win.)
</p>

<p>
"We seem to have hit something of a difficulty in our conversation,"
Albrecht informed us in a dead flat tone.  "I had intended to do this
in a gentle fashion, to bring you into the Union as friends and
allies.  I had thought that your willingness to accept the deaths of
millions was simply because you lacked the means to solve the problem,
but now that I have seen the attitude of your primary church, I
realize that this monstrosity is through deliberate choice.
Therefore, we shall speak more plainly.
</p>

<p>
"One way or another, Flobovia will become part of the Union of
Anundj&aring;.  You will lend your strength to protecting all life
from the drauga.  I would prefer if you joined willingly, but it is
within my power to conquer this nation by fire and sword.  You know
it, I know it.  Even if you were, by some miracle, able to wipe out my
Expeditionary Force, I could have a full Legion&mdash;or ten Legions,
if need be&mdash;here within a day.  According to our last census, the
Union has nearly a <em>billion</em> citizens, and fully thirty percent
are under arms.  Do you understand what that means?  We have ten times
as many soldiers as you have citizens.  If you force me to, I can
quite literally flood your country with troops."
</p>

<p>He paused and swept his eyes over us all, most especially the
Archpriest, who was being assisted to his feet by one of his
Hierophants.  "Make no mistake; if the drauga are not already here in
numbers, they will come.  Without support from Anundj&aring; you will
all die, to the last babe in arms."
</p>

<p>
Again that measured pause.  "Should you force us to expend the effort
to conquer you, you will become a vassal state.  Vassal states live
under martial law; self governance is denied, and every single
citizen, including infants, is placed under Mark of Justice and Geas
spells that enforce their loyalty.  No native-born spellcasters are
allowed to live in a vassal state; they are all drafted to the army
and forward deployed.  Trustworthy Anundj&aring;n casters will be
assigned to maintain health and prosperity so long as,
and <em>only</em> so long as, the vassal nation is compliant.  This is
not a fate you should desire.
</p>

<p>
"On the other hand, should you agree to join the Union willingly,
Flobovia will be accepted as a provisional member.  Your military will
be transferred to Anundj&aring;.  They will be dispersed and
integrated into the Legions, where they will guard against the
drauga. Union soldiers will be assigned to guard your borders and
population centers. Union officials will assume final power over your
government at every level, although you will be allowed reasonable
control and your local customs will be disturbed as little as
possible.  Union schools and guilds will be set up to lift your
population to a decent standard of living.  The High Church will send
missionaries and found temples, which will also serve as medical
stations, education centers, and bunkers where the population may be
protected in the event of attack.  Your existing religions will be
permitted to exist so long as they do not interfere with the High
Church.  Every citizen will be required to produce at least one child
every decade as part of their duty to the Union.  These children will
be educated in Union schools.
</p>

<p>
"There are carrots to go with this stick.  You will receive full
access to Anundj&aring;n medical treatment, including&mdash;" his eyes
flashed daggers at the Archpriest, "&mdash;rejuvenation and
resurrection for all citizens.  Until you become full members of the
Union, no citizen will be allowed to choose permanent death.  You will
also receive access to Anundj&aring;n transportation gates, allowing
for much faster trade and greater economic growth.  In a century, if
you manage to establish yourselves as loyal members of the Union, you
will be elevated to full membership.  Your soldiers will begin to be
permitted to return home, and most of your governance will be returned
to local hands."
</p>

<p>
He studied us for a long minute, much as a scientist might consider a
new species of beetle.  "This is not a small decision; I understand
that you will need time to gather your officials and discuss it.  For
myself, I need to finish raising my men and arrange for enough
reinforcements that I can enforce martial law if you choose unwisely.
</p>

<p>
"I grant you one week to discuss it.  I will hold my army where it
currently stands and venture no further into your country.  You have
until sunrise on the eighth day from now to communicate your answer
via Sending.  If your answer is yes, we welcome you.  If your answer
is no, we will take your nation by force and your populace will become
citizens of the Union whether they will it or not."
</p>

<p>
Again he paused, and when he spoke, his voice was once again hard.
"Make no mistake; I grant one week's truce, and I expect to receive
the same. If we are attacked, scouted, scried upon, or in any way
molested before the week has expired I will burn your pissant country
to the ground and pull this entire dungheap of a city apart stone by
stone. No resurrections will be provided for anyone living within
these walls. To speak plainly, I will condemn your souls and the souls
of a million of your people to non-existence should you break faith
with me; if you have any concern for those citizens you purport to
shepherd, don't test me."
</p>

<p>
There was a long pause as he stared us down, anger seething in his
eyes.  Finally he stepped back into the circle of his attendants.
"For now, I bid you good day."  With that, he and all of his
companions joined hands and looked to the sky.  Albrecht spoke in a
voice that rang across the square.  "I Wish for myself and all my
companions to be transported back to my command tent."  They all took
a single step together and disappeared like a popped soap bubble.
</p>

<em><strong>Author's Note, part the second:</strong> This chapter was
interesting to write; I didn't recognize the implications of the Union
of Anundj&aring;'s magical "technology" until I was more than halfway
through.  Based on what Albrecht said, the Union has passed through
the Singularity and become a post-scarcity society.</em>
