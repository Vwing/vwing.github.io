<em><strong>Author's Note</strong>:  Still don't own D&D.</em>
</p>

<hr />

<p>
There are two observations I would like to make about sleep: (a) it is
necessary for sanity and good health, (b) that necessity is more
irritating than fire ants in your skivvies.
</p>

<p>
I mean, seriously?  I'll be lucky to live 90 years, and you want me to
spend <em>30</em> of them unconscious and immobile?!  Really???  This
right here is why I don't believe in intelligent design.
</p>

<p>
Back in the real world, I had tried all sorts of things to deal with
the annoying need for sleep.  I'd taken modafinil (didn't affect me
much), drunk tea by the gallon (yellowed my teeth a bit; thank god for
Crest Whitening), tried polyphasic sleep (very limited success), and
just shorted myself consistently.  There would be time to sleep when I
was dead, and sleeping seven hours a night instead of eight
effectively meant living almost an extra four years.  (If by 'living'
you meant 'existing as a conscious and self-directed entity,' which is
exactly what I did mean.)
</p>

<p>
With all this in mind, it is my sincere pleasure to introduce: the
Fortifying Bedroll.
</p>

<p>
[Cute little cherubs erupt in a rousing chorus of 'Hallelujah!
Hallelujah! Halleluuuuuuujaaah!' Women weep unabashed tears of joy.
Men from cultures with a tradition of machismo desperately wish that
they came from some other culture because they're struggling not to
bawl like little children, damnit.]
</p>

<p>
Here's the thing: if you're sleeping on a Fortifying Bedroll, you only
need an hour of sleep.  You wake up fully refreshed, bright-eyed,
bushy-tailed, and all sorts of other adjectives that refer to a happy
and energetic state.  Swear to god, if I could get this thing back to
my world I would bloody marry it.  Its only downside is that you
can only use it every other day.  To partially make up the gap we
had passed out Rings of Sustenance that would cover the even-numbered
days.  Problem with the Rings was that you had to wear them for a week
before they kicked in, but after that you didn't need to eat and you
only needed two hours of sleep a night.  Unfortunately, if you took
the thing off, even just to wash your hands, you had to wear it for
another week before it did you any good again.
</p>

<p>
I had asked Fragment if we could make a custom version of the Ring
that didn't have the one-week downside.  He (it?) had just stared at
me, sniffed, and said <strong>"No."</strong>  I wasn't certain, but I
thought it might just have been petty revenge for asking if I could
cut a few of his bits off in order to make Ice Assassins of him.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, it was ten thirty at night when we went to sleep.  It took me
a little while to fall asleep&mdash;too many exciting things going on,
my brain wouldn't shut up&mdash;but I finally dropped off.  At
midnight I was up and about again, feeling as perky and bright as a
high school cheerleader.  (Hm.  That analogy may not have been
entirely appropriate for a 40-year old man.  Ah well, never mind.)
</p>

<p>
After I got done kissing the fabric of my Bedroll, stroking it
lovingly, and muttering about "My preciousssss," we got back to work.
(What?  Leave me alone, this whole sleep thing <em>really</em> bothers
me, ok?)
</p>

<p>
Well, actually, we didn't get back to work immediately.  First I went
and took a loooong hot shower.  Let me tell you, the fact that there
were now enough magi to cast Magnificent Mansions for everyone...that
was just bloody awesome.  There was so much room now that people
actually felt free to put <em>bathrooms</em> in...<em>real</em>
bathrooms!  Not just a pot filled with water and a glorified
Sani-Wipe!
</p>

<p>
Hey, you try wallowing in your own body stink for a week, see how
excited you get about a hot shower.  I'm gonna guess the answer will
be 'pretty damn excited.'
</p>

<p>
After my luxuriant shower (and everyone else's, in the <em>multiple
other bathrooms</em> (yes, that was how much space we had now!)),
there was a luxuriant breakfast.  Here's how Magnificent the
Magnificent Mansion is: whatever food you ask the magical servants
for, they can produce it.  I had a perfect Belgian waffle covered in
enough fruit to choke a horse, a beautiful crepe filled with bananas
and nutella, rich sourdough toast spread with exactly the right amount
of butter, a hot almond croissant, and fresh squeezed orange juice to
wash it all down.  The portions of each thing were tiny enough that I
could eat it all without feeling gross. (Who knew that you could make
a Belgian waffle the size of an english muffin?)
</p>

<p>
"Ok, all disasters mostly averted or dealt with, no immediate issues
to deal with; it's finally time!" I caroled.  "I'm going through the
FLEA!  I can't <em>wait</em> to be an Archmage so that I can make
reality my chewtoy."
</p>

<p>
Thomas shot Reynard and Isaac an alarmed look.  "Is that really a good
idea, Jake?" he said carefully.  "So far, your interactions with our
world's laws have been very hit or miss.  The mind magic made you
psychotic, we found that you can't be resurrected, and the color of
your sacrifice wasn't anything we could recognize, suggesting that you
don't have an alignment as we understand it."
</p>

<p>
"Don't care," I told him happily.  "I've been wanting to be a wizard
since I was two years old.  This is my chance, I'm not missing it.
Come on!"  I popped up, swiped a few final crumbs off my mouth before
tossing the napkin down and striding from the room.
</p>

<p>
The others jumped to their feet, hurrying to catch up.  Thomas
convinced me to hold up for a few minutes while he dispatched some
Landguard to clear the way and set up the usual circles of protective
Landguard around me; I waited with ill grace, arms crossed and foot
jiggling at hyperspeed like a sugared-up toddler waiting for the
bathroom.
</p>

<p>
Eventually he couldn't delay it any longer, at which point I set off
for the closest FLEA at a fast powerwalk.  It wasn't a long trip; out
the door, through a Teleportation Circle that dumped us at one of the
now-multiple FLEAs, and up the ladder to the platform.  The night was
dark&mdash;unsurprising since it was oh-dark-hundred in the morning
(that's military speak for 'two am')&mdash;but there were plenty of
Continual Flame items scattered around so we could all see what we
were doing.
</p>

<p>
I found myself eagerly leaning forward like a runner about to bust
through the finish tape.  I thought about making the conscious effort
to not look quite so dorky but that just wasn't an option at the
moment.
</p>

<p>
"C'mon, c'mon, c'mon," I muttered, making little 'hurry up' gestures
at the mage who was coordinating all this.
</p>

<p>
"Execute!" she cried in her irritatingly mellifluous elven voice.
</p>

<p>
"Polymorph Any Object: Pebble to Gray Linnorm!" cried half a dozen
magi, pointing at the miniature rock garden scattered across the
monster platform.
</p>

<p>
"GRAAWWWWRRRR!" cried the giant scaly monsters.
</p>

<p>
"Shrinken!" I cried in gleeful anticipation of the rush of great
cosmic power that was about to flood through me.
</p>

<p>
"Graawr? Urk!" cried the giant scaly monsters as they fell to their
deaths like mooks in a platformer video game.
</p>

<p>
"Yes!  I have the pow...er?" I said, my triumphant cry rather falling
apart there at the end as great cosmic power notably <em>failed</em>
to flood through me.
</p>

<p>
"Everything all right, Your Majesty?" Thomas asked solicitously.
</p>

<p>
I felt water gathering at the corners of my eyes.  "Where's the great
cosmic power?" I whined.  "There was supposed to be great cosmic
power."
</p>

<p>
Reynard eyed me sympathetically.  "Sorry," he said, patting me on the
shoulder.  "I suspected when you didn't gain anything from the
artillery attack on Afi's legion.  Seems you can't get experience
points, so you can't level up."
</p>

<p>
"But...but...that is so unfair!" I whimpered.  "Maybe if I tried
again?" I asked hopefully.  "Maybe there just weren't enough Linnorms.
Maybe I'm already high level in something, so it wasn't enough to make
me go up.  Maybe if there were more...let's try a couple hundred!  We
can do that, right?  We've got enough casters?"
</p>

<p>
Hand still on my shoulder, Reynard gently led me towards the ladder.
"I doubt it would work, I'm afraid.  You didn't gain anything from the
cannon strike even though Thomas, Duncan, and Robert all went up
multiple levels.  If you were able to get experience points, you would
have gotten them then.  And two hundred Linnorms is enough to level up
two dozen other people...would you really want to deny them their
chance for the sake of an experiment that probably wouldn't work?"
</p>

<p>
I had to think carefully about that one for a few seconds, but
eventually I climbed down the ladder.  Didn't stop me from grumbling
the whole way down.
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
The remainder of the daylight hours were spent in making and preparing
strategic plans, making and implementing contingency plans for our
visit with Afi, and wallowing in self pity.  It wasn't fair!  All I
wanted was to be a nigh-omnipotent spellcaster, able to reshape
reality at my slightest whim.  Was that <em>really</em> so much to ask?
</p>

<p>
Eventually, however, night fell, and it was time for the next stage of
our grand adventure: the resurrection of Herr&uacute;n, the ancient
Goddess of Secrets and Knowledge!  
</p>

<p>
When we walked outside, I was expecting to see a field of stars,
hopefully the colored stars heavily outnumbering the black ones.  This
was not what we saw.  There were not soft points of light casting a
haze of color between and betwixt them.  No, there was a bloody great
silver luminescent <em>roof</em> over the canyon, rippling in curves
and flowing waves, shining as bright as a streetlamp.  It stretched
from wall to wall, as far up and down the canyon as the altars
stretched&mdash;nearly a hundred yards by now.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's...different," I said, deadpan.
</p>

<p>
Beside me, Thomas nodded without speaking or looking away from the
silver ocean that coated the air thirty feet above us.
</p>

<p>
After a minute, we walked up the canyon far enough that we were out
from under it.  Looking back, I could see that the stuff was a good
ten or twelve feet thick, which was even more appalling given that I
knew perfectly well this all came from the sacrifice of the books we
were still busily railgunning into the fires.  Whatever was in those
books, there was a <em>lot</em> of it.  I looked carefully, but
couldn't see a single speck of any color other than silver.  I didn't
know if the other stars had been destroyed, converted, or were simply
buried under the silver light, but there wasn't a glint or a gleam of
them.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose we should finish this," Drifa said, a bit uncertainly.
From some tiny corner of my mind that wasn't completely overwhelmed, I
noticed that she wasn't able to tear herself away from the silver sky
any more than we could.
</p>

<p>
I nodded, also not looking away from the enormous mass of light.
</p>

<p>
Drifa stared along with the rest of of us for another moment, then
shook herself.  "Right," she said firmly, and marched down to the
central altar to meet up with some of her subordinate Archpriests.
After a moment I followed her, taking up a position against the wall
thirty or forty feet away, the Landguard forming two rows on either
side of me.
</p>

<p>
Drifa spoke to the other Archpriests; they nodded and moved down the
line of altars, talking briefly to people at each one.  In their wake,
the sacrifices stopped and people moved back into the various
Gr&#491;fhamr nodes.  Everything got very quiet once all the
Gr&#491;fhamrites stopped racing through the canyon and mumbling their
prayers of sacrifice; the only sound was the faint <em>crunch</em> of
sand and gravel under the feet of the priests as they moved back to
where Drifa waited at the center altar.  There wasn't even a breath of
wind; the entire world seemed to be holding its breath in preparation
for what was about to happen.
</p>

<p>
Drifa waited until all the other priests had taken their places around
the altar, checking carefully to make sure that everyone was in proper
position and ready.  She raised her arms like a conductor preparing an
orchestra to perform.
</p>

<p>
"Lords of Light and Dark, we call thee," she declaimed in a high,
clear voice.  "Overgods of All That Is, we invoke thee.  Creation and
Destruction, Temporal and Eternal, Weal and Woe, we command thee," she
declaimed.
</p>

<p>
"We command thee," echoed the other Archpriests.
</p>

<p>
"We speak now of Herr&uacute;n, Lady of Secrets and Knowledge, taken
from us these millenia agone.  We shape her name on our tongues."
</p>

<p>
"We shape her name," came back the reply in a tone of unshakable
conviction.  Power radiated from Drifa and the Archpriests alike,
ringing forth in a bell-like tone that sustained without hint of
an ending.
</p>

<p>
"We see her visage in our minds," Drifa continued.
</p>

<p>
"We see her visage."
</p>

<p>
"We hear her words in our ears."
</p>

<p>
"We hear her words."
</p>

<p>
"We cast forth our power for her being.  We build her form from our
faith and hopes and dreams."
</p>

<p>
"We build her form."
</p>

<p>
There was no pause, no hesitation, but Drifa seemed to gather herself
before continuing.  "We do not beseech," she declared, her voice soft
and hard, the tone of someone calling out an opponent.
</p>

<p>
"We do not beseech," her chorus echoed.  The bell-tone was beginning
to shake.  An oppressive force loomed over the canyon, pressing down
on all of us. I had to plant my feet and force myself upright or it
would have knocked me down.
</p>

<p>
"We build her form against all challenge, against all opposition,"
Drifa said firmly, her voice roughened with the sound of someone
trying to speak while lifting a load that was right at the limit of
their strength.
</p>

<p>
"We build her form against all challenge, against all opposition,"
came the response.  The Archpriests were clearly straining; one of
them swayed and almost stumbled before catching himself.
</p>

<p>
"We give our faith and hope and dreams to thee, O Lady of Mystery,"
Drifa continued in a voice that was almost a grunt.  She was shaking,
sweat pouring off her face.  The air around her was beginning to
shimmer; a wind was pouring out of nowhere, pressing in on her from
all sides.  The sand at her feet was being whipped up, scraping across
her hands and face where they weren't covered by her robes; she winced
as blood oozed from an abrasion on her cheek, and she blinked hard,
trying to get rid of the faceful of grit that had just blasted into
her eyes.  An aura of golden light flared around her, washing away the
damage almost-but-not-quite as fast as it could be inflicted.
</p>

<p>
"We have gathered Your power," Drifa gasped, the shaking getting worse
by the moment.
</p>

<p>
"We have gathered Your power," came the grunted reply.   
</p>

<p>
"We give You form and call&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<strong>Stop, my child.</strong>"
</p>

<p>
The woman towered above us all, the top of her head only inches below
the sea of silvery light.  She was plump and round-faced, dressed in
comfortable robes, and embodied the very archetype of an angry mother
chastising an errant daughter.
</p>

<p>
The wind around Drifa had ceased the moment the goddess appeared, but
the strain was still there.  Despite the force that weighed against
her, Drifa pulled herself upright and turned to face what was clearly
her patron goddess.
</p>

<p>
"Mother, I will not," she said firmly.  She tried to cover it, but I
could hear the tremble in her voice as she defied her own deity.
</p>

<p>
The goddess frowned.  "<strong>My child, you <em>will</em> obey me in
this,</strong>" she said, threat pouring off the words like heat from
a fire.
</p>

<p>
Drifa staggered under the weight of her goddess's disapproval, but
forced herself erect and glared back defiantly.  "Mother, I <em>will
not stop</em>.  You are Goddess of Home and Hearth; family is your
domain, and this is what I must do to protect <em>my</em>
family&mdash;my chosen family.  As much as I love You, You do not have
the power to stand up to the God of Death, and we need one who can."
</p>

<p>
A divine eyebrow arched and Her mouth drew tighter in anger.  She
folded her arms across her chest; power positively <em>crackled</em>
off of Her, the air actually shattering where it touched Her.
</p>

<p>
"<strong>And you believe that this upstart will have the
power?</strong>" She demanded.  "<strong>A goddess with a handful of
worshippers, and you think that <em>She</em> can protect you from
Neklos where <em>I</em> cannot?  You presume greatly, child.</strong>"
</p>

<p>
Drifa was trembling, her eyes captured by those of her goddess.  I
well remembered the power of a displeased god's gaze; the fact that
Drifa could stay on her feet under it was a testament to her
incredible will.
</p>

<p>
"No, not the power to stand up to Him directly, Mother. But She can
give us the knowledge we need&mdash;the locations of our enemies'
strongholds, the plans they make, the numbers and kind of their
armies.  We are doomed without that knowledge, Mother."
</p>

<p>
"In fairness, Milly, there is that whole 'free will' thing.  You
should really let her make her choice before you act," Loki added,
casually stepping out of Drifa's shadow and taking up a place beside
her.  He rested a hand gently on her shoulder and some of the pressure
on her seemed to fall away; her trembling eased, and she took the
first full breath I'd seen her take for over a minute.  His touch must
have also freed her from her goddess's gaze, because she flicked her
eyes sideways to him with a grateful nod.
</p>

<p>
The Mother goddess snarled in fury, the air around her screaming as
her rage lashed the ground around her.
</p>

<p>
"<strong>You have no right here, Wilgam.  You will depart or I will
crush you here and now in full sight of all these mortals,</strong>"
she threatened.
</p>

<p>
He tipped his head back and forth in exaggerated thought for a moment.
"Hmmmmmm, let me think about that...yeah, no.  Really not
happening. Sorry Milly.  Oh, also, I'm going by Loki now.  More
familiar to these guys, so it'd be polite for you to get it right.
Anyway, why don't you and I step out for just a moment and discuss
this?  I really think that the situation isn't as bad as&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She slapped him.
</p>

<p>
Amilsandre, Lady of Home and Hearth&mdash;once I heard Loki's nickname
for her I had recognized her from the <em>Divinities and
Semi-Mortals</em> book that Suze had given me way back when.  She was
one of the greatest of the greater goddesses, worshipped far and wide
across Arannias by women and men alike.  She was surprisingly nuanced:
she embodied familial bonds, the safety and comfort of a home, the
love of the land held in trust by a family...and also the power of
blood vengeance, the hatred that came from generations-long feuds, the
fierceness of battle to protect loved ones.  She <em>had</em> an
aspect as a gentle stay-at home mother, but this wasn't it.  This was
the face of Mother Vengeance, a warrior goddess focused on
up-close-and-very-very-personal fighting.
</p>

<p>
As Loki finished his insouciant taunt, she stepped forward, shrinking
to slightly-more-than-human size so as not to have to stoop, and
lashed out with an open-hand strike.  Her hand moved so fast it left
an afterimage on my retinas and a sonic boom in its wake; Loki went
flying, smashing into the canyon wall with a sickening <em>thud!</em>
and the sound of bones snapping like twigs.
</p>

<p>
Amilsandre stalked towards her fellow god, murder in her eyes.  A
wickedly long carving knife and a pot lid shimmered into existence in
her hands.  Kitchen implements or not, I had no doubt they would serve
perfectly well as short sword and buckler.
</p>

<p>
Everyone's eyes were dragged with her, terrified at the idea of being
so near a battle between gods. Despite that fear, it took only a
moment for Drifa to pull herself away from the sight and straighten up
again, raising her arms to continue the ritual.  The pressure had
decreased; I could feel its weight still on me, but it was no more
than I would feel from a heavy pack.  Drifa bore up under it without
apparent effort.
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;&mdash;," she said.  I could see her mouth moving, but I
couldn't hear the words; she and her Archpriest backup band were
utterly silent as they continued the chant.  They seemed to be moving
faster, as though they were rushing through the words and gestures.
The sea of light above us was roiling like water at a high boil, darts
of lightning snapping through it as the ritual clearly approached its
conclusion.
</p>

<p>
"Oof," Loki said, forcing himself upright from where he sprawled
against the wall.  His neck was at an impossible angle and his limbs
were clearly broken in multiple places.  "Good...ow...hit, Milly," he
grunted, using both hands to straighten his head.  From fifty feet
away, I could hear the snaps and clicks as bones shifted back into
place and mended.  "Not quite good enough, though.  Do we really need
to dance this dance?  Are you sure you wouldn't like to talk it
ou&mdash;" He jumped aside just in time to avoid a wicked slash of the
carving knife, but wasn't fast enough to avoid taking the followup
shield-bash to the face.  It knocked him back, flipping him end over
end to land facedown in the dirt.
</p>

<p>
"Man, she's really workin' that rage thing, isn't she?  I'm glad that
was just a duplicate," murmured the little beetle on the canyon wall
next to my ear.  I startled, glancing at it and then quickly looking
away so as not to attract attention.
</p>

<p>
A small patch of air in front of me silvered over, forming a perfect
mirror that showed the beetle beside me.  "Much better.  Always nicer
to talk when you can see people's eyes, don't you think?" it said in a
quieter version of Loki's warm tenor that I really shouldn't have been
able to hear or understand because well, <em>beetle</em>.  I flicked
my eyes at the beetle in the mirror, then then gave a significant
glance at Amilsandre.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no worries," the beetle said, giving a relaxed wave of one
foreleg.  "She can't hear us.  Just don't move your lips too much when
you talk, and don't look directly at me."
</p>

<p>
I'm glad he said that last part, because there was no way that I could
have torn my eyes away from what was happening in the middle of the
canyon.
</p>

<p>
I have a collection of life rules that I try to follow, little bits of
wisdom accumulated over the years.  Among them: 'Do not pee on
electric fences,' and 'If you ever find yourself saying "Hey, y'all,
watch this!"...reconsider whatever it is you're doing.' I had never
before felt the need to add 'Do not be near a fight between gods' to
the list.  I very carefully added it now, right at the top.  In big
block letters.  With multiple underlines.
</p>

<p>
Giant knives flew in all directions; Loki turned into an ant to duck
beneath them.  Enormous cooking pots appeared in the air, pouring
superheated water everywhere and turning the canyon floor into
steaming hot mud.  Loki hunkered down under a brightly colored beach
umbrella, then froze the mud and speed-skated across the ice in a
futile effort at escape.
</p>

<p>
Amilsandre reached out an arm and yanked at thin air; in response, the
edge of the canyon wall was torn from its moorings, thousands of tons
of stone converting into dressed building stones and plummeting to
crush Loki.  Before it could land, he shrank to the form of a gecko
and skittered across the canyon's suddenly-sandy-again floor at
lightning speed, just getting clear of the avalanche.  As soon as he
was clear he transformed back into his human shape, scrambling to his
feet and racing off down the canyon.
</p>

<p>
Only to slam face first into a brick wall that thrust itself up from
the ground.  He staggered back and plummeted down a well that opened
below his feet.  The well immediately collapsed on itself in a shower
of dust...but not quite fast enough to catch the hummingbird that came
streaking out of the cave-in, only to shift back to Loki.  A fireplace
big enough to roast an ox appeared a few feet away from him, the
flames flaring up and reaching for him with hungry fingers.
</p>

<p>
Instantly, Loki's clothes vanished, replaced by a firefighter's bunker
gear, mask, and tank.  He tumbled through the fire and across the
canyon floor, ending up back on his feet and wearing his Harlequin
motley agagin.  Dusting himself off, he turned to Amilsandre again
with a disappointed face.  "Now Milly, that wasn't very polite," he
scolded.  "Aren't you supposed to do that whole 'courtesy and respect'
thing at home and hearth?  Shouldn't that be your&mdash;urk!"
</p>

<p>
His words were cut off when a wooden gate slammed open behind him,
hurling him forward like he'd been hit by a battering ram.  The impact
landed him on the ground just in front of Amilsandre.  She blurred
forward, knife shifting to an overhand grip as she struck down at
Loki's neck in a blow that would have completely decapitated him had
it landed.
</p>

<p>
Barely in time, Loki rolled aside, trailing two dozen copies of
himself as he went.  They snapped to their feet and raced away; most
went up the canyon away from Drifa and the rest of us, one splashed
down into a sea of insects that raced in all directions, several
shifted into falcons and exploded into the air at top speed, and six
of them dove at Amilsandre, trying to tackle her to the ground and pin
her to give the others time to escape.  Her knife flicked out in
short, precise cuts like a farm wife dismembering a chicken, and all
the attacking Lokis were dead before they could so much as lay a
finger on her.  They fell bonelessly to the ground, golden blood
pumping everywhere, and vanished with a series of tiny <em>pop</em>s.
</p>

<p>
"Ooh, ouch," the beetle murmured, munching its popcorn calmly.
</p>

<p>
Amilsandre curled her fingers in the air and <em>pulled;</em>
lightning blasted from a clear sky, burning the falcons out of the
air and crisping the insects in their tracks.  A curtain of standing
lightning bolts filled the space up-canyon from us, blocking the
remaining Lokis from getting away.
</p>

<p>
A spray of sand hit Amilsandre in the side of her face; she turned to
find one of the Lokis pelting her with rocks, sand, small shrubs and
anything else he could grab.  With a contemptuous snort she hurled the
knife like a giant dagger, pinning Loki to the wall with an impact so
powerful that the rock shattered for a dozen feet in every direction.
An instant after the blade struck, the Trickster's impaled decoy
shimmered and vanished.  Amilsandre's knife leaped back to her hand
and she blurred off after the fleeing Loki clones, cutting them down
one by one as she hunted for the original.
</p>

<p>
"I never get tired of that," the beetle said in amusement.  "It's just
so <em>easy</em> to get her goat, and then she never&mdash;crap!"  He
vanished instantly as the giant carving knife slammed into the wall
where he'd been lounging.  It thrummed in the stone for a moment, half
an inch from my ear, then pulled itself out and leaped back to its
owner's hand as she came back down the canyon to us like an avenging
angel.
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;before us now!" Drifa shouted triumphantly, thrusting her arms
at the sky.
</p>

<p>
The entirety of the silver stormcloud blasted down in a giant tornado
of lightning and thunder, pouring over Drifa's body like a second
skin.  She convulsed, head back and screaming, hands curled into claws
from the pain and wonder of birthing a goddess.
</p>

<p>
"<strong>STOP!</strong>" Amilsandre bellowed, reaching for
Drifa&mdash;whether to kill her or merely interrupt her I wasn't sure.
</p>

<p>
The silver aura around the Master High Priestess curled up in a
glowing pseudopod and slapped Amilsandre's hand away.  The pseudopod
poured to the ground, rapidly shifting to the figure of a human woman
made of silver lightning.  Amilsandre was so shocked by the blow that
she dropped her weapons and clutched her hand; from where I stood I
could tell that it was actually burned, badly, although the damage was
fading fast.
</p>

<p>
Before Amilsandre could get her wits together for another try,
Herr&uacute;n had finished manifesting.  She was as I had seen her in
my dream&mdash;tall for a human woman, horse-faced, with greying hair
and long, rangy limbs clothed in a red and black patchwork.
</p>

<p>
Amilsandre's weapons shimmered back into her hands and she lunged with
the knife, a long thrust that should have skewered the newborn
Herr&uacute;n like a bug.  Instead, the knife passed through empty air
where she'd been and buried itself in the central altar of the
now-completed ritual, splitting it down the middle.
</p>

<p>
"Calm down, sis," the newborn goddess said from off to the side.  "We
both know I can't beat you, but I can live long enough to reveal your
secrets to those who want them.  Calm down and talk to me for a
second."
</p>

<p>
Amilsandre turned to face the younger goddess.  The look She gave
Herr&uacute;n should have burned her to ash on the spot, but She
opened her hands and allowed Her weapons to shimmer into nothingness.
She took a deep breath and composed herself.
</p>

<p>
"So.  You're back," Amilsandre said, losing the boom and reverb but
keeping the clearly apparent irritation.
</p>

<p>
"Herry-bug!  You're looking great!" Loki called, parachuting down from
the top of the canyon with a happy wave.
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n glanced up with a fond smile.  "Hi, Dad," she said,
waving back.
</p>

<p>
<em>The blurb for "One Hot Night" is:</em>
</p>
<p>
"In a society without death, Ingfred is 20 years old and has no
prospects. All the good jobs are filled by undying masters of their
craft, and it's hard to be taken seriously when you are, compared to
everyone around you, an infant.  Fortunately, he has a solution:
undergo an illegal transformation and sell the memory to The
Experiental Herald for a ridiculous sum.
</p>

<p>
There's two problems: how can Ingfred convince a powerful wizard to
risk his mage license and his freedom to help with such a crazy plan?
And, once that's done...how will Ingfred deal with the law?"
</p>
