<p>
I stepped close, careful to move slowly and to approach from within
Thomas's field of vision so as not to startle him.  I pitched my voice
low and soft as though calming a frightened horse.  "Thomas," I
murmured, extending a hand in reassurance.  "Thomas, let him talk.  We
won't learn anything if he's in too much pain to be coherent."
</p>

<p>
Thomas snarled deep in his chest but eased his grip slightly and
pulled the dagger out of Albrecht's eye.  Albrecht sagged in his grip,
tears of blood rolling down his cheek.
</p>

<p>
I leaned casually against the wall of the cave, my arms folded across
my chest.  "Albie, you got some 'splaining to do," I told him in my
best Ricky Ricardo accent.
</p>

<p>
His knees went out from under him; for a moment Thomas held him in
place by his jaw but finally, with a grunt of disgust, he opened his
hand and let Albrecht collapse.  One sharp, vicious kick to the ribs
(Albrecht moaned in pain as they splintered) and Thomas spun away,
stalking off a few feet before turning back to stare at Albrecht.  I
suspected he didn't trust himself to be closer; his hands were
clenching and unclenching and the look on his face was utterly,
shatteringly blank.  I had seen him kill people while wearing more
expression than that.
</p>

<p>
"Albrecht, my dear friend, my most trusted colleague and ally, my role
model in all things role-modelly...I really strongly suggest that you
start talking before Thomas decides you'd look better with a few less
limbs."  I kept my tone light and didn't move from my casual lean on
the wall.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht's sobs were growing softer as he gathered himself.  The flow
of blood had slackened, and when he looked up I saw that his eye
was...better.  Not fixed, but better.  Tiny traces of blue and gold
energy crackled around the wound, and I could see it slowly closing,
the obscuring blood slowly purging from the eye.
</p>

<p>
"Neat trick," I commented, gesturing to his eye.  "Ring of
Regeneration?"
</p>

<p>
He gave a jerky nod.  "Given my lifestyle, it just makes sense."  His
voice reeked of pain, but he was regaining a trace of his normal
insouciance as the wound healed.
</p>

<p>
I nodded agreement.  "'Course, it also means Thomas can cut your eyes
out as much as he wants."  I let that one hang in the air a moment
before continuing.  "So...storytime, Uncle Albrecht.  And make it a
good one."
</p>

<p>
He sighed and shifted a bit, pushing his legs out in front of him and
leaning back on the wall.  For a moment he let his head sag back and
his face go slack in exhaustion.  Finally, he visibily gathered
himself, sat up, and looked at me.
</p>

<p>
"Everything I told you about Anundj&aring; was true...before.  The
last census was ten years ago; at the time, we had over a billion
people, and the average age was a hundred and ninety eight, or two
hundred and sixty four if you didn't count newborns and children under
one year.  Between medical magic and resurrection spells, no one died
unless they chose to...and almost no one chose to.  People changed
appearance and gender almost as often as they changed clothes; we had
to have Arcane Marks tattooed onto us to identify us across
bodychanges.  There were even people who would transform into animals
or stones, just to see what it was like.  Turning into a ruby or a
rosebush is safe; that transformation reverts in a few minutes or
hours.  Turning into a wolf, though...that one is permanent, and your
intelligence changes to that of a wolf, so it's important to make sure
the animal form doesn't get loose and run away before you can be
changed back.  I remember one time, my nephew&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Thomas crossed his arms; Albrecht broke off in mid-sentence.  "All of
that changed six years ago," he continued.  "We never knew what hit
us; one of the lichs must have dropped a Teleportation Circle into the
middle of Halsaland, because suddenly there were tens of thousands of
wraiths and wights and vampires everywhere, killing everyone.  Each
person the lesser drauga killed rose immediately as another drauga,
which let them expand like wildfire.  The common folk were converted
like that, mostly to wraiths.  The more powerful citizens&mdash;anyone
with class levels, basically&mdash;were taken prisoner and brought to
the vampires so that their skills and powers could be used by the
enemy.  It takes a few days for someone to become a vampire, of
course, but it's much worse than having them become a lesser beast.  A
wraith <em>looks</em> like a wraith, there's no reason to stop when
you swing at it.  But a vampire...a vampire still looks like it did in
life, mostly."  He paused, staring off into distant and very painful
memories.
</p>

<p>
"I remember my old friend Astrid after she was converted," he
continued miserably.  "She stood just outside the camp looking just
like she had at my last birthday party.  She was one of our greatest
bioresearchers, and one of the gentlest souls I've ever known; she
wouldn't even kill flies or spiders.  But there she stood, laughing
and mocking us as she fed on the daughter of one of my captains.  She
would pause every few rounds to call out to one of the people on the
walls with me, reciting the names and descriptions of friends and
loved ones who had been converted and how much they had suffered.  It
was all I could do to keep the men from charging out to kill her, but
that was just what they wanted, for us to leave the safety of the
camp."
</p>

<p>
He sighed, suddenly looking very old.  "You have to understand, all of
our cities were linked by Teleportation Circles.  Some people even had
houses that existed in multiple cities at once&mdash;my friend Klaus
had his master bedroom in Halsaland and his guest wing in Akarnhamr,
with Circles in the hallways to connect them.  Once Halsaland fell,
the drauga spread like lightning through the entire nation.  Within
two days, almost everywhere had been converted.  There were a few
holdouts&mdash;military camps with restricted access, the homes of
various misanthropes, the <em>Sky Slayer</em>, and so on.  The drauga
moved on those places quickly, teleporting as near as possible and
then marching overland to conquer directly.  Within a week, only a
handful of us remained."
</p>

<p>
He sighed, rubbing his face tiredly.  When he looked up again, all the
defenses, all the fa&ccedil;ade, had been stripped away, leaving only
sadness and near despair.  "I tried.  I tried so hard to keep my
people intact, and I couldn't.  I was inspecting the Tenth Legion camp
in the mountains when the first wave of drauga came up the valley.  I
knew we couldn't hold the camp for long, and I knew we couldn't
reclaim any of the cities with only one Legion.  We held the site long
enough for most of the men to escape."  He snorted bitterly.  "It was
a masterful defense.  Everyone said so.  Why, it only cost me nine
thousand men in forty minutes!"  The brief moment of sarcastic mania
dispersed; he sat quietly for a moment, and then continued in a voice
so low I had to strain to hear it.  "Behold the genius of High Marshal
L&ouml;fgren, youngest of his rank in over a century and famed for his
brilliance."
</p>

<p>
Again he fell silent.  I let him have his moment; when Thomas shifted
his weight impatiently I waved him quiet.  We were getting good data,
there was no reason to push.
</p>

<p>
Eventually Albrecht picked up the thread again.  "Once we had
evacuated, I sent the men out to collect every person within a day's
march, then I got us out of there.  We went deeper into the mountains;
for two years I played chase-and-catch with the drauga.  We trapped
them, ambushed them, wiped them out.  I knew that I couldn't reclaim
the country before they killed everyone, but I also knew that once the
country was converted there wouldn't be any new bodies, that they
would have no way to replace losses."  His voice dropped to a furious
hiss.  "All I had to do was grind...them...down."
</p>

<p>
A grim, vicious smile twitched at his lips for a moment, only to fade
back into that haunted look.  "They kept sending them at us, and we
kept killing them.  The lesser drauga are stupid, you see.  Stupid
and, except for the vampires, they have no casters.  I lost count of
how many we killed...half a million?  A million?  More?  I honestly
don't know.  But we were being slowly whittled down.  Every battle
we'd lose a few troops.  Mostly we could destroy the drauga they
became and then resurrect them, but every so often they would escape
and we couldn't recover those soldiers.  Between my original Tenth
Legion and various other troops we had met on the way, I had started
with over twenty three thousand soldiers; after two years I was down
to nineteen&mdash;decimation twice over.  Plus, there were the
civilians to consider.  We kept seeking them out and they kept turning
up, more and more of them, mostly refugees from towns and cities that
had been sacked.  By that time, we had more of them than we could
really care for.  We were always on the move, there was never enough
food, never enough healers, we couldn't provide enough clothing or
gear.  And my people just kept dying, and dying, and dying...."
</p>

<p>
He sighed, staring blankly at his hands.  "After a time, we couldn't
afford to fight any more, so I broke contact and looked for a place to
hide.  That was when we found how bad things really were; the lichs
were in control now, and they weren't about to let us escape.  I think
they'd considered us a minor issue until then&mdash;they were winning
slowly, so even though it was costing them a lot of footsoldiers they
were content to eat us away slowly while they dealt with more
interesting issues.  But when we stopped fighting and started
retreating...well, suddenly we were a threat again.  They couldn't
afford to allow a large human colony to exist, perhaps to grow strong
enough to challenge them.
</p>

<p>
"My outriders found the enemy army while they were still three days
away.  A quarter million drauga, they estimated. Mixed
force&mdash;zombies and wights for basic infantry, wraiths for
infilitration and formation disruption, and multiple companies of
vampire casters. Worst of all, though, they had a lich, Afi, for their
general.  Afi is one of the old ones&mdash;thousands of years old at
least. He'd been a general and battlemage in life, and he was a
terrifying enemy in death.  He and I, we fought up and down that
mountain range for months.  They outnumbered us, so I stuck with
ambush, distraction, deception, and retreat.  We made heavy use of
Teleportation Circles to keep the range open, but even with Circles it
takes time to move that many people around.  We had no way to prevent
Scrying on a group that size, and some of the drauga had known some of
us personally while they were alive&mdash;many of our former friends
and relatives were in that army, and knowing your target makes it much
easier to Scry them.  They used their knowledge of us to keep a steady
lock on our position.  We had some anti-divination ability, of course,
but not enough to cover all of us."
</p>

<p>
He sighed again and shifted position.  Watching him, I suddenly
believed that he was almost five hundred years old; every one of those
years rested on him like a weight.  
</p>

<p>
"That was when I staged the raid on the warehouse district of
Halsaland.  I sent eight thousand men; they Circled into one of the
primary complexes and stripped it bare.  Yanked out everything down to
the walls, left the place empty as a miser's heart.  Mostly what I
wanted was the shipping containers.  In the Union, we ship goods in
Portable Holes&mdash;it's standard.  They're much better than Handy
Haversacks; you can put far more in a Hole, and they weigh less.  You
pile the stuff in, pick up the Hole, and teleport to your destination;
shipping time is really just the time to load and unload; between
Holes and Teleportation Circles, you can move thousands of tons of
gear in a few hours.  That warehouse complex had tens of thousands of
them.  Also thousands of Bottles of Air, for when it was necessary to
ship live freight.
</p>

<p>
"Every Legion has multiple spell engines assigned to it.  Many of ours
had been lost during the scramble to get out of the camp back in the
beginning, and others had been destroyed in the intervening years, but
we still had some, including two of Fire Seeds and one of Explosive
Runes.  I had been stockpiling Explosive Runes for months; we shoveled
them into the Portable Holes along with all the Fire Seeds and oil we
could pack in, then sent them off with an invisible flying squad to
attack Afi and his troops.  We had successfully broken contact earlier
in the week, so Afi's army was camped while he was busy trying to
relocate us. I knew they wouldn't be able to get close enough to
attack him directly without being spotted, but his vampires...those
were another matter.
</p>

<p>
"My men got in close to the supply trains that carried the vampires'
coffins, then dumped out everything in their Portable Holes.  Hundreds
of Fire Seeds, hundreds of thousands of Explosive Runes.  The runes
were etched onto small metal disks; my men used spyglasses and Eyes of
the Eagle to read them from above; the explosion was monumental.
Right after, they pulled out a bunch of Celestial Brilliance stones
and strafed the bastards.  Lay twenty or thirty 'Brilliances on top of
each other and any undead pretty much goes to ash the second the light
touches them."
</p>

<p>
He wore a very grim smile as he continued, he eyes lost in a
satisfying memory.  "We killed thousands of them in that attack,
including almost their entire vampire corps, who had been their
primary caster contingent.  More specifically, we killed the ones that
knew us best, making it harder for them to Scry on us."
</p>

<p>
The smile faded.  "Of course, we lost that entire squad.  Within
moments of the attack, Afi disrupted their invisibility and
slaughtered them all.  One of them got a Sending off before he died,
so at least we knew they were successful."
</p>

<p>
Again he fell to silence, and again I let him wait.  Thomas stood like
a statue, but the muscle in his jaw was jumping as he ground his
teeth; he was getting impatient.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht took a deep breath and let it out, then looked up at me with
a shrug.  "That's most of the story.  We escaped, and eventually found
refuge here.  This used to be the home of a friend, a deep gnome mage
named Snorri.  He liked being undisturbed, so centuries ago he
installed a weirdstone to keep anyone from teleporting in without
notice.  I'd been here before, but I didn't know where this place was
physically, so we had to use Sending spells to get his permission so
we could teleport in."  Again that brief lip-twitch of momentary humor
as he remembered the conversation.  "He didn't even know about the
drauga attacking.  He'd been mewed up in here for a couple of decades
without talking to anyone, working on a research paper.  I told him
that I had some gear for him that would be helpful in his research,
and could he please lower his wards?"
</p>

<p>
The tiny half-smile turned sad again.  "He was a good friend and I
hated tricking him, but I had over a quarter million people depending
on me by then and I wasn't sure he'd say yes if I told him everything.
I lied through my teeth with a smile on my face and he lowered his
wards.  I sent commandos through first, invisible and Hasted, with
orders to secure Snorri and the weirdstone.  As soon as they were away
we sent an advance guard and then started shipping the civilians
through as fast as we could."
</p>

<p>
His face crumpled as his memory came to the next part.  "Afi found us
while we were still evacuating.  Gods, that was a nightmare.  Trying
to protect the camp while they bombarded us with spells and missiles
and those godscursed wraiths and shadows and ghosts came up at us
through the ground.  I've been a general for nearly four hundred
years, I've fought in six wars and led punitive raids&mdash;even
small-scale extermination campaigns&mdash;into the Underdark.  I have
never in my life seen anything as bloody or horrific as that battle."
His voice trailed off and he paled as his mind's eye replayed the
scenes.
</p>

<p>
I cleared my throat, jolting him out of his reverie; from his look, I
think I did him a favor.  He sighed, then pushed himself to his feet
with a bit of a grunt and wiped the last of the blood off his cheek.
He locked eyes with me (the left one was undamaged by now); his lip
twitched in a hint of secret amusement, and then he nodded towards the
center of the cavern.  "Come, let me show you the last of it."
</p>

<p>
Slowly, he walked towards the central pillar.  Seeing Albrecht move
out of easy throttling reach seemed to push Thomas's buttons, because
he narrowed his eyes in a way that said "I think I'm going to kill you
now"...but after a moment he shook his head and followed.
</p>

<p>
As we got to the pillar, I waved the Landguard back so that Albrecht
could approach.
</p>

<p>
The pillar was incredible&mdash;ninety feet high, and easily thirty
feet thick at its base.  I'm not a geologist, so I had no idea what
kind of stone it was, but it was smooth, slightly pebbled
grayish-blue, and shot through with veins of green.  It could easily
have been installed in a museum and people would have come just to see
it.  A circular tunnel, maybe six feet across, led into the side of
it...fifty feet into the side of it.  I blinked.</p>

<p>
Albrecht's face had a tiny smile on it.  Tiny, but a true smile.
"Welcome to Gr&#491;fhamr, Jake.  Or, as you would call it,
Hole-home."   
</p>

<p>
I looked at him blankly for a moment and then my eyes widened as I got
it.  "It's <em>all</em> Portable Holes?  Nested, one inside the other?"
</p>

<p>
He nodded, grim amusement on his face.  "Indeed.  Well, not all.  We
don't have nearly enough Holes to accomodate everyone, so we also use
Rope Trick, Mage's Magnificent Mansion...anything that will get us
some extra space.  Mostly Rope Trick. We've been gathering people here
for three years now, and this is probably the most populated of the
surviving Redoubts so we need a <em>lot</em> of extra space.  We don't
have an accurate count, but there's easily two or three million people
inside."
</p>

<p>
I stepped forward to enter the tunnel, then paused.  "What happens if
someone throws a Bag of Holding in the door?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht looked puzzled.  "A what?"
</p>

<p>
My eyebrows shot up at his ignorance.  "A Bag of Holding.  You know, a
bag that's bigger on the inside?  If you put a Portable Hole into a
Bag of Holding, it rips a hole to Astral Space and everything within
ten feet gets sucked through.  But if you do it the other way around
and put a Bag of Holding into a Portable Hole, then both are just
destroyed, along with their contents.  What if Afi sent someone to
heave a Bag of Holding through the door?"
</p>

<p>
He looked sick.  "I've never heard of a 'Bag of Holding.'  It must be
something you Flobovians created...gods, that's monstrous.  Who
would <em>make</em> such a thing?"
</p>

<p>
I shrugged.  "Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson, I guess.  Keep it in mind;
if we don't deal with your little undead troubles, they will spread
over to Flobovia.  At which point they will find out about Bags of
Holding, come back here, and blow your whole little Hole city to the
kumquat kingdom."
</p>

<p>
That settled, I stepped into the tunnel; Thomas shouldered in front of
me, but didn't try to keep me out. With Thomas in front and Duncan
behind, we prowled up the corridor.  Thomas and I, both over six feet,
had to stoop a little but Duncan was comfortable as long as he stayed
to the center of the tunnel.
</p>

<p>
The walls were made of something I couldn't identify, completely
smooth and featureless and colored a gray so dark it was the next door
neighbor of black.  I watched them carefully as we walked, looking for
any seams or joins; there weren't any.  The only distinguishing mark
was numbers painted on the wall in white paint.
</p>

<p>
We got to the end of the tunnel without seeing anything but tunnel.  I
inspected the dead end wall in front of us carefully, then turned
around to look back at Albrecht where the Landguard were holding him.
</p>

<p>
"There's nothing here," I called.  "Where are all your people?"
</p>

<p>
He gently tugged himself free of Bob's grip.  "Step back this way a
bit and I'll show you," he called; I thought I heard just a small
trace of impish humor.
</p>

<p>
Thomas, Duncan, and I all looked at each other in confusion, then
shrugged and moved down the tunnel to Albrecht.  As we emerged, he
gave a small smile, then wiggled his fingers a bit and said "Sending
to Brandt the doorwarden: Brandt, it's Albrecht. I'm outside with some
allies. Things are tense but safe. Move everyone back, open the door,
don't look threatening. Authentication: marzipan."  Instead of flying
away, the Sending&mdash;which, for some reason, looked like a smokey
trout instead of a smokey sparrow&mdash;vanished in midair.
</p>

<p>
I stood there, waiting for something to happen.  It was hard, but I
resisted the urge to turn to Albrecht and say "Well?". I knew that if
I did then whatever it was we were waiting for would suddenly happen,
at which point I would have to look all amazed and do a bad Keanu
Reeves impersonation ("Whoa!"), and I simply refused to be that trope.
</p>

<p>
About a minute later, something unrolled itself into existence at the
end of the tunnel.  Suddenly, the shaft continued hundreds of feet
into the thirty foot wide pillar. Not only was there more tunnel
there, but masses of people too; dozens at least, all moving to and
fro on unknown errands.  Warm, wet air like something from a
rainforest wafted past me, bringing with it the faint odor of too many
people crammed too close together for too long.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht made the contented little sound that you make after returning
home from a long day's work and taking your shoes off.  Ignoring the
threatening looks of the Landguard that surrounded him, he waved us
down the tunnel after him.  "Come, let me introduce you all to
Gr&#491;fhamr."
</p>

<p>
As he led us inside, I finally got around to asking something I'd been
meaning to find out since we got into the cavern.  "Where's the rest
of your army? I only saw you, your immediate bodyguard, and those
flying-carpet magi of yours.  Did they not make it through?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht snorted.  "First off, I wasn't ever really planning to bring
them through, no matter what we discussed.  I didn't think the drauga
would have anything like the presence they turned out to have&mdash;it
wasn't like that when we left&mdash;but I knew there would be
fighting. I didn't want them exposed to danger...and besides, the
whole reason that we left in the first place was because the city was
overcrowded and couldn't support us all."
</p>

<p>
I hmphd in acknowledgement and irritation at how easily I'd been
played.  "And second of all?"
</p>

<p>
He flicked his eyes sideways at me and his lips twitched.  "Second of
all, my 'army' was eleven thousand soldiers, about a hundred casters,
and a hundred thousand civilians.  I was trying to get them to safety;
would of succeeded too, if you hadn't scotched that plan by
demolishing the temple."
</p>

<p>
I stopped dead and turned to him.  "What?"
</p>

<p>
He turned to face me, a wicked grin on his face.  "Like I said,
Gr&#491;fhamr couldn't handle the number of people we had here."  He
gestured at the dozens of people moving back and forth through the
tunnel in both directions.  They had to press themselves to the walls
to slide past our steadily-extending column as more and more of the
Landguard followed us inside.  Some of the Landguard were being polite
and trying to clear the way, but it was still a tight squeeze.
</p>

<p>
"Our intelligence told us that the infestation hadn't reached your
continent yet, so it was safer for the civilians to be there than
here, even if it meant leaving the protection of the city.  I would
have brought more, but I didn't feel like I could safely bring more
casters or fighers than I did, and a hundred thousand civilians was
about all they could reasonably protect."
</p>

<p>
My mouth was gaping open.  "But we scouted you!  We saw troops, lots
of troops!  And no sign of civilians."
</p>

<p>
He snorted.  "Please.  Any dirtfarm housewife can put on mail and
carry a sword.  It doesn't make her a soldier, but from a distance no
one can tell the difference unless she actually has to fight.  We were
careful to let your scouts close enough that they could see, but not
close enough to see well."  He stepped aside to let some of the
hurrying people go by.  This group was carrying waterskins that they
used to refill large bowls spaced down the tunnel every hundred feet
or so.
</p>

<p>
"But...."
</p>

<p>
He sighed.  "Jake, an excellent commander <em>avoids</em> battles, he
doesn't seek them out.  Supreme excellence is to conquer your enemy
whole and intact, not to get into giant slugging matches.  I showed
you what I wanted you to see, and you handed me a peace treaty on a
plate.  A peace treaty that gave me everything I wanted&mdash;the
mobilization of Flobovia against the drauga, the right for me to
evacuate our citizens here, and the right for us to convert all of
Flobovia to our religion."
</p>

<p>
Thomas growled in his throat.  "What about Oxport and Tor Cannle?  You
didn't take <em>them</em> 'whole and intact.'"
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, Albrecht looked sincerely regretful at that or I think
Thomas would have literally ripped his head off.  "A necessary ruse of
war, I'm afraid.  I needed to make it convincing that we had the power
I was suggesting; we Circled into the cities, captured everyone we
could and killed everyone we had to.  Those we captured were Circled
to a Redoubt here in Anundj&aring;.  They're safe or, at least, they
were when we sent them.  I've been out of touch."  Instead of trying
to maintain eye contact with the clearly enraged Landguard Commander,
Albrecht turned and continued up the tunnel.  We were starting to pass
side tunnels, each of them full of more hurrying people.
</p>

<p>
I extended my stride to catch up to him again. "And did you actually
resurrect the ones you killed?  Or your men, after I bombed you?" I
demanded, knowing the answer even as I asked.
</p>

<p>
He looked sad as he shook his head.  "No.  Ten years ago it would have
been trivial, but we don't have the power for that anymore.  The
drauga's initial attack specifically targeted our High Magi and High
Clerics.  In all the Redoubts combined we only have
two, <em>maybe</em> three thousand casters left that can cast True
Resurrection, and they mostly need to use their spells for other
things.  Practically speaking, we can't resurrect more than a handful
of people a week."
</p>

<p>
He snorted in disgust.  "Since we retreated to the Redoubts we've
actually had people die,"&mdash;he looked sick as he said the
word&mdash;"of things as stupid as old age, and even accidents, not to
mention fighting the drauga.  A week before we left for Flobovia we
had an outbreak of cholera.  <em>Cholera,</em> in this day and age!
It killed dozens before we got it under control."
</p>

<p>
I closed my eyes and grit my teeth.  "Oh, Loki, you son of a bitch," I
muttered to myself.  "Very carefully worded, you bastard.  'They have
the capability'&mdash;theoretically, but not in practice.  Bastard."
</p>

<p>
"I <em>am</em> the God of Lies, after all," whispered a soft voice in
my ear, and then faded away with a mocking laugh.
</p>

<p>
I jumped a little at that, then decisively ignored it.  "So, out of
curiosity, how many of your combat effectives did we actually kill in
the bombing?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht wore a very sour expression as he answered, "Over seven
thousand soldiers, and eighty four of my casters.  And, of course,
about fifteen thousand civilians&mdash;mostly women and teenagers,
since that's the bulk of what I brought."
</p>

<p>
I shrugged.  "Well, they weren't soldiers so it wouldn't have affected
things either way.  But seriously?  After the bombing we outnumbered
you five to one and had superiority in mages as well?  Or were all the
remaining ones Archmagi or something?"
</p>

<p>
The glare he leveled at me could have melted steel, which left me
confused.  After a moment he turned on his heel and stalked off into a
side tunnel.  I frowned in puzzlement, trying to figure out the
problem.
</p>

<p>
Oh, wait.  I probably should have been more sympathetic about the
noncombatants we had killed.  Well, I'd remember for next time.
Probably after I undid the Archmagi's mindwhammy I'd find it easier to
remember things like this.  I think OriginalMe cared about that kind
of stuff.
</p>

<p>
I caught up and asked again.  "So, were all your remaining casters
Archmagi?"  He flashed the glare at me again, but it was only there
for a moment before it disappeared under what I was starting to think
of as his 'ambassador face'; smiling, friendly, avuncular.  "No, not
all of them.  Two High Magi, three High Clerics, and the rest were all
midlevel."
</p>

<p>
I nodded thoughtfully.  "So we had parity on casters, or near enough,
and we outnumbered you on troops.  If I'd brought up the cannons we
would have slaughtered you."
</p>

<p>
He snorted.  "Oh please.  You're a talented amateur, Jake, lots of
creative ideas, but don't be full of yourself.  I've been a general
ten times longer than you've been alive; I had plans in place to take
you down if I needed to.  Even outnumbered, we would have won easily."
</p>

<p>
I raised an eyebrow.  "Oh?  Do tell."
</p>

<p>
He reached to pat me on the shoulder, then flinched as Thomas stepped
slightly closer with a look that said 'please give me an excuse to rip
your lungs out through your nose.'
</p>

<p>
"Ah, right," Albrecht said, carefully moving his hand away from me.
"Come, I'll explain as we walk.  This way."  He gestured for me to
follow him into another side tunnel.  We paced further into the warm,
humid funk of the interior.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the conversation I had been trying not to spin my head
around like a yokel, but Gr&#491;fhamr was fascinating.  It was
something like being inside a cave that had been adapted for tourists.
The dark gray walls were moist with condensation; in places it had
formed into droplets that ran down the surface and formed tiny puddles
at the bottom of the curved floor.  The numbers on the walls weren't
just at the entrace, they ran everywhere I had seen. The numbers at
the entrance had been gleaming white, seeming freshly painted, but the
ones around us now were painted in dark green, and some of them were
discolored by a slimy black mold.
</p>

<p>
Also, if this were a tourist cave then it was a cave haunted by noisy
ghosts. Throughout our walk I had noticed dozens of bits of ropes,
each just a few inches long, hanging from empty space near the
ceiling.  Each rope was adorned with a unique set of
oddments&mdash;painted stripes, a small tassel, some crystal beads,
and so on.  I couldn't see anyone above us, but I could hear a low
susurrance of voices from near the ropes, along with the occasional
snatch of music and someone singing softly in a rich but offkey
baritone.
</p>

<p>
"As you can see," Albrecht said, pointing up to the ropes, "Rope Trick
is our primary method of making space for the inhabitants.  Everyone
who has the aptitude, we train them as magi.  For every one that we
can get to third level, that's eight people that we can get out of the
hallways which, as you can see, is pretty important."  He gestured to
all of the people still crowding past us.
</p>

<p>
He suddenly frowned as he looked around and noticed the condition of
the tunnel.  His face wrinkling in disgust, he looked up and called up
to one of the ropes.  "Oy!  Yngvarr!  Your area is disgusting!  You're
already in the Deeps, you want to be demoted to water cleaner? Get down
here and clean it!"
</p>

<p>
The rope dropped down to the floor and a short, stout man in his late
twenties shinned rapidly down. "Sorry, General, sorry.  Cleaning,
right away sir!"  He snapped his fingers and pointed at the floor.
"Prestidigitation!"  He waved his finger around slowly like a laser
pointer; in its wake the walls dried up and the mold vanished.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht watched him for a moment, frowning thunderously.  "Seriously,
Yngvar, what's the matter with you?  You were on disciplinary call six
times in the month before I left.  I come back, and it's the same old
thing.  You work hard at your studies, so it's not that you're lazy.
So what is it?"
</p>

<p>
Yngvar ducked his head and blushed furiously, even as he continued to
clean.  "I forgot, sir.  I was reading."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht gave that sigh that mothers of well-intentioned-yet-wayward
children have given since time immemorial.  "Yngvar, you have to find
a way to remember. Talk to Master Erik about memory training.  Talk to
your neighbors about how they remember.  Club up with some of the
others around here to remind each other.  You're a smart guy, figure
it out.  Because, seriously, if you forget again you're cleaning water
for a month. We can't afford another round of blackrot just because
you get lost in a book.  When you're done, do the rest of the corridor
and then spend the remainder of the watch on cooling duty."
</p>

<p>
By now Yngvar was beet red.  "Yessir," he mumbled, looking like his
fondest wish was to have the earth swallow him up.
</p>

<p>
Shaking his head, Albrecht turned back to us and continued the tour.
"Sorry about that.  Water and heat are a problem for us&mdash;this is
a sealed environment, so there's nowhere for the heat to disperse to.
We set out basins of water as heat sinks,"&mdash;he gestured to the
the local copies of the bowls I had noticed earlier&mdash;"and then
have apprentice mages chill the water repeatedly with
Prestidigitation.  Of course, <em>that</em> causes its own
problem&mdash;between the heat sinks and the water that people breathe
out, the whole place ends up dripping.  And that means that molds grow
really fast, and can cause infections and even death.  We lost over
ten thousand people to blackrot in the first six months, before we
figured out what was causing it.  Now we assign everyone an area that
they have to keep clean and dry.  It's easiest for the magi, of
course, since Prestidigitation makes it easy, but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"While I'm sure the details of your plumbing management are thoroughly
riveting, they don't seem relevant to how you intended to defeat
Flobovia with only four thousand soldiers."  Thomas's voice was dry
enough to make every drop of water within fifty feet flee for its
life.
</p>

<p>
"Ah," said Albrecht with just a hint of nervousness.  "See, here's the
thing, Commander.  There seems to be a bit of tension in the air right
now, and I'm concerned that if I tell you how I planned to defeat your
country you might take it into your head to rearrange some of my
internal organs.  And I quite prefer them in their current positions
so, if it's all the same to you, I think I'll hold off on that story
until things are a bit calmer."
</p>

<p>
"Stand down, Thomas," I ordered calmly.  "Albrecht has information
that we need.  So long as he doesn't actively betray us or conceal
information, he's off limits for organ-rearrangement.  Or any other
physical harm."
</p>

<p>
"Could you offer an exact definition of 'harm', M'Lord?" inquired
Duncan with a studiously casual tone.
</p>

<p>
I groaned.  "Come on, Duncan, you know what I mean."
</p>

<p>
He shook his head and carefully examined his fingernails.  "Not sure
that I do, M'Lord.  Sorry to trouble you, we just want to make sure
that we have a clear understanding of our orders.  I wouldn't want to
break my oath of obedience by accidentally stepping on his foot, for
example."
</p>

<p>
By now all of the Landguard close enough to hear the conversation had
the same butter-wouldn't-melt expression of perfect innocence.  Alpha
Squad even had their hands clasped in obedient supplication which
looked ridiculous on their stooped-over giant frames.  God, I hated
these guys sometimes.
</p>

<p>
"No foot-stepping.  And nothing that causes bruises or blood, ok?"
The Landguard all bowed their heads quickly; I wasn't sure if it was
to acknowledge their orders or to hide triumphant smiles at having
spotted a loophole in my orders.
</p>

<p>
After thinking about it, I decided I didn't care too much.  I needed
Albrecht alive, but he had slaughtered tens of thousands of Flobovians
when he butchered Oxport and Tor Cannle "to make it convincing."  If
the Landguard had a way to cause him some non-damaging pain, I wasn't
going to object too much.  Besides, it should keep the Landguard busy
tormenting him and not watching out for what I was doing.  I still had
a few hundred of them to kill off, after all.
</p>

<p>
Although...hm.  The amount of rage that Thomas had shown suggested
serious emotional pain.  Maybe it would be a better revenge to leave
him alive so he could wallow in it?  I'd have to consider that a bit
more.  Anyway, time to focus.
</p>

<p>
"So, Albrecht," I asked archly.  "I think you were going to tell us
how you planned to defeat Flobovia with only four thousand soldiers
and around twenty casters?"
</p>

<p>
He smiled and waved us along as he continued deeper into the complex.
"When we first Circled in to have our initial chat, I also sent
through several dozen invisible commandos.  They hid themselves in
various places around the city and blended in.  Their first task was
to mine the roof of the Landguard barracks with hundreds of Explosive
Runes, and then stay out of sight. On a signal from me, they would
have blown up a large fraction of the Landguard, burned most of the
city down, spread disease throughout the population, poisoned your
water supplies, summoned dozens of elementals and outsiders to tear
the place down, and assassinated specific leaders."
</p>

<p>
All of us were getting quiet as we listened; Thomas was carefully
wearing a poker face, but it was a deliberate sort of poker face now,
not the "I'm completely lost in the grip of homicidal rage" blankness
of earlier.  Many of the junior Landguard were visibly horrified.
</p>

<p>
"I had already planted similar teams in all the other major Flobovian
cities, of course. Within hours of my signal, most of the Landguard
would have been dead, along with at least some of your Special Squads
who have barracks in the same buildings.  The remainder, plus many of
your magi, would have been tied up fighting monsters.  Your clerics
would have been busy curing diseases and purifying drinking water, and
most or all of your competent warleaders would have been dead,
throwing your command and control into disarray&mdash;we would have
left the incompetent and hated commanders alive, of course, to make
matters worse.  You would have still had soldiers that theoretically
answered to you, of course, but you would have had no way to
coordinate them into a real fighting force.  We would have let you
wither on the vine for a while, then Circled in and captured you,
Jake, along with the Conclave.  With the entire government in hand and
most of the country in chaos it wouldn't have been too hard to take
over.  By that time, the people would have been willing to follow
anyone who could keep them safe."
</p>

<p>
He shook his head, the picture of a master gently chastising a wayward
student.  "This is what I meant, Jake.  You're all tactics, no
strategy, and you don't spend <em>nearly</em> enough time on
intelligence gathering.  Yes, you're good at causing big explosions
that kill lots of people, but you need to focus on what really
matters: rendering the enemy unable to act.  That's how I killed all
those drauga over the years: I took out their leadership, separated
the individuals from each other, and defeated them in detail one after
the next.  Just killing random footsoldiers never gets you anywhere."
</p>

<p>
He looked around, examining the numbers on the walls of the segment we
were standing in, then nodded in satisfaction.  "For example, you've
just led your entire force into an enemy stronghold which has now been
sealed behind you.  My initial message to Brandt was coded; after you
were all inside, he took down the Portable Hole that connects this
segment to the rest of Gr&#491;fhamr.  At this point, none of you are
ever leaving here again without my permission.  So, let's discuss the
future of our alliance, shall we?"
