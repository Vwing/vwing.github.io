<p>
In two days, he had resurrected nearly five thousand men?  That was a
quarter of Flobovia's entire army!  Given how complete the destruction
had been, the remains would have been, at most, scraps of flesh mixed
in with tons of dust and rubble. Neither Raise Dead nor Resurrection
would be practical in those circumstances, they would need to use a
full True Resurrection.  That was a ninth level spell!  How the hell
could he <em>possibly</em> have that many high-level clerics in his
army?
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me but the idea that you have that many archclerics in your
service is...difficult to accept," I offered cautiously.  I didn't
want to insult the man, but I needed more information about this
resurrection thing.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht chuckled, then looked down at the food for a moment.  "Ah,
but I forget my manners!  While I've been babbling on, the food has
been getting cold.  Please try the omelette?  My chef is quite
talented; he used to run one of the best restaurants in
Halsaland&mdash;that's our capital, and a lovely city, famed for its
food."  He forked several slices of bacon onto a side plate, added a
healthy slide of the bread and some butter, and passed me the plate.
Mechanically, I tore off a bit of the bread and chewed.  It was
amazing; I could easily have had just that for breakfast and been
perfectly happy.
</p>


<p>
"Going back to that meteor strike tactic for a moment, I was very
impressed with you for designing it, Jake," he offered, pausing a
moment to fork up a slice of eggy goodness.  "One doesn't normally see
such creativity in such a young man.  How old are you, anyway, Jake?"
His words were casual, and he wasn't looking at me, being busy with
his food.
</p>

<p>
I was still stumbling over the five thousand resurrections, so it took
me a minute to manage to reconnect my speech centers.  "Just turned
forty, why?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I was just curious.  You move and talk like a young man, but
you've got just enough gray to have some wisdom.  I remember being
forty; it was a long time ago, but I remember it.  Those were good
days."  He smiled fondly, eyes looking off into a distant time.
</p>

<p>
I was confused; he wasn't that much older than me.  "Can't have been
that long ago.  You're, what, fifty?  <em>Maybe</em> fifty-five?"
</p>

<p>
He grinned that Santa Claus grin at me, setting his knife and fork
down and champing gustily on his bacon.  "Oh, thank you!  No,
actually I'm four hundred and seventy two...four hundred and seventy
three next month, in fact.  I'm thinking I may go in for my
rejuvenation early; I was considering getting some
bodymods&mdash;perhaps even go female again for a few decades.  I
haven't done that in a couple hundred years and it might be a good
idea; keep me in better touch with my female troopers and peers.  You
should try it; it's quite an odd experience the first time.  For one
thing, women tend to be shorter, so you'll be looking up a lot more
than a tall man like you is used to.  I, of course, don't have that
problem."  He laughed lightly at himself, indicating his lack of
stature.  "It's also very different being a mother instead of a
father.  For now however, I think fifty seven kids is probably enough;
I'm ahead of my mandated duty to the Union, I can afford to take a
break for a decade or so.  Do you have any children of your own, Jake?
If not, you really should.  Children are the gifts of
paradise&mdash;well, except when they're being the spawn of the
devils, of course."  He chuckled fondly.
</p>

<p>
It turns out that, after <em>enough</em> shocks, your brain stops
being surprised.  Any new pieces of information, no matter how
astounding, simply get received as <em>~Sure, why not?  Isn't everyone
multiple centuries old and casually talking about being transgendered
for a while and having more children than four generations of my
family?~</em>
</p>

<p>
"No, no kids.  I was married once, but all our kids had four feet and
fur.  So...are you unusually old for the Union?"
</p>

<p>
He laughed, a cheery ringing sound like windchimes in summer.  "Oh,
heavens no!  I'm actually remarkably young for my position.  The next
youngest member of the Assembly is..." his brow furrowed in
concentration, clearly trying to remember.  Finally he looked behind
him at one of his bodyguard.  "Kadja, that would be Highlord Alvar,
wouldn't it?  How old is he, do you remember?"
</p>

<p>
One of the wolverine-looking women, dressed in black leathers and
carrying a sword and handaxe with multiple other handaxes fastened to
her harness, responded dryly.  "Seven hundred and forty eight, High
Marshal; his birthday is the eighth of Heyannir.  This year, he's
planning on a quiet ceremony in the mountains, with his ninth and
eleventh wives.  I've already made arrangements to send your
congratulations and a gift."
</p>

<p>
He pursed his lips in interest for a moment, nodding.  "Out of
curiosity, what did I get him?"
</p>

<p>
"A year's subscription to <em>Communications of the Association for
Conjuration Magic</em>."
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Again that delighted, childlike smile creased the cherubic face.
"Yes, he would like that; he was always a bit of a theorist.  I'm so
glad I thought of it."  He chuckled and shook his head ruefully.  "Ah,
Kadja, what would I do without you?  Truly, Lady Providence was
smiling on me the day you came to my service."
</p>

<p>
For just one moment, she looked away from her targets, meeting his
eyes with an amused smile.  "I believe it also had something to do
with me fighting my way through the hordes of Assemblyfolk who wanted
the post, then arguing with you for three days that a low-class
Legionnaire from the back of Karnsarland would be able to go to
Assembly functions without spitting on the floor."
</p>

<p>
He smiled right back at her, old friends sharing a familiar joke.
"Well, yes, I do seem to recall more than a few split lips and black
eyes among the junior Assemblyfolk that year.  Shocking business that,
how many of them had suddenly become so clumsy as to walk into doors."
</p>

<p>
Her eyes twinkled, and then she locked them back on the Archmagi, whom
she clearly perceived as the major threat from our side of the table.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht turned back to us, still with a fond expression.  "In
addition to being the leader of my personal guard, Kadja is my aide de
camp and social secretary.  I would say that she's a remarkably
talented woman, but then she might use that against me the next time
we discuss her salary."
</p>

<p>
I couldn't help but smile at that myself; I looked away from Albrecht
and directly at the leather-clad warrior behind him.  "Kadja, you do
seem talented.  People like you are paid a fortune where I'm from.
Whatever he's paying you, you should definitely demand a raise.  And
if he won't give it to you, come talk to me.  I could always use
skilled warriors smart enough to remember the names, ages, and
birthdays of every noble in the nation."
</p>

<p>
She seemed surprised by that.  "Hear that, Albrecht?  <em>Someone</em>
appreciates me and is willing to pay appropriately."
</p>

<p>
"Hey, no fair!" yelped Albrecht with an outraged tone and a hurt
expression.  "No trying to hire my bodyguard away from me!  Besides,
she wouldn't go.  She's passionately devoted to me, for all time and
across all chance.  Isn't that right, Kadja?"
</p>

<p>
She snorted but said nothing.  Her eyes stayed locked on the Archmagi,
but she was smiling.
</p>

<p>
"<em>~Wouldn't it be nice if she were actually serious?~"</em> I
thought idly.  The intelligence we could get from that woman would be
game-changing.  Clearly, there was no possibility of it actually
happening, but for a moment I allowed myself to dream.  Then
again...intelligence doesn't have to be shared <em>willingly</em> to
be of use.  I shoved that thought away; Albrecht was clearly an
intelligent, probably brilliant, man and a capable general.  He would
not have come here with such a small bodyguard unless he was
completely certain that he could get himself and his cohort out of any
trouble that started.  Also, it was a parley and so under flag of
truce.  (I felt a bit guilty for thinking of that second.)
</p>

<p>
The plump little general popped the last bit of bacon in his mouth,
his face suffused with sensual pleasure as he savored its crunchy
deliciousness.  Finally he swallowed and sighed contentedly, sitting
back comfortably and sipping slowly at the last of his orange juice.
</p>

<p>
"So, rejuvenation is common in Anundj&aring;?" I asked, trying hard to
sound casual.  "For everyone, or just for those in power?"
</p>

<p>
He seemed genuinely horrified and no little offended by my question.
"For everyone, of course!  How could we possibly maintain a population
of a billion people if we allowed them all to <em>die</em>?  For that
matter, why would you even dream that we would allow people to die,
particularly of something as ridiculous and trivial as <em>old
age</em>?!  Should we allow them to become old and decrepit, infirm
and in pain every day of their lives?  Allow their relatives and
friends the sorrow and grief and loneliness of losing them?  Lose the
benefit that their knowledge and experience bring to society?  What
kind of psychopathic monsters do you take us for?"
</p>

<p>
I was...humbled by his reaction.  It was the only word that fit for
the shame I felt at asking such a thing.  I had long thought the same
things myself, I had just never had a chance to do anything about it,
rejuvenation magic being in fairly short supply in modern America.
"I'm sorry.  Nothing even close to that exists where I'm from, nor
does it exist in Flobovia."
</p>

<p>
He stared at me for a moment, his usually cheery face slumping into
sadness.  "Yes, I know.  By all reports, the people of Oxport and Tor
Cannle were shocked when they came to in one of the medical facilities
back in Anundj&aring;. I suspect the Healing Hand is still trying to
get them properly acclimated and integrated into society."
