<em><strong>Author's Note</strong>:  Still don't own D&D.</em>
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Blades in hand, Thomas and Alpha Squad blurred forward to destroy
Afi&mdash;again!&mdash;and I heard the <em>bong!</em> from Robert's
direction as he shut down all magic.
</p>

<p>
The room around us shimmered like heat waves on a hot road as the
antimagic suppressed the Magnificent Mansion that surrounded us.  The
effect lasted only for an instant before everything firmed up again
and the Landguard found themselves slammed back into their
chairs&mdash;including the suddenly-present chairs that Alpha Squad
had not been sitting in.
</p>

<p>
"Cut it out," Loki said firmly.  "We need to talk privately, I can't
keep us shielded for long, and that is <em>not helping</em>."
</p>


<p>
Afi smirked.  (How he did it with no lips, I don't know, but he did.)
"Ah, the directness of the pointy stick types.  'Landguard smash'
instead of thinking or talking."
</p>

<p>
Without looking, Loki reached over with one hand and slapped Afi in
the back of his head so hard the rear half of his skull crumbled to
powder.  The remainder continued floating in place, disconnected from
its spine but clearly not bothered by that fact.
</p>

<p>
"Which part of 'cut it out' was unclear, O mockery of a lich?" the God
demanded, gazing at Afi with an intimidatingly raised eyebrow.
(What <em>was</em> it about gods and their eyebrows?  How do you get
so intensely intimidating with <em>eyebrows?!</em>)
</p>

<p>
Afi cocked his skull in a way that suggested him to be full of rue.
"Yes, of course.  As you were saying...?"
</p>

<p>
I could feel the blood draining straight out of my face; I was so
terrified that my bones seemed to be freezing, and my hands were
shaking like leaves in a hurricane.  There was an <em>undead</em> a
few feet away from me, just like the ones that Albrecht had used to
slaughter all the Landguard at my demand.  My psychotic, brain-mangled
demand.  An undead <em>lich</em>, thousands of years old, incredibly
powerful mage and other things, who clearly wanted us all dead.
And <em>he had a God on his side, a God who was keeping my bodyguard
from acting.</em>  I was so dead, so very dead.
</p>

<p>
I started hyperventilating, groping clumsily around for a weapon, or
for my Scotch (which would at least provide some mental cushioning for
when the hammer came down).  Thomas was staring at me in alarm and I
saw Bob opening his mouth to say something&mdash;hopefully another
Calm Emotions.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, by the Abominations, <em>enough!</em>" Afi said, exasperated.  He
pointed a bony finger at me like the very incarnation of Death
Embodied; his eyes glowed with tendrils of black fire as he snapped
"Mindscrape!"
</p>

<p>
Something cold and nasty, like a plateful of wriggling maggots,
crawled into my brain and set up shop.  I tried to block it, tried to
throw doors and walls and traps in front of it, but it brushed them
aside like cobwebs, rapidly surveying the contents of my memory
palace.  Almost everything was left untouched until it came to the
poorly-installed fire door in the furthest, darkest corner of my mind.
</p>

<p>
The door was heavy metal, covered in gangland graffiti and plastered
with 'Keep Out!  This Means You!' signs.  It was locked with multiple
bars and a thick metal chain secured by a padlock the size of a
toaster.  None of that mattered; the maggot-presence effortlessly
pushed those locks aside, swung the door open, and stepped inside.
</p>

<p>
<em>The mountain exploded, killing Isaac just slightly too quickly to
let him curse my name for tricking him to his death.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>I suppressed a gleeful cackle as filth-dripping undead fangs tore
Landguard after Landguard apart as they spent their lives like water
to keep me, the author of their doom, safe and unharmed.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>A comfortably middle-aged mother sat on a bench outside a house,
smiling happily as she watched her children play tag in the backyard.
Suddenly time slowed to a crawl; I was able to watch in great detail
as a wall of light and fury and flame rolled over them all.  I got to
see them burn away over the course of long subjective seconds as the
explosion I had used to kill Reynard and destroy the temple of
Herr&uacute;n rolled through the village of Yellow Pines.
</em>  
</p>

<p>
All of those memories (real and imagined) and others were kept inside
that dark room, only occasionally slipping out through the barriers I
had set up to defend myself.  The presence consideringly wriggled
through all of it, and then wiped it away with the ease of a sponge
wiping up a minor spill.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly I was back at the table with everyone else.  I was shaking in
fear, the feeling of those maggoty fingers still fresh in my brain.  I
groped for my Scotch, took a shaky sip&mdash;
</p>

<p>
And hurled all over the floor, spewing up my last nine meals and my
next three just for good measure.  The experience was exactly as much
fun as it sounds like it wasn't.
</p>

<p>
"What in the Hells was <em>that?!</em>" Thomas demanded.
</p>

<p>
"I fixed his whole fear-reaction thing," Afi said casually. "And while
I was at it, I installed a revulsion for the taste and smell of
alcohol.  It was fun watching him get drunk or freak out every few
minutes and waste <em>your</em> time, but I'm not about to put up with
it myself."  </p

<p>
Thomas tried to rise from his chair but was shoved back down by an
invisible hand.  He looked mutinous; I saw his lips moving very
slightly as he subvocalized.
</p>

<p>
His mouth was suddenly replaced by a giant band of steel.  
</p>

<p>
"<em>Stop that</em>," Loki told him harshly.  "The last thing we need
is for you to start praying and calling the attention of that great
ponce of yours."
</p>

<p>
Thomas seemed furious but he nodded unwillingly and settled back,
hands folded on the table in front of him.
</p>

<p>
Loki eyed him sharply for a moment, then snorted and turned to face
us.  The metal band disappeared as he did.
</p>

<p>
"Keep your mouths shut and listen; it's hard for me to keep us
unwatched and even harder for me to be as direct as I need to be if
we're going to do this quickly. All this time that I've been djlwoduue
hzu jlowozkqq;. 3sll slb4ad a0 az ot zoqqpx4z !f dje other gods didn't
notice."  Everyone except Afi stared in shock, mouths hanging open.
</p>

<p>
"What did you say?" I asked in confusion.
</p>

<p>
Loki glanced at me sharply.  "Don't be an idiot.  You can't possibly
understand me if I start talking about als swox wawo allf awbt
/wld0dllq BLEWlg2 axz unless Herr&uacute;n gives you the knowledge
back.  You sacrificed it in the first place."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht blinked.  "What?"
</p>

<p>
Loki's sigh sounded irritated.  "We really need to hurry this along,
people.  I've had to sleo q-6 nx3w qlr0 ahj40 al4 a1; /w0 0s,l lwql
e0d pw flrpqr -e alfp fedl wll, blt e0d. bqfn dlewofny a0eelsl Jake
xpoe .erwflwxlldlw nad ehsp clwpt from the start.  Now, can we
please <em>focus</em>?"
</p>

<p>
He jerked a thumb at the skeleton seated beside him, with the rotting
imperial purple velvet robe and the staved-in skull. "First off, this
obnoxious bag of bones here obviously isn't the real Lich-guy. He's
another of those Ice Assassins&mdash;the captain of the local group,
as it happens."  There was a pause, and then Loki smiled a very
small-yet-nasty smile.  "What's left of it anyway, after you blew up
ninety three percent of his lichpower. He's been ordered to always
work to his maker's best interest, but his maker doesn't know about
him."
</p>

<p>
Unn frowned.  "How can that be, if it's an Ic&mdash;" She froze and
shrank back in her chair as Loki turned his glare on her.  He reached
into his forest-green tunic and pulled out a rubber chicken; with
impeccable aim, he hurled it across the table so that it bounced off
her forehead.  She <em>ow!</em>d and rubbed her head, but didn't say
anything.
</p>

<p>
Loki nodded in satisfaction, then went back to what he'd been saying.
"Lich-boy&mdash;and don't say his name, I'm having enough trouble
keeping this all private and you might attract his patron's
attention&mdash;has a whole bunch of these Ice Assassins.  He's eleven
thousand years old; he's had plenty of time to create them.  About
fifteen hundred years ago, he picked up a bunch of levels in cleric;
logically, he chose old No-Fun-Deathy-Guy&mdash;<em>don't</em> say his
name, you idiot!" he cried, cutting Drifa off as she opened her mouth.
She nodded, acknowledging the rebuke, and shut her mouth.
</p>

<p>
Loki blew out a windy sigh.  "Truth and order, why can't you people
listen?"  He turned and glared at Afi.  "You too, lich-copy.  Don't
even think about sniggering.  I don't need a pissing match tangling
things up."  Afi raised his bony hands in a placating gesture.
</p>

<p>
"Right, good," Loki said, slightly mollified.  "Anyway, picking up
that cleric class didn't work out quite the way Bony-McBonypants
wanted.  Sure, he got some good hitpoints and combat skills and a
fantastic spell list, but he was powerful enough that he attracted His
Fetidness's personal attention.  He started using Lich-schmuck as a
champion, sending him on all sorts of personal sidequests.  Good
enough; the deal came with a sliver of divine power, making Lich-boy
far more powerful.  He succeeded so well that old deadboy started
using The Bonester as a straight avatar.  When the latest tussle among
the gods came along, McBonypants got to go put the beatdown stick
upside his patron's rival's worshippers' heads, just like a good
little minion.  Dudly Deatherson is a bit of a micromanager though, so
he started getting pretty free with the old sockpuppet act."
</p>

<p>
Afi&mdash;rather, Afi's Ice Assassin, but the distinction seemed a bit
immaterial from where I sat&mdash;raised a skeletal finger in a
request to speak.  Loki gave a small sigh but tipped him the nod.
</p>

<p>
"To be clear," it said.  "My progenitor actually has no interest in
conquering or spreading his rule.  He was a battlemage and a general
in his original life; he carved out quite an empire before reaching
for immortality.  After a few centuries of rule, however, he became
tired of the whole thing; he found that rulership meant constantly
settling disputes, managing politics and relations with other nations,
doing paperwork, and other boring things.  He left the empire to
founder while he retreated to his lair in the Underdark, bringing with
him only a few hundred minions to see to his basic needs and manage
things while he devoted himself to research, exploration, and
crafting."
</p>

<p>
It turns out that a fleshless skeleton can still do a <em>really
good</em> creepy grin.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, that got much easier after he started creating us.  He
would send one or another of us to the nearby Underdark nations,
announce the borders of his domain and the penalty for violating it.
Groups of us would patrol and kill anything that violated the borders,
then go on a punitive raid against the being's origin or, if we
couldn't deduce it, the nearest Underdark community.  It didn't take
long before the surrounding nations decided it was cheaper to patrol
our borders <em>for us</em> than to keep getting mauled every few
months because some random svartalf got lost and wandered where he
shouldn't have.  Once my liege's living minions died off, he never
bothered replacing them, finding that we were far better servants."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you want to kill him?" Drifa asked, unable to keep from
speaking up.
</p>

<p>
Afi snorted.  "Of course I do.  Also, I want to serve him loyally,
never harm him or allow him to come to harm, and always look out for
his best interests no matter the cost to myself or anyone else.
Commands from one's creator are rather like that when one is an Ice
Assassin&mdash;they aren't simply verbal orders, they are reshapings
of one's fundamental desires, so strong that it's impossible to refuse
them or even attempt to circumvent them."  He rubbed a bony hand
across his orbital ridges.  "Let me tell you, the cognitive dissonance
gives me a splitting skullache."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, fascinating, now <em>shut up</em>," Loki interjected
peevishly.  "As I was saying, I'm currently using everything I've got
to keep anyone else&mdash;mortal or divine&mdash;from looking in on
this conversation, and I can't do that for very long.  Most of the
other gods have substantially wider powerbases than I do, and are
therefore more powerful.  Fortunately, this is exactly my domain, so I
can do it for a little while."
</p>

<p>
I nodded; being the God of Deception would be a pretty good profile
for someone who wanted to keep something quiet.
</p>

<p>
"Anyway, point is, Lich-boy knew that if he actually managed to
conquer the world, Death-Dummy would be sockpuppeting him full time.
The weirdo really enjoys running things personally."  He shrugged.
"We all have our failings, I suppose.  Anyway, His Lichiness managed
to pull a fast one on his boss: he cut a couple thousand of his Ice
Assassins loose with orders to keep more than a mile away from him at
all times while accomplishing certain goals.  Then he Mindscraped the
memories out of himself so that the next time His Bossiness decided to
manifest through him, the memories wouldn't be there to be noticed."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht got it first and looked horrified.  "Are you saying that the
reason we're still alive&mdash;the reason that <em>any</em>
Anundj&aring;ns are still alive&mdash;is because these Ice Assassins
have been shielding us?"
</p>

<p>
Afi stared at him in bafflement.  "Well, of course.  Did you seriously
think that you'd evaded my creator for years, all on your own?  Didn't
you ever think about how many strokes of fortune you'd had, how many
times you managed to spot a small patrol in time to evade the larger
army that was approaching from the side, the way that you've very
rarely had to deal with large and dangerous monsters at your arrival
sites, the way that <em>somehow</em> you've managed to find small
bands of survivors who were able to provide just the skills or
resources you needed at that point?  It never occurred to you that
someone was helping?  We've been coddling you since before you started
fighting my liege in the mountains."
</p>

<p>
Loki snorted derisively.  "I appreciate the strength boost, Boneboy,
but you're getting a little above yourself there, and we can't afford
that right now."  He turned to Albrecht.  "Yes, they've helped you.
Most of what you've accomplished, however, has been done on your own.
They can't afford to interfere too much or too often; if they did,
their creator would notice that something odd was happening and would
come looking for them.  That would be a disaster; if the Deadster
happened to be doing a ridealong when any of these guys were
captured&mdash;or even visually identified&mdash;he would immediately
know that McBonypants had betrayed him."
</p>

<p>
Loki grimaced, rubbing his head in pain.  "Damn," he said, wincing.
"Being this straightforward <em>hurts</em>.  Gah, how do you fleshbags
manage?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht chuckled.  "Actually, we lie to each other a lot.  Politics
and romance pretty much couldn't exist without lies.  If it helps, I
consider you to be the best ally we could possibly have.  Your
willingness to be honest with us is a literal godsend, and I don't see
how we could possibly survive without your aid.  Thank you."
</p>

<p>
The headache cleared from Loki's face.  "Ahhh, much better, thanks.
That helped.  Now, as I was saying," he said, waving indolently at
Afi. "You and BoneyCloney here have a common interest.  I would
suggest you find a way to work together productively."  Suddenly he
was Marlon Brando in a pinstripe suit and fedora.  "And when I says
'suggest,'" he told us with a raspy Godfather voice.  "What I actually
mean is that I would find it most <em>displeasing</em> if it didn't
happen. Capiche?"
</p>

<p>
No one else understood the reference, but we all understood the
message.  "Absolutely, got it," I told him firmly.
</p>

<p>
Afi hesitated long enough that Loki turned a mobsteresque hairy
eyeball on him.
</p>

<p>
"This isn't quite what I understood you to mean when you suggested
this conference, sir," the lich said calmly.  "I had expected that you
would set up a sensible command structure so that I could finally get
these meatbags working in the right direction."
</p>

<p>
Loki conjured a mirror and studied his own face intently, turning it
from side to side like someone checking the quality of his shave.
"Huh.  No, as far as I can tell I'm still the God of Deception and
Chaos."  He tossed the mirror over his shoulder; it crashed to the
ground and broke.  "Setting up organizational structures isn't really
my thing.  I've done about as much 'honest and forthright' as I can
manage for now, y'all can sort it out."
</p>

<p>
He looked up and winced a little, as though seeing something
disturbing.  Hastily, he turned back to us.  "Ok, some of the gods are
starting to think about checking in on you, so I'm having to step it
up to keep them diverted.  I can keep you shielded for about another
three minutes, but I can't do anything else in that time, so here's
the important bits: gods can scry on you any time we feel like it.  If
we want to make the effort we can see basically everything that's
going on at the target location, but usually most of them don't
bother, they just use basic scrying.  That means they see the area
from one chosen point that can't be changed without shutting it down
and starting a new scry&mdash;which we can do, of course, but don't
bother unless there's something interesting to see."
</p>

<p>
He paused, concentrating for an instant, then continued more quickly.
"Usually we'll choose a spot above and slightly to the side, to give
the best view.  We can see and hear everything that's happening, and
most of us have True Seeing all the time, so illusions don't do crap, but small things like subtle hand signals or writing on a page can escape notice unless the god in question is specifically looking for them.
</p>

<p>
"There's five or six gods, on both sides of this tussle, that have an
interest in y'all and look in&mdash;or try to look
in&mdash;semi-regularly: Deadboy, Magicman, the ponce, me, a couple of
others.  Magicman and the ponce have been putting a lot of effort into
keeping Deadboy from locating you, but the power balance is shifting
and pretty soon Deadboy is going to be able to find you.  When he
does, that's all she wrote; he'll tell McBonypants who will drop a few
hundred thousand drauga on you and dah-dah-da-dah, it's curtain time!"
He paused, looking around expectantly as the lighting glinted off his
baggy gold pants.  I was snickering slightly, but everyone else was
just blank.
</p>

<p>
"Feh," he sighed.  "Tough room.  Anyway, if a god really wants to get
up close and personal, you're not going to be able to do much to stop
his scrying.  One thing that <em>will</em> help&mdash;if you move to a
different plane while one of us is scrying on you, we need to restart
the scrying.  Keep walking around through these zillions of
demi-planes you've got and you'll be moderately secure, especially if
you change directions a lot so that it's hard to get a bead on you.
If Lilo-and-Lich here,"&mdash;he waved at Afi&mdash;"gets spotted, the
jig is up, so I'll be taking him with me when I go.  It's critical
that no one knows you're working together.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, other important thing: most gods don't have the innate ability to
see your thoughts, and none of us can do it when we aren't manifested.
Most of the ones who can't do it innately <em>can</em> cast spells,
though, so they can always just whammy you with a Detect Thoughts."
</p>

<p>
He glanced up and winced again, his muscles straining as though
lifting a heavy weight.  "Ok, the ponce is starting to get really
curious, and I'm having to throw last ditch distractions at him.
You've got about a minute, so get something productive done."
</p>

<p>
"We'll need to set up secure communications," I put in quickly,
grabbing a pen and scribbling quickly.  "I'll give you the directions
for using a book code; it's not as secure as a one time pad, but it's
faster to set up.  Suze, have you got that book on deities I asked you
for back when?"
</p>

<p>
She nodded, fumbling quickly through the Belt of Many Pockets that I'd
gotten for her, and quickly produced the
ridiculously-larger-than-the-pocket-it-was-in book.  I thanked her and
flipped it down the table to Afi without looking up from what I was
writing.
</p>
   
<p>
"Here, read this," I told him distractedly.  "Start on page fifty seven and
memorize it.  Leave the book when you go."
</p>

<p>
He gave me a measuring look but did as I instructed.  He was one hell
of a speed reader; he made it through at least thirty pages before I
managed to finish the directions and toss them down the table to him.
</p>

<p>
"This would be easier with a simple Telepathic Bond," Afi complained,
drumming his fingerbone with an obnoxious click-click-click-click
sound.  "Of course, to be useful it would need to be Permanencied, and
I'm not about to spend the experience for that."

<p>
Unn snorted.  "You mean you can't, monster.  Lord Loki told us that
you can't improve yourselves; that means you can't earn experience, so
you can't pay for a Permanency."
</p>

<p>
I jerked my head up.  "Hang on, that's a thing?  Do you have one
memorized?"
</p>

<p>
"Of <em>course</em> I have one memorized, I wouldn't have mentioned it
otherwise," Afi replied.
</p>

<p>
"Cool, link us up," I told him excitedly.  "We'll take care of the
Permanency after you leave."
</p>

<p>
I had the impression that he was cocking an eyebrow at me.  After a
moment he shrugged.  "All right, who wants to be linked?"
</p>

<p>
There was a long silence as we all thought about having a link to an
undead monster stuck permanently in our brains.
</p>

<p>
"Burning rounds here, guys.  Get it done!" Loki grunted, holding his
hands out in front of him as though holding back a rolling car.
</p>

<p>
"Link us all up," Unn said crisply.  "We'll sort out who keeps the
bond later."  Glancing around the table at us she added, "Don't worry,
the spell essentially works like speech.  It doesn't give any form of
mental control or ability to read thoughts that aren't intentionally
sent through the link."
</p>

<p>
"Fine," Afi snapped.  "Telepathic Bond."  He swept his arm around the
table, pointing at each of us in turn.  Black rays shot from his
forehead, connecting to ours.  After a minute, the visible effects
ended.
</p>

<p>
<em>*Everyone online?*</em> I heard Afi say, somewhere just below my
occipital lobe.
</p>

<p>
<em>*eep!* said Suze's voice.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>*Oh fer Fire's sake!  Little trigger happy there, eh Bone-boy?
Check your aim next time.*</em> I didn't even have to think about it;
that sardonic snippiness could only belong to my lovely Brightly
Shining Mistress of Annoying herself.
</p>

<p>
<em>*Hold you tongue, elemental!  Do not speak so to your betters,
lest they extinguish you,*</em> Afi's voice snarled.
</p>

<p>
<em>*Thhhhppppbbbbtttt!  When my betters come along, I'll be sure not
to talk to them.  What are you going to do, zap me?  Loki told you to
play nice, are you really going to piss him off by attacking someone
from our side?*</em> I grinned.  Allison rocked.
</p>

<p>
<em>*Seems we have common cause, lich,*"</em> Thomas said, clearly
forcing himself to put aside his feelings.  <em>*You want your creator
not to conquer the world, we want to not be conquered.  What's your
plan going forward?*</em>
</p>

<p>
"We're done, look boring!" Loki said quickly, grabbing onto Afi and
disappearing.  All of the items he'd created&mdash;the extra chairs,
the rubber chicken, the broken mirror&mdash;vanished along with him,
leaving a bemused Alpha Squad standing upright back at their original
positions.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht swung into the conversational gap with the ease of long
practice. "As I was saying, our biggest concern right now is morale.
The better food is helping tremendously, but the people are nervous;
the ritual is requiring them to move from their familiar sleep groups
and scattering them to the winds.  In addition, they are having to
permanently give up things that are important to them.  Everyone is
rattled, and that's piled on top of the fear that always come from an
emergency; we'll need to arrange some sort of official speech, feast,
or something like that in order to help them through this."
</p>

<p>
A young underpriest stuck his head into the room.  From his attitude,
it was pretty clear that he'd been waiting in the hall for some time,
presumably not wanting to interrupt.  Oddly enough, he didn't seem
scared.  Perhaps Loki had been shielding things from him as well?  I'd
have to ask next time I saw the Divine Comedian.
</p>

<p>
"Master High Priestess?  We've recovered Archmagi Isaac and Reynard as
you requested.  We got a rider and what we think is a plague bearer,
and we aren't sure how we should proceed...?"
</p>

<p>
With a scraping of chairs, we all pushed to our feet and hurried out
the door.  I couldn't wait to see Isaac and Reynard again, although I
was having a really hard time coming up with a way to say "Yeah, hi,
sorry I killed you, but at least I brought you back so everything is
all better, right?"  At least, how to say it in a way that wouldn't
end with a fireball to the face.

<p>
"In a society without death, Ingfred is 20 years old and has no
prospects. All the good jobs are filled by undying masters of their

There's two problems: how can Ingfred convince a powerful wizard to
