<p>
<em><strong>Author's Note</strong>: Among my assets there is a
D&D-shaped hole.</em>
</p>

<hr />

<p>
"A-a-a-a-sk not what you can do for Loki!" bleated the giant goat.
"Ask what Jogan can do for you!  For a price, of course.  Yessiree,
step right up and try your luck, make a bargain, win a prize," chanted
the carnival barker, his voice positively oily.
</p>

<p>
"Could you cut out the transformations?" I snapped.  "They're
irritating as hell."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, fine," blooped the fetid mess of oil, swamp moss, and bracken
piled in the chair.  "No more transformations unless I feel like it,
cross my heart and hope to cry."
</p>

<p>
My nose wrinkled involuntarily; the thing smelled like rotting fish
and fossil fuel pollution.  "Now you're just being petty.  Pick a form
that isn't revolting, something human that I can actually talk to.
And stick with it."
</p>

<p>
Some small corner of my mind muttered <em>~I'm not terrified.  How
odd.~</em>
</p>

<p>
Harlequin sighed and adjusted his mask, ensuring that it was properly
balanced on his beak of a nose.  "Hey Zeus Cries Tea, you're fussy,"
he grumbled, but his form held stable while he shook his head, looking
at the floor in disgruntlement.  After a moment his eyes flicked up to
look at me, an impish grin stretching his lips.  "Did I get it right?
It's been a few hundred years since I was in your world, and I forget
some of the details. Hey Zeus Cries Tea&mdash;that's how people from
your world swear, right?"
</p>

<p>
I was taken aback; I thought hard for a minute before I realized what
he meant.  "No, it's&mdash;" I pulled myself up short.  It
occurred to me that it might be a good idea to have something to trade
with the Trickster, even if it was as small as the proper curse words
of my world.
</p>

<p>
"Heh heh, now you're getting it!" Harlequin cackled.  "Keep your cards
close to your vest"&mdash;for just a moment, the torso of his costume
turned into a lime green wool sweater vest with a royal flush in
hearts embroidered across it.  It was only there for a blink before it
morphed back to the familiar multicolored diamonds&mdash;"and maybe
this won't be completely boring."
</p>

<p>
My mouth ran away before my brain could engage.  "Of course it will,"
I shot back.  "You already showed you can read my mind.  So whatever
information I might think of to trade with you, you'll know it
immediately.  Sucks to be you; it's going to make this conversation
very dull indeed&mdash;for you, anyway.  It's a shame I don't have
mental privacy...if I did perhaps you could actually have some fun
but, as it is, this will just be one more dull day in your Long.
Dull.  Boring.  Endless. Eternal. Life.  Such a shame."
</p>

<p>
Harlequin doubled over, clutching his belly and shaking with laughter.
"Oooh, not bad!  Heavy handed, too obvious, but not bad.  Ok, tell you
what: I won't read your mind for a while.  Let's see if you can keep
my interest."
</p>

<p>
For just a moment I thought about saying "How do I know you won't read
my mind?"  But obviously, the answer would be "you don't" and I wasn't
about to give the clown the satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"So, back to the original question," I offered.  "Why exactly are you
here?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but that warn't the original question, now were it, me boyo?"
For no apparent reason, Trickster suddenly had a super heavy, almost
campy, Irish accent.  "Nah laddy, wut ye was sayin' was regardin' wut
<em>ye</em> could do fer <em>me</em>.  That be far more int'rstin'."
Suddenly the Irish had wandered across the water to Scotland, and
gotten even more exaggeratedly ridiculous&mdash;especially given that
it was still coming from the mouth of a Renaissance-era Italian clown.
Oy.
</p>

<p>
Despite the ridiculous appearance and vocal changes, Trickster was no
one to mess with.  Like it or not, he was quite literally a god and
gods have this whole "smiting" thing they do whenever someone gets on
their nerves.  I was rapidly finding that talking to one was a lot
like living next door to a well-armed meth head; you didn't know
exactly what would happen, but you probably weren't going to like it.
And yet, for some reason, I still wasn't frightened.
</p>

<p>
Frightened or not, I definitely wasn't calm.  I fought hard to keep my
voice calm and disinterested.  I couldn't afford to show weakness or,
even worse, interest.  I forced myself to picture Sergeant Duncan
sitting opposite me, and framed my physical and verbal responses as I
had when I stalled him before having the 'Guard dungpile him.  "Yes
well, I guess I misspoke, because I actually have no interest
whatsoever in doing anything for you.  Unless, of course, you have
something to offer...?"
</p>

<p>
A delighted grin spread across the beaky face.  A monocle appeared
over his right eye, a black top hat on his head, and a walrus mustache
under his nose.  It looked decidedly odd with the Harlequin mask.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but, that's the heart of the whole matter, don't you see?  I fear
you find yourself in debt to me, and I'm here to collect."  Despite
the mustache, the generally masculine face and build, the top hat, and
basically every other visual characteristic, the thing across from me
had the voice of Dame Judi Dench.  I almost expected it to say "Now
see here, 007...."
</p>

<p>
I frowned.  "What?"
</p>

<p>
Three blackboards appeared behind Trickster's chair.  He (it?)
produced a four foot metal pointer from a pocket the size of a postage
stamp and tapped the blackboards in turn.  "You."  "Owe." "Me."  As it
spoke, the words drew themselves on the boards in fuschia chalk and
the boards lit up with blinking neon edging.
</p>

<p>
Now I was really taken aback.  "What are you talking about?  I don't
owe you anything."
</p>

<p>
"Au contraree, mes ami!  Tienes muchos con el owing!"  A beret and a
sombrero flickered briefly in and out of existence, only to leave the
god's head bare at the end.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, that just didn't make any sense.  That wasn't French <em>or</em>
Spanish.  Whatever you want, whatever you think I owe you, just spit
it out."
</p>

<p>
Harlequin reared back, making a noise like someone gathering the
biggest loogie in the world.  "Pittooie!" he cried, snapping his whole
body forward as though violently sneezing.  A set of wooden false
teeth went flying from his mouth, bouncing across the floor to stop at
my feet.  The teeth chattered up at me in a fine imitation of a TV
courtroom lawyer.  "I submit to the court that the defendant is
encumbered with the debt of prior services rendered, to wit:
suspension of physical laws for purpose of reputational preservation
in re weapon launcher program code named 'Cannon' and ergo said
defendant's assets, material or servicial, may be summarily attached
in payment of said debt.  An it please the Court, the prosecution
rests."
</p>

<p>
Now I was just lost.  "What?  Suspension of physical laws about the
cannon?  What about them?  They worked fine.  And there is no such
word as 'servicial'."
</p>

<p>
Just for a moment, there was a hookah-smoking caterpillar opposite
me. "Of course there is such a word!  How could I be using a word that
didn't exist?  Really, you need to try to keep up."  The clown was
back, slouched in the chair outstretched legs crossed at the ankle and
hands clasped on his belly while giving me a beady-eyed stare. "But,
back to the subject at hand...you say they 'worked fine'?  Boom, the
boy gets it!  Yes indeedy, they worked <em>just great</em>, now didn't
they?  And that would, of course, be due to what was, if I may say it,
a flawless demonstration of the skills and powers of a brilliant,
handsome, highly talented expert, who shall remain nameless but
happens to be me, who caused, at the precisely correct time and in
precisely the correct manner, the suspension of the relevant physical
laws for purposes of furthering the cause of preserving your
reputational status viz a viz the Landguard, by ensuring that the
demonstration in question maintained verismilitude and simultaenously
satisficed the Landguard's needs regarding, but not limited to, the
war capacity of the aforementioned cannon."
</p>

<p>
I raised my hand.  "Objection, your honor.  That sentence should be
taken out back and shot."  
</p>

<p>
The black-robed judge in the powdered wig pounded his gavel, crying
"Objection overruled!"  Loki frowned and stared at me from under his
oversized 'scary librarian' glasses.  "See here, young man.  There is
only one god of trickery and humor in this room, and that's me.  If
there are wisecracks to be cracked here, I'll do the cracking,
thankyouverymuch.  Now, I made it so your cannon worked, so pay up."
</p>

<p>
By this point I was simply bewildered.  "What do you mean you made
them work?  They aren't magic, they run on basic physics.  See, the
generators produce electricity which&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;electrolyzes water into gaseous hydrogen and oxygen.  The
gases are then detonated by current arcing from the ignition wire
causing an explosion which is channeled up the barrel, pushing the
ammunition and wadding ahead of it and towards the enemy at high
velocity.  Yes, yes, I know, I know.  But there are so many failure
modes for the cannon it's not even funny.  The leaks, for one; you
really think that just by cracking the water faster you could stay
ahead of them?  Water is 18.01528 grams to the mole; given the amount
of water you used and the internal volume of the cannon you would have
had over five thousand atmospheres of pressure, assuming complete
electrolysis and no leakage.  That would have leaked and / or pushed
the wadding and ammo out long before enough pressure built up for a
truly successful cannon shot.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, that's not even your basic problem.  How about simple
thermodynamics?  The amount of work you saw produced by the H&O
detonation was vastly in excess of the amount of work spent cranking
the generator.  If that were actually feasible, you could use some of
the excess work to crank the generator and voila, perpetual motion
machine.  Which is easy to do when a god conveniently lends you a bit
of magic but a bit less straightforward when you're trying to persuade
the universe to do the work for you, hmmmm?"
</p>

<p>
My stomach froze.  "Oh.  Um."  I honestly wasn't sure which bothered
me more: the existence and presence of a god, my failure to account
for fundamental physics (ooh, nice alliteration!), or the fact that a
Being wearing the shape of a clown was talking like a chemistry
professor.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, indeed.  'Um.'  The reason they worked is because I decided to
do you a solid, and it's going to be a gas watching you figure out how
to scare up the liquid assets to pay for it."
</p>

<p>
I just stared in disbelief.  "Really?  Phases of matter puns?"
</p>

<p>
He looked abashed.  "Too much?"
</p>

<p>
"Little bit, yeah."
</p>

<p>
He made the sad face, and I enjoyed a long moment of schadenfreude,
telling myself <em>~Don't say it, don't say it, keep your mouth
shut~</em>...but I finally couldn't hold back any more.  "Besides,
what liquid assets do I have?  You can't get blood plasma from a
stone, right?"
</p>

<p>
His head came up and he eyed me narrowly for a moment.  "Are you
condensating to me?"
</p>

<p>
I shot back with both barrels.  "Mocking and condensating Bose,
Einstein.  Because I am on <em>fire</em> tonight.  Water we do next,
unearth some other punny topics?  Air there any subjects in particular
you want to throw down on?"
</p>

<p>
The room went dark except for a strip around his eyes, narrowed like a
gunfighter studying his opponent.  The Sergio Valente musical sting
rang in the background.  "I make a couple of element puns and you
start Greeking out on me?  Trust me, you don't want to punfight me,
boy; I put zephyr of gods into the last guy who tried. Juno how many
divinity puns there are, and how long I've had to learn them?  I know
'em all, and that's the Zeus. "
</p>

<p>
"Troy to keep up, old man.  Odd Izzy and the other Archmagi pull me
into this world and make me play general.  Aeneid five times the
soldiers I have, just to match the enemy. Achilles Deorsi troops all
day long, and no matter how many I kill they just resurrect them.  The
whole situation sucks, so cannon I get a break here, please?  And by
the way, that 'Zeus / truth' pun is a fail."
</p>

<p>
He shot me a dirty look before finally relenting.  "Yeah, ok, fine,
not my best."
</p>

<p>
I grinned insouciantly, licked my finger, and put an invisible tally
mark in the air to show my victory.  That little voice in the back of
my head said <em>~Do not taunt Happy Fun Trickster God, for he is
subtle and quick to zot.~</em> I ignored it.
</p>

<p>
"Feh, fine," he groused, with an expression like he bit into a Sour
Patch Kid.  "You can have that round.  But I'm not working the cannon
for you any more.  Next time you try to fire them, they're just going
to sit there like useless lumps and you're going to have egg on your
face."  A chicken appeared above my head, clucked, and dumped an egg
yolk in my hair before disappearing.  I just stared at him, not giving
him the satisfaction of a reaction, as the mess slid down my forehead
and over my face.  Just before it was going to drip onto my shirt I
reached up and flicked the worst of it off, clearing my eyes on my
sleeve.
</p>

<p>
I glared at him and my tone was scathing. "Really?  Juvenile pranks?
That's the best you've got?  Aren't you the god of humor?"
</p>

<p>
He shrugged and grinned, not bothered in the slightest.  "Hey,
slapstick is a time-honored tradition in humor.  Just ask the
Stooges."
</p>

<p>
I frowed.  "The who?  Never mind, not important.  Now that you've
gotten the sophmoric pranks out of the way, what is it that you want
in exchange for this so-called service you did for me?"
</p>

<p>
"Find what the Deorsi are looking for."  Suddenly there was no humor
whatsoever in those eyes; for a moment, I looked at the face opposite
me and saw, not a clown in motley, but a God.  A being with only the
most nodding acquaintance to natural law, the power to change reality
on a whim and, worse, a sense of malicious whimsy.  My guts turned to
Jello.
</p>

<p>
With some effort, I broke eye contact, looking down and considering my
fingernails for ten or fifteen seconds while I got myself together
again.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I was able to look up; I didn't make the mistake of making
eye contact again; instead, I stared at his left ear.  I cleared my
throat to make sure that my voice wouldn't shake when I spoke.  "We
were going to do that anyway."  It didn't come out sounding quite as
unruffled as I'd been shooting for, but at least my voice didn't
actually crack like a teenager's.
</p>

<p>
He nodded.  "Good.  Find it.  Find it fast, before they do. And when
you find it, destroy it."
</p>

<p>
I quirked at eyebrow.  "What?"
</p>

<p>
"Destroy it.  Split the ground, burn everything you see to ash,
scatter the ashes in several different rivers so they get carried
miles away and thoroughly dispersed."
</p>

<p>
I stared at him in disbelief.  "You're kidding, right?"
</>

<p>
The Lord of Madcap Mischief gave forth a disapproving sniff.  "No.  I
am not kidding, not even slightly.  I want it completely destroyed.
Every stone from narthex to nave smashed to pebbles, the pebbles
ground to sand and the sand dispersed across thousands of miles.
Every fragment, every trace&mdash;pull it down, grind it up, scatter
it to the ends of the earth so every fragment of its being is utterly
erased."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's not even slightly overdramatic.  So, assuming I were
willing to do this for you, where is it?  For that
matter, <em>what</em> is it?"  I leaned back, crossing my legs and
struggling to keep the grin off my face.  I didn't think Trickster
realized just how much he was giving away, and I didn't want to tip
him off.
</p>

<p>
"I can't tell you that." The answer was flat, definitive, no room for
argument or discussion.  Quite literally the Word of God.
</p>

<p>
Hmm.  He said <em>can't</em> tell.  Not that he <em>wouldn't</em>
tell me, but as though something was preventing him.  Eeeeenteresting.
</p>

<p>
"Ok well, as soon as we figure out where it is, we'll get right on the
smashy thing.  In the meantime, how about some information?  The
Deorsi&mdash;are they for real?  How much of what Albrecht said was
true?"
</p>

<p>
He laughed.  "Oh, all of it was <em>true</em>.  Albrecht is an honest
man at heart...he wouldn't tell you a falsehood, any more than I
would.  I mean, sure, there's always a few quibbles; nothing important
is ever so simple that you can lay it out completely in just a few
sentences."
</p>

<p>
I snorted.  "And I suppose those 'quibbles' aren't important at all,
are they?"  The irony dripping from my words could have filled a
river.
</p>

<p>
He smirked back at me.  Taking his own sweet time, he turned sideways
in his armchair, draping his legs over one arm and leaning backwards
over the other in a way that suggested he had never heard the word
'endoskeleton.'  From his upside-down position he responded with
studied casualness. "It might be that they are.  Potentially.  Could
be.  There's a chance.  A possibility of unknown magnitude&mdash;well,
unknown to you, anyway.  Of course, if those quibbles <em>were</em>
important, that would be pretty valuable information, wouldn't it?
What would you be prepared to trade for it?"
</p>

<p>
That stumped me.  "What would you want?"
</p>

<p>
He stared at the ceiling, rubbing his chin like a ham actor portraying
thought.  "Hmmmmmmmm," he mused.  "Hmm hmm hem hm hah.
What <em>would</em> I want?  What would I <em>want</em>?  What
would <em>I</em> want?  Interesting question, very interesting."
</p>

<p>
Reaching back over his head, he placed his hands on the ground and
walked his legs upright into a handstand.  Not 'kicked his legs
upright' like a human would do...he <em>walked</em> them upright, like
he was walking on stairs.
</p>

<p>
"How about you owe me a favor?  Once I figure out what I want, I'll
let you know and you can provide it then."
</p>

<p>
I didn't even pause at that one.  "Yeah, not a chance.  My mother
always told me not to take open-ended deals from strange gods I just
met."
</p>

<p>
He bounced idly from one hand to the other for a bit, then flipped
back to his feet.  "Ok, fine.  I'll be generous; I'll give you the
information for a song."
</p>

<p>
I snorted again.  "Why do I have trouble believing that you would just
give away valuable information?"
</p>

<p>
He laughed, a clear bell-like sound.  "Nononono, you misunderstand.  I
mean I'll give it to you for <em>a song</em>.  A literal song."  He
pulled a thick sheaf of sheet music out of his ear and held it out to
me.  "I wrote it myself!"  He actually managed to sound bashful.  He
even went so far as to make little half-circles on the ground with his
toe.
</p>

<p>
I took the music, feeling stunned, and looked it over.  It was simple
stuff; I wasn't much of a musician, but my grade school had had a
music theory class so I could at least puzzle out the basics.  It
looked like it was written for strings, maybe a guitar; key signatures
were basic, tempo was easy, notes were mostly naturals&mdash;in short,
it was designed to be ridiculously easy to play, and I had a feeling
it was going to work well as a drinking song.  The words were tales of
Loki's adventures; they were funny, and, unsurprisingly, painted him
in a highly flattering light.
</p>

<p>
"You give that music to a thousand bards&mdash;I've got plenty of
copies, no worries&mdash;and pay them each a gold piece to sing it in
the taverns for a week.  Do that, and I'll give you some juicy details
on Albrecht and Deor."
</p>

<p>
I looked up, puzzled.  "Deor?"
</p>

<p>
"The core nation of the Union.  Anundj&aring; was one of their
rulers."  He flashed a grin at me, impossibly white Kennedy teeth
actually gleaming with reflected light from no visible source.  "See
how useful my information can be?  You didn't even know where the name
of their country came from; now you do.  And that,"&mdash;the smile
got wider, literally stretching from ear to ear&mdash;"is just a
taste.  Battle plans, exact population counts, number and school and
level of casters, disaffected nobles who might be willing to work with
interested foreigners...ooh, there's just no <em>end</em> to the
things I could tell you."
</p>

<p>
Something felt hinky about this, but I couldn't place it.  What was
Loki really after?  I didn't believe this was just about songs...I
would have understood if he wanted some sort of worship ceremony, or
riches, or magic.  But why was he willing to deal valuable information
for a drinking song?
</p>

<p>
"I don't feel good about deals I don't understand, and I don't
understand this one.  What do you get out of this?"  If I sounded
suspicious, it was only because I was.
</p>

<p>
He reared back, his hand on his heart and an expression of shock on
the part of his face I could see.  "Get out of it?  What do I get out
of it?  Why, I am an aspiring creative-type person, surely I can feel
joy knowing that my work is being viewed and appreciated?  Is it so
much to ask?"
</p>

<p>
I hesitated another moment.  This was definitely not right.  There was
something bad about this deal, and I didn't know what.
</p>

<p>
Loki leaned forward conspiratorially; his eyes darted from side to
side as though looking for spies.  "Besides," he stage-whispered.
"What would the Landguard say if they found out that you turned down
information that could have saved millions of members of the Land,
simply because you didn't want a song to be played?"
</p>

<p>
Oh, that bastard.  He had me.  There was no way the Landguard would
put up with that; if I declined this offer it was quite possibly that
heads would literally roll.  Well, one head, anyway.  One that I was
pretty attached to.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, so let's say I agreed.  I'll have the bards sing your music and
in return you give us a full briefing of everything you know that
would be useful to us in our dealings with Albrecht, the Union of
Anundj&aring;, and anyone or anything that is <em>in our opinion</em>
connected to any of those things and relevant to the subject."  I was
casting about frantically, trying to think what loopholes I had
missed.  Oh.  Right.  The obvious one.  "And all information you
provide must be truthful, complete, and not misleading."
</p>

<p>
He flopped his head to the side and looked up at the ceiling in
thought, lips pursed.  "Mmmmmm, no.  Tell you what.  You get twenty
questions.  I'll answer them, and I promise I won't lie."
</p>

<p>
Oh yeah, this was gonna go great.
</p>

<p>
"Right, sounds good.  I love this plan, I'm excited to be part of it.
Let's do it," I offered with totally fake enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
Fireworks shot out of his shoulders and popped in the air behind him,
turning into little party streamers as they fell. "Yaaayyy!" he
squealed, jumping in the air and clapping his hands gleefully.  I
sighed.
</p>

<p>
"Welp, here's the copies of the music," he offered, sounding about as
annoyingly chipper as a junior high cheerleader.  A quick wave of his
hand and the far wall was suddenly lined with stacks of pages.  "Once
it's being played, I'll be happy to offer up some pearls of
wisdom. And remember&mdash;no less than a thousand bards!"  He shook a
finger at me, momentarily transforming into an angry schoolteacher
straight out of a '50s movie.
</p>

<p>
"And on that note," a kazoo briefly sounded, "I'm outta here.  Ring me
if you need anything, and all my best wishes to you.  Hopefully
they'll help your war effort."  With a wink, he shifted into a
man-sized soap bubble; it shimmered and undulated for a moment, then
popped in a shower of soapy water that never reached the floor.
</p>
