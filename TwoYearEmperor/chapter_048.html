<em><strong>Author's Note</strong>:  Still don't own D&D.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em><strong>Author's Note, commentary:</strong> I've received several
reviews and/or PMs correcting me on errors from last chapter.  To wit:
Undead don't get tired, so Colborn could not have paid off on his 'run
until you drop' bet with Jake.  Very true; Jake didn't know about
that, and Colborn was too arrogant to think he could possibly lose so
he didn't bother mentioning it.  Summary: Jake's Brainopedia knowledge
has some holes in it.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>
Finally, to all those who PMed or reviewed to say that the undead
should have 'infested' Gr&#491;fhamr instead of 'investing' it, I
invite you to google for 'invest military' and click on the resulting
Wikipedia article.  Summary: 'invest' is correct.  It is a term of art
in the military, and it means "the act of surrounding an enemy fort or
town in order to prevent escape, reinforcement, or resupply."
'Infest' would not have been correct in any case, as it denotes
locality.  Had the undead 'infested' Gr&#491;fhamr, they would have
been inside it; to say that they were outside it I would have had to
write 'infested the area around Gr&#491;fhamr'. (And, before I get
other PMs / reviews on the subject, yes 'term of art' is a real
phrase.  Google it if you don't believe me.)

<em>With all that out of the way, on with the show.</em>

<p>
"Morning Jake," Thomas said.  "Time to get up.  There's a command
meeting in an hour."
</p>

<p>
"leeme 'lone.  geddout, alla ya. 'n' be quiet," I mumbled.  
</p>

<p>
There was a short pause and then the sound of armored elephants
dancing the paso doble, although it was probably just Thomas and
Duncan leaving the room.  I didn't care; I tumbled back into
unconsciousness.
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
"GOOD MORNING, YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY SIR!  WOULD YOU LIKE SOME
BREAKFAST TODAY?!  I HAVE BROUGHT YOU SOME LOVELY EGGS, NICE AND
RUNNY!  I ALSO HAVE BACON WITH EXTRA GREASE AND SALT, AND SOME
DELICIOUSLY WIGGLY LIVER, LIGHTLY FRIED IN PIG LARD!"
</p>

<p>
"oooaggghhh...duncan, i hate you," I mumbled miserably.  "i jez wanna
sleep. leeme 'lone." I pulled the pillow firmly over my head and tried
in vain to will myself into a coma in the vague hope that it would
make whomever was trying to open my skull up with that jackhammer stop
with the drilling.
</p>

<p>
"I AM TERRIBLY SORRY TO HEAR THAT, YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY SIR!  WOULD
YOU PREFER SOMETHING ELSE INSTEAD?!  PERHAPS SOME NICE DEEP FRIED
BLOOD PUDDING, BASTED WITH DELICIOUS PIG FAT AND SLATHERED IN A NICE
GREASY GRAVY WITH PLENTY OF LUMPS?!"  The voice was revoltingly
chipper.
</p>

<p>
"'m pretty sure th've got dungheaps 'roun' here, s'gnt," I mumbled,
trying to be quiet.  My everything hurt.
</p>

<p>
I could almost hear the evil grin, and the booming voice got even more
chipper and, if possible, louder.  "THAT THEY DO NOT, YOUR IMPERIAL
MAJESTY SIR!  IT IS MY DUTY TO BE AWARE OF YOUR ENVIRONMENT AND I WILL
DO MY DUTY!  I HAVE INVESTIGATED THE DISPOSITION OF BODILY WASTE
WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF GR&#490;FHAMR AND CAN CONFIDENTALLY ASSERT THAT
IT IS BORNE AWAY BY HAND AND DUMPED INTO A CENTRAL VAT WHERE ALL
CONTAMINANTS ARE REMOVED BY USE OF A SPELL ENGINE THAT REPEATEDLY
CASTS PURIFY FOOD AND WATER!  ONCE THE ENTIRE VAT HAS BEEN PURIFIED
THE WATER IS THEN EITHER RECYCLED FOR USE OR EMPTIED OUTSIDE THE CITY,
DEPENDENT ON CURRENT USAGE REQUIREMENTS!  THIS CONCLUDES MY REPORT ON
THE PRACTICE OF WASTE MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE FREE CITY OF
GR&#490;FHAMR, YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY SIR!"
</p>

<p>
Clearly, the torture was going to continue until wakefulness improved;
as a first step I removed the pillow and pried one bleary, bloodshot
eye open.
</p>

<p>
And promptly slammed it shut with another whimper.  The room was
brilliantly lit with dozens of Continual Flame stones, several of
which were positioned on a stool only a foot or so from my face.
</p>

<p>
"Anyone who isn't Duncan, get him out of here," I whined.
</p>

<p>
"AS IT HAPPENS, YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY, SIR, I AM ALONE IN THE ROOM AT
THE MOMENT!  ALL OTHER LANDGUARD ARE ON DUTY IN THE HALL, AS PART OF
YOUR PREVIOUSLY EXPRESSED WISH FOR SOLITUDE!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm up, I'm up," I whined.  "C'mon, Duncan, cut me a break."
</p>

<p>
"ABSOLUTELY, YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY SIR!  PLEASE BE ADVISED, HIGH
MARSHAL ALBRECHT, DUKE OF THE FLOBOVIAN PROVINCE OF ANUNDJ&Aring; AND
STRATEGOS OF ALL FLOBOVIAN MILITARY SAVE ONLY THE LANDGUARD, HAS
CALLED A MEETING FOR TWENTY MINUTES FROM NOW!  YOU WILL NEED TO MOVE
WITH DECISIVE INTENT IN ORDER TO BATHE, DRESS, EAT YOUR DELICIOUS
RUNNY EGGS AND GREASY BACON, AND MAKE IT TO THE MEETING ON TIME AS IS
YOUR SWORN DUTY AS EMPEROR OF FLOBOVIA, YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY SIR!"
</p>

<p>
I groaned and hurled a pillow somewhere in his general direction, but
rolled off the bed.  At which point the gravity in the room rotated
nine thousand degrees; I landed on my hands and knees on the floor
and decorated the carpet in a lovely shade of vomit.
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
I slouched blearily into the war room; everyone was waiting, looking
revoltingly untouched by all the drinking last night.  Thomas,
Albrecht, Colborn, and two women I didn't know were seated at the
table, while the rest of Alpha Squad were jamming themselves into the
corner; Suze had a chair beside and just slightly behind what was
obviously intended to be mine.  I had to squeeze around Robert to get
to my chair; when Duncan took up position behind me to my right, the
room got even more cramped.  I really <em>was</em> starting to have
claustrophobia.
</p>

<p>
I dropped into my chair with a moan, tipped my head back, and draped a
towel full of crushed ice over my eyes.  Rationally, I knew that
hangovers were mostly just dehydration, so I had guzzled water at
breakfast.  So far, this was remarkably lacking in helpfulingness.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" I asked despondently, propping my feet up on the table to send
a little more blood back to my poor aching head.  It took two tries,
because I was sitting on the tail of my trenchcoat and the unexpected
constriction made me fall halfway out of my chair the first time.  I
shifted the offending garment aside and managed to get my ankles
crossed on the table's edge.
</p>

<p>
"Your Imperial Majesty," Albrecht said with a bite to his
voice&mdash;exactly the kind of bite that one might have while trying
to ignore their boss stumbling in with an epic hangover and acting
like an uncouth ass.  "May I introduce Master High Priestess Drifa
Hummel and Master High Mage Unn Lager?  Drifa is the senior cleric of
Gr&#491;fhamr and Unn is our senior mage.  And, of course, you know
Master High Mage Colborn L&ouml;fgren, included on this council for
his knowledge of the enemy."
</p>

<p>
I tossed them all a vague wave without looking.  "Hi.  My Imperial
Majesty Jacob the First Emperor of blah blah and blah welcomes you.
Can we please get on with this?"
</p>

<p>
The room filled with offended silence for a moment before Albrecht
continued, studiously ignoring my rudeness.  "We were discussing your
thought about the drauga having a way to grow their numbers," Albrecht
offered.  
</p>

<p>
"It's obvious that they have a method," Colborn declared.  "The
vampires I killed were all eating human infants.  I'd be amazed if
there were two hundred human infants left in Anundj&aring; right now,
outside of the Redoubts anyway, so they must have been created
somehow.  I don't see how, but I do know that those were humans, not
some other humanoid species. I could smell the blood."
</p>

<p>
I heard everyone else shift slightly, suddenly reminded of Colborn's
current not-so-much-with-the-alive status.  I might have done the
same, except that right now 'moving' was about on par with 'stabbing
myself with a fork' as far as unappealing actions went.
</p>

<p>
"Could it have been Polymorph Other?" Thomas asked.  "They were all
casters...maybe they Polymorphed some mice into humans for dinner?"
</p>

<p>
Silence fell for a moment as everyone (ahem) digested that idea. 
</p>

<p>
"Urgh," I moaned, dropping my feet to the floor and sitting up.  I let
the wonderful, lovely,
blessed-by-every-god-of-light-and-joy-and-rainbows icepack drop into
my hand so I could look around the table.
</p>

<p>
"Those spell engines of yours&mdash;can you put any spell in them?" I
asked with a sense of impending doom.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht looked at Unn, who shrugged and nodded.  "Basically.
There are some spells that we don't put in spell engines&mdash;the
Academy has a list, every student learns it by heart.  But, in
general, yes.  Why?"
</p>

<p>
I groaned and leaned my head in my hands.  "Polymorph Other can turn a
mouse into a human, right?" I mumbled towards the table.  "So why not
set up a spell engine of it and turn...I don't know, houseflies or
something...into humans?  Limitless supply of food for them's as likes
eatin' people, limitless supply of humanoids to turn into new undead."
</p>

<p>
You could have heard a pin drop.
</p>

<p>
"Colborn?  Have you seen any sign of this?" Albrecht asked, sounding
sick.
</p>

<p>
I pried my head up so that I could actually look at Colborn as he
answered.  He was sitting still, more still than a human could have
managed.  The look on his face was...scared? Awed?  Horrified?  I
wasn't quite sure.
</p>

<p>
"Hammond certainly didn't have anything like this; I would have known
if he had.  Many of the liches trade slaves as currency, now that
there's a shortage...I was never involved on that side much, but I
recall that Afi never seemed to have trouble buying what he wanted."
He sucked in a breath.  "Oh gods."  He paused, his pale face getting
even paler.  "One time I passed by a slave caravan coming into
Hammond's territory.  I remember noticing that four of the slaves
looked identical&mdash;same brown hair, same height, same crook in the
nose.  I didn't think anything of it at the time, but they must have
been coming from the same spell engine."
</p>

<p>
I stared at him in disbelief.  "You saw identical quadruplets and your
only thought was 'my, how curious...hmmm, did I remember to buy milk?"
</p>

<p>
He started to snarl at me, but Albrecht interrupted.  "In fairness, it
wouldn't have been <em>that</em> unusual Before.  It wasn't common,
but sometimes siblings or close friends would get identical bodyshifts
to show their connection, or to take advantage&mdash;have one person
to provide an alibi while the other was playing pranks, for example.
Criminals often did the same; many bands of thieves shared one face
between them.  Some warbands did the same because they thought it made
them more intimidating."
</p>

<p>
I mumbled something that I promise sounded nothing like 'Buck your
loopid country and your loopid bodyshifts.'  Really.  Honest.
</p>

<p>
"I think we need to take this as a given," Thomas put in.  "Your spell
engines seem able to cast once per round, yes?  Which means each one
can create over fourteen thousand undead per day.  How long would it
take to create a spell engine of Polymorph Other?"
</p>

<p>
"Less than a month," Unn murmured, sounding shaken.
</p>

<p>
I let my head thunk forward onto the table with a moan.  The impact
hurt, but on the plus side the surface of the table was cool.  In
fact, it was almost as good as the icepack.
</p>

<p>
Oh, right.  I had an icepack.  I draped it over the back of my neck;
for a moment it gave me brain-freeze but, considering how my brain
currently felt like it has been vigorously rubbed with red-hot
sandpaper, that wasn't actually such a bad thing.
</p>

<p>
"Could&mdash;" Suze began, then stopped and ducked her head.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht raised an eyebrow at her in invitation, but she still
hestitated.  "Come on, child.  We don't bite.  Jake clearly respects
your opinion or you wouldn't be here.  What was your thought?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," she began, still hesitant.  She paused a moment, then took a
breath and gathered herself up, spine straightening and chin rising.
"Couldn't we build one of those engines too?  And use it to make
people who could become magi, or clerics?  From what I can tell, there
are two limiting factors for Gr&#491;fhamr&mdash;the number of people
with attributes that enable them to be high level magi or clerics, and
the number of experience points that these people have been able to
acquire.  With a spell engine of Polymorph Other you could turn anyone
into an idealized person, as strong and smart and wise as humanly
possible.  Then there would be plenty of people who could be
Archmagi."
</p>

<p>
"And you could send them off to kill undead in order to get
experience," I mumbled, not picking my head up off the table.  "Boom,
lots 'n' lots 'n' lots of Archmagi, yay team." I swirled a finger in
the air in a limping parody of cheeriness, then let my hand thunk back
onto the table.  Duncan had actually insisted that I eat before coming
here, and it was requiring a tremendous amount of willpower to not
heave my toast all over the nice cool table.  <em>~If I do end up
hurling, I'm doing it on Duncan,~</em> I decided.  <em>~He's behind me
to the right.  Gotta remember that.  Aim for Duncan.~</em>
</p>

<p>
Albrecht shook his head.  "I tried that, using the drauga to farm XP
for our people.  It turns out that it's a bad plan.  We tried to Scry
some drauga, teleport in, blast a few of them, and teleport out before
we were caught. If we put in enough Scrying to ensure that it was
completely safe, we couldn't do enough raids to be worthwhile.  If we
did less Scrying, then we would lose a few people every few raids.  We
couldn't afford the personnel drain, and we also couldn't afford the
military intelligence that those people would provide to the enemy
once they were turned.  We got some higher level casters out of it,
but overall it was a net loss."
</p>

<p>
He paused a moment, mouth working in bitterness, as he considered
whether to continue.  Finally he shrugged and went on.  "Most of all,
it wasn't worth it for the attention it brought down.  Right now,
Gr&#491;fhamr is the best hidden of the Redoubts.  In the beginning,
the enemy wasn't really looking for us.  When I started raiding, that
changed.  Afi and half a dozen of the other Lich Kings were making a
concerted effort to find us and kill us.  We were moving constantly,
and barely staying ahead of them.  More and more of our raids turned
into ambushes.  I ended up having to sacrifice an entire
Legion&mdash;over ten thousand troops&mdash;in order to convince the
enemy that they had caught us.  Since then, we've stayed hidden and
kept our heads down."
</p>

<p>
Thomas frowned.  "What about us?  We just went on one of these raids.
Are you saying that wasn't safe?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht shook his head, raising his hands in a placating gesture.
"No, it was safe.  I put literally hundreds of people&mdash;bards,
sorcerors, wizards, clerics, even the few druids and esoteric casters
we have&mdash;on scouting that trip.  They used Scry Location, they
teleported there invisibly...everything possible was done to ensure
that we were safe, or I wouldn't have let all of you go."
</p>

<p>
He sighed, rubbing the back of his head.  "Although, in a strategic
sense, it actually <em>wasn't</em> safe.  I was expecting that the
four of you together would kill fifty, maybe a hundred thousand
drauga.  There are small bands of the living still wandering around,
most of them having high level casters.  I figured that a pinprick
raid&mdash;even one that did a fair amount of damage&mdash;could
easily be written off to such a band.  I definitely wasn't expecting
you to essentially wipe out the entire Legion, and leave the area
littered with hundreds of thousands of glowing rubber balls.  That,
honestly, was probably a disaster.  No minor band could have pulled
that off; Afi is going to know that there is a larger force out there,
and he'll immediately suspect it's me.  He's going to turn the
continent upside down looking for us."
</p>

<p>
Thomas considered that for a moment, then nodded acceptance.
"Unexpected, but it had to happen eventually.  As a point of
information: we were relatively safe during that engagement, so we
didn't get full XP.  Even so, Duncan, Robert, and I gained seven or
eight levels apiece.  I'd say that going back to raiding could be
worth it."
</p>

<p>
Dead silence fell as everyone stared at him in shock.
</p>

<p>
"How...but...you didn't..." Colborn stammered.
</p>

<p>
"We helped slaughter a million undead, Master High Mage L&ouml;fgren,
sir," Duncan responded with just a hint of amused feral snarl in the
back of his outwardly-oh-so-very-polite voice.  "We did it from long
range, but archers get experience when they shoot enemy troops.  We
just happen to have had slightly better bows."  His smile showed an
awful lot of teeth.
</p>

<p>
Colborn demonstrated what it means to 'show a lot of teeth' and
started to fire back an angry retort, but Albrecht cut in.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps," Albrecht said, pitching his voice to interrupt the
argument.  "Perhaps it could be worth it.  If we stuck to attacking
the troops of the lesser Lich Kings, maybe.  I shouldn't have used one
of Afi's Legions for that test, because now he knows the nature of the
threat.  That trick won't work on him again."
</p>

<p>
I turned my head so that I could see him, carefully balancing the
icepack with one hand.  "Why not?" I demanded.  "How's he going to
stop a bombardment coming out of nowhere?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht shrugged.  "Simplest way would be to have spotters looking
for the attack.  The moment that they see the shot coming, they signal
and all incorporeals vanish underground.  All corporeals take out a
few dozen pebbles with Deeper Darkness cast on them, or jump into a
Portable Hole and pull it shut, or otherwise protect themselves.
Meanwhile, they can see where the attack is coming from and they
teleport a group of magi on top of it and kill everyone there."
</p>

<p>
I grumbled at that; he gave me a shrug that was somewhere between
amused and apologetic.  "It worked this time because it was a
surprise; Colborn wiped out the leadership during his offensive, and
when you started firing, the footsoldiers didn't know how to respond.
The ones who weren't immediately under the impact sites of the shot
thought they were safe, so they didn't retreat.  When the rubber balls
started bouncing around unpredictably they were caught by surprise.
By now Afi has had the reports from the survivors and has already sent
out new orders.  It won't work again."
</p>

<p>
He paused, considering.  "Although...it does make excellent area
denial.  That's a very large amount of ground that the drauga cannot
pass through without significant preparations. I can think of ways to
work with that."  His eyes glazed over as he looked off into the
distant reaches of possibility space, considering the implications of
cluster bombs filled with divine light.
</p>

<p>
"Fine, lovely," I mumbled to the table.  "Hooray, calloo, callay, Afi
is badass and we tipped our hand and yay huzzah.  Can we get on with
this?  I'm busy dying here."
</p>

<p>
A thought wended its way slowly through the muck at the back of my
brain and finally pushed its way to the surface.  "Thomas," I said,
snapping my fingers for his attention without looking up.  "Get my
Scotch.  I need some hair of the dog."
</p>

<p>
He looked baffled.  "Hair of the...?"  He shrugged and started over.
"Your Majesty, I don't think you should have any more&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I rapped my knuckles on the table to cut him off and held out my hand
in demand, still without raising my head.  "The cause is the cure, so
shut up and gimme.  That's an order."
</p>

<p>
Reluctantly, he reached into his Haversack and, with a mumbled
"Magical bottle of booze," produced my precious nectar.  Even more
reluctantly, he passed it to me.
</p>

<p>
I pushed myself up off the table enough to take a deep swig from the
bottle.  It burned all the way down and immediately I felt the
headache start to diminish.  (That <em>had</em> to be the placebo
effect; it couldn't possibly have had an impact that fast.  I
carefully forced my thoughts away from that lest, like Wile E. Coyote
and his immunity to gravity, my awareness of the failure in reality
suddenly caused it to disappear.)
</p>

<p>
I sat up with a contented sigh and took another pull to banish the
last of the headache.  I was still a little nauseous, but it was
manageable.
</p>

<p>
"Ahhhh, much better," I sighed.  I surveyed those around the table
with a smile now that I no longer felt like a poorly-resurrected
corpse.  "Ok, Afi's bad news and we can't use the cluster ammo on him
again without being nailed. Good enough, it should still be useful
against some of the lesser Lich Kings, since I doubt he'll spread the
word.  Also, every one of the balls has an Explosive Rune on it. On
average, an Explosive Rune will destroy all the balls within its
radius, although the force of the explosion will tend to scatter the
ones that are just outside the blast.  And sometimes the explosion is
weak enough that the balls inside the radius survive too.  Anyway, if
we do use it again, we could theoretically police up the area by
detonating all of the Runes, if we wanted to try to hide how it was
done.  And we need to remember that if we're using them for area
denial it's a double-edged sword, since the enemy could blow them up
himself."
</p>

<p>
Thomas raised an eyebrow.  "<em>All</em> of the balls have Runes on
them?  You bought a <em>lot</em> of balls, and you weren't planning to
mark all of them."
</p>

<p>
I shrugged.  "Yeah, I bought twenty million and I was only planning to
mark a million of them in case we wanted to do something else with the
rest.  I remembered that Albrecht had that spell engine of Explosive
Runes, so I figured we could mark others if we wanted to...although,
we'll need to get a few more engines going, since fourteen thousand a
day is only a couple hundred shots, and we could burn that off in two
or three rounds using a proper cannon battery. Ermm...where was I?"  I
paused in thought for a moment.  "Oh, right.  Anyway, I was only going
to mark a million of them, but Arros did them all.  I've got nearly
twenty million Explosive Runes packed into ammo loads parked just
outside the city."
</p>

<p>
Everyone shifted, looking a little uncomfortable at the thought of
sitting not-so-far from what amounted to a nuke that could literally
be set off by looking at it wrong.  Granted, it was a very
short-ranged nuke&mdash;each Explosive Runes only affected a ten foot
radius, but if all the Runes went off together, the blast would still
be powerful enough to send rock and debris flying for miles.
</p>

<p>
"Relax, all of you," Colborn snapped.  "The Runes are on the bouncy
balls, which are baked inside the clay cannisters.  They aren't
visible until the clay is completely shattered.  And even if they were
all exposed, you would probably only set off a handful of them unless
you were deliberately trying."
</p>

<p>
I won't say there was a sigh of relief, but the tension definitely
eased.
</p>

<p>
After a moment, Colborn got a thoughtful look.  "Although...actually,
the destruction of one of the balls would generally destroy the ones
around it.  That might count as an attempt to erase the runes, in
which case it would set them off.  Hm.  Not sure how that would work."
</p>

<p>
The tension came back.
</p>

<p>
Colborn was still lost in thought, fingering his waxy-pale chin in
concentration.  "Hmmm...now <em>there's</em> a thought.  If the
Runes <em>can</em> be chained together, I see some interesting
applications....."
</p>

<p>
We all looked at him in curiosity.  "Yes?" Unn inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Share with the class, Mr L&ouml;fgren," I demanded in the tone that
my kindegarten teacher used to use when one of us was passing notes.
I found myself starting to take another sip of the Scotch but
refrained.  I had no interest in having another hangover as bad as
that one.
</p>

<p>
"Not yet, I think," said Colborn with an evil smile that fit just a
little too well with his fang-filled mouth.  "I'd like to check that
it works before we waste time talking about it."
</p>

<p>
Everyone glanced at me; I thought about it for a minute, then
shrugged.  "Ok, get back to us on that.  Anyway, to sum up: Afi, and
possibly other liches, are using spell engines to create humans and /
or humanoids who they are then converting into undead and / or
eating."  My voice shook a little as that last bit made me envision
hordes of undead ripping into helpless infant bodies, rotting faces
leering with glee as they&mdash;I took a hit on the Scotch to distract
myself.
</p>

<p>
"Anyway," I continued, forcing my thoughts elsewhere.  "They can
produce over fourteen thousand undead a day per spell engine, and it
takes less than a month for a given caster to create a spell engine.
They've had at least six years and a large number of casters, so we
should assume that they basically have an infinite number of undead
available.  That about right?"
</p>

<p>
There was an uncomfortable silence until, one after another, everyone
nodded.
</p>

<p>
I sighed and took a sip of the Scotch just to wash away some of the
misery.
</p>

<p>
"Peachy."  I sighed, thinking about the disaster we were facing.
</p>

<p>
"Suze and Thomas were right about the raiding," Albrecht put in.  "We
definitely need to get our casters leveled up, and we might be able to
make your cannon trick work.  It occurs to me that the cannister
rounds with the balls inside them glow, which gives the targets
warning and a chance to hide...but if we took the cannister rounds and
baked them into <em>another</em> layer of clay, then they wouldn't
glow and we could get one surprise round.  Fire off a few cannon then
immediately teleport out&mdash;we could level our people up with minimal
risk."
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.  "Wouldn't work.  The shots we have now are sized
pretty exactly for the cannon barrels.  Adding another layer of clay
on top would thicken them too much so they didn't fit.  Anyway, it
would take way too long to convert them by hand.  There's nearly a
million rounds that would have to be converted."
</p>

<p>
"No problem," Unn said, looking up with a pleased expression.  "I've
seen these 'cannister shot' of yours; they're simple, just chunks of
clay around the balls, nothing intricate or hard to work with. We make
a mold from some of the existing shots, fill the mold with fresh clay,
smash the existing shots and shove the pieces into the fresh clay,
then bake it.  Voil&agrave;, new shot.  Make teams of four or five
commoners, each team with their own mold and using readied actions,
they should be able to convert almost one shot per round.  We've got
three million people in Gr&#491;fhamr; we can convert all of the
existing shots in a couple weeks, allowing for the time it takes to
distribute the original shots and then gather them in again
afterwards."
</p>

<p>
Colborn shook his head.  "Not a good idea.  There isn't enough room
inside Gr&#491;fhamr to do the conversion efficiently; it would have
to take place outside.  Hammond has a Scry Corps, magi dedicated to
scrying on his enemies.  I would assume that Afi has one as well.
Given his resources, it's probably several thousand&mdash;possibly
tens of thousands&mdash;of magi, constantly casting scrying spells to
try to locate whomever or whatever he wants dead.  Any large-scale
effort like that would be found and targeted quickly, and we couldn't
get everyone inside fast enough in the event of an attack."
</p>

<p>
All of the Flobovians&mdash;and me, since I only sorta-kinda
count as Flobovian&mdash;looked alarmed.
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry," Albrecht said quickly.  "They won't find us in
Gr&#491;fhamr.  We're in an extradimensional space right now, which
counts as being on another plane.  Regular scrying spells can't find
us here."
</p>

<p>
"Scry Location can," Colborn added grimly.  "Assuming they knew about
this place. It would be hard for a single individual to make it work,
but with enough high-level casters working on it around the clock they
could find us eventually."  He paused.  "Just scrying one of us would
only get them so far, of course; there's no way to teleport or Plane
Shift into a Portable Hole, so they'd need to find the exit and
determine where it was in realspace.  Once they had that, they could
Circle an army on top of us in minutes."
</p>

<p>
There was a pause.
</p>

<p>
"But the Celestial Brilliance stones outside would stop them, right?"
I asked, seeking reassurance.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht shook his head.  "Those are a solid defense against the
drauga themselves and against any demons or devils they might summon,
but they don't do anything against normal mortals, or against
elementals.  Afi would simply send in a thousand greater elementals to
eliminate our defenses and remove the stones, then he'd be on top of
us."
</p>

<p>
I blinked.  "Then, if they aren't any good, why are they there?"
</p>

<p>
"They give the city time," Thomas replied, speaking with the clinical
detachment of a military expert analyzing a battlefield.  "With the
Weirdstone active, the enemy can't teleport near Gr&#491;fhamr, so
they'd have to come overland.  If I were Afi, I would attack with
earth elementals and incorporeals; they would teleport as close as
possible, then come in underground and rise up right outside the door.
I would send the elementals in first to sweep up all the Celestial
Brilliance stones and get them underground.  The wraiths and such
would rise up on the next round to attack.  In that first round,
though, whoever is on duty here would have time to pull in the
Portable Hole that connects Gr&#491;fhamr to the outside world,
sealing them off."  He turned to Albrecht, a mostly-hidden expression
of distate on his face.  "Why <em>do</em> you keep the door open,
anyway?  If you kept the entrance inside the city all the time, it
would be much more secure."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht nodded, fully aware of Thomas's feelings towards him.  "True.
Partially that's so that we can keep an eye out for incoming threats;
if we're sealed up, we won't know if there's a threat on our doorstep
and we could accidentally open up in the path of a passing drauga
army.  But, more importantly, we need the air; each individual
Portable Hole that makes up the city has ten person-minutes of air in
it.  As long as we're open to the outside we're all right, but if we
seal up people will start suffocating.  We can stretch it a bit by
rotating them through the other extradimensional spaces, and with the
Bottles of Air that we have, but we can't stay sealed for more than a
few hours.  We have contingency plans for defending the city while the
exit is open, though.  For example&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hang on," I said, holding up a hand to interrupt him for just a
moment.  I leaned back in my chair, pondering and flipping through the
Brainopedia.  "Unn, do your people have that spell, Darsson's Cooling
Breeze?" I asked thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
She frowned slightly, curious where I was going with this.  "Yes...?"
</p>

<p>
I nodded, pleased.  "Ok, good.  Nice thing about that spell; it can be
Permanencied.  Let's get a ton of them cast all over the city; I'll
make them permanent and then we can keep the city buttoned up except
when we need it open.  We can have a watchpost outside who use Sending
to notify us of any threats."
</p>

<p>
She cocked an eyebrow at me.  "Producing enough permanent Cooling
Breeze spells to provide air for the entire city would require
a <em>very</em> large number of Permanency spells; we would end up
draining whichever mage cast them of all his levels."
</p>

<p>
With a lopsided smile I took the Eternal Hourglass and the Rule of
Size from my coat pockets and placed them on the table.  A fingertip
push sent the Hourglass rolling towards her.  "Eternal Hourglass, Rule
of Size.  The former casts Permanency, on command.  The latter casts
Improved Shrink Item and Improved Enlarge Item, again on command.
All at caster level one thousand."
</p>

<p>
They all blinked at me, stunned.
</p>

<p>
"You're just now telling us about this...why?" demanded Albrecht.  As
Master Yoda would have put it 'strong with the displeased is this one,
hmmm?'  Everyone seemed to stiffen slightly at the barely-leashed fury
he was radiating at not being told about such important assets.
</p>

<p>
I shrugged.  "Until now, I wasn't sure I could trust you.  Ever since
we met, you've been a little too slippery.  I figured I'd keep a
couple of aces back.  Now, though, it's time to pitch everything in
the pot."
</p>

<p>
All eyes turned to Albrecht.  He pondered that for a long moment, then
shrugged.  "Fair enough."  A noticeable release of tension went around
the room; Duncan shifted his weight back off the balls of his feet.
</p>

<p>
"You were telling us about your contingency plans, Albrecht?" Drifa
offered, eager to put the conversation back on a non-dangerous track.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," responded Albrecht, gathering up his train of thought.
"Commander, you saw part of that when we got here.  As soon as the
sentries became aware of what was happening, three teams attacked you
while Brandt&mdash;the Door Warden for that day and time&mdash;pulled
the city shut until we could mobilize.  If we do have to seal up, we
always have a mage on duty who can take the exit Portable Hole and
Plane Shift to somewhere on the Prime Material so that we can open it
back up somewhere else if it's not safe to re-open it in the same
location."
</p>

<p>
I thought about that for a second.  "Suppose Afi didn't bother cleaning
up the stones before attacking?  Suppose the elementals just rose up
and went straight into the city?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht's expression was a little pleased with me for thinking of it,
but a lot sad for thinking about that eventuality.  "There are always
three squads stationed at the door.  The Door Warden's post is
slightly behind them, alongside the Guard Mage.  In the event of an
attack the squads go out to perform reconnaissance and buy time; the
Door Warden seals the city.  He is allowed to wait up to an hour, at
his judgement, before having the city transported elsewhere.  It means
leaving behind fifty feet of corridor and any soldiers who are still
outside, but it's more important to save everyone else."  His mouth
twitched in a sad half-smile.  "It's a position of great honor and
great responsibility.  Most Door Wardens are only willing to serve for
a year, after which the pressure gets to be too much and they request
reassignment."
</p>

<p>
Everyone fell quiet for a moment, dealing with that thought.
</p>

<p>
"In any case," Albrecht continued. "So long as we're in Gr&#491;fhamr,
we are reasonably safe from scrying, and reasonably safe from attack.
I, and other major leaders, carry Mind Blank items so we can't be
scried on directly when we leave, but it's risky having anyone else
outside the city, since they <em>could</em> be located through
scrying.  That was how Afi inflicted most of the casualties on us when
we were fighting in the mountains; he didn't scry the leadership, he
scried our aides de camp, our secretaries, our bodyguards, or just a
random soldier in the ranks.  From there he worked out our realspace
location, Circle'd his armies on top of us, and slaughtered us."
</p>

<p>
"Lovely," I shot back.  "Given all of these charming thoughts, it
seems to me that the thing we should be focusing on is resurrecting
Herr&uacute;n; once we have the Goddess of Secrets on our side we
shouldn't have to worry about scrying, or having the city located.
So, how do we go about that?"
</p>

<p>
"It won't be easy," Drifa offered.  "Given the attack on the 23rd
Legion, we have to assume that Afi has bent his entire Scry Corps to
finding us.  He'll presumably guess that Albrecht wasn't actually
killed, and furthermore he'll start guessing who of Albrecht's known
associates might still be with him.  All of those people will be
constantly targeted by Scrying spells, so the minute they step outside
the city we should assume that they are being viewed unless we have
protections in place.  They will <em>need</em> to step outside the
city, though, in order to perform the ritual."
</p>

<p>
"Why?" Colborn demanded sharply.
</p>

<p>
She glanced at him and looked away, her lip curling very slightly in
disgust; I mentally flipped a coin as to whether she didn't like
undead abominations or didn't like Colborn himself.  Given that this
was Colborn, I was trending towards it being him.
</p>

<p>
"The powers and awareness of gods can reach nearly any plane, if they
exert themselves," she began.  "In general, however, they are only
aware of events on their home plane and the primary plane of their
worshippers.  For most gods, including the Lady of Secrets, their
worshippers' plane is the Prime Material.  Since the Lady has been
scattered, the call to resurrect her will need to be from the Prime
Material; her awareness, to the extent that she has any, does not
currently extend to any other plane.  Portable Holes are demiplanes
so, for now, any call to her from within Gr&#491;fhamr will go
unheard."
</p>

<p>
I thought about that, not liking the sound of it.  We had to be
outside in order to do the ritual.  If we went outside, Afi would find
us instantly.  If Afi found us, he would teleport a bazillion horrific
monsters on top of us and kill us all.  The Celestial Brilliance
stones, which I had thought were an invincible defense, were about as
protective as cobwebs.  If we <em>didn't</em> go outside, we couldn't
resurrect Herr&uacute;n.  If we couldn't resurrect Herr&uacute;n, we
were probably all dead eventually anyway.
</p>

<p>
I felt the headache coming back and took a belt from the bottle to
drown it.
</p>

<p>
"Fortunately," Drifa said with a secretive smile, "I've been thinking
about this problem, and I think I have an idea...."

<em>The blurb for "One Hot Night" is:</em>
</p>
<p>
"In a society without death, Ingfred is 20 years old and has no
prospects. All the good jobs are filled by undying masters of their
craft, and it's hard to be taken seriously when you are, compared to
everyone around you, an infant.  Fortunately, he has a solution:
undergo an illegal transformation and sell the memory to The
Experiental Herald for a ridiculous sum.
</p>

<p>
There's two problems: how can Ingfred convince a powerful wizard to
risk his mage license and his freedom to help with such a crazy plan?
And, once that's done...how will Ingfred deal with the law?"
