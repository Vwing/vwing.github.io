<p>
"No worries, lad," Reynard told me with a chuckle.  "Not like I
haven't been dead before; it's actually quite restful after a while.
You get to catch up with old friends, find out how people's afterlives
are going, maybe play a few games of table tennis and Pop The
Bunderbie with the archons, then head home when the call comes.  And
these fine folk," he nodded to Drifa. "Were kind enough to use a True
Resurrection, so I don't even have to worry about lost levels.  You
have my thanks, madam."  He raised his glass in salute to her with a
respectful nod.
</p>

<p>
I eyed the glass regretfully, while making sure to stay out of
sniffing range.  My lovely Cire Perdue...lost to me forever.  I mean,
really! An <em>infinite supply</em> of the best Scotch in the world,
and I couldn't so much as sniff it, ever again.  Of course, if I could
manage to get the bottle home with me, the smell would be quite
thoroughly masked by the aroma of all the lovely heaping piles of
money I'd be rolling around in.  'Half a million dollars a bottle'
plus 'an infinite supply' equals 'ludicrous wealth.'  And yes, supply
and demand blah blah blah monopoly pricing, so hush.
</p>

<p>
As tolerant as Reynard seemed about the whole matter, Isaac was much
less sanguine.
</p>

<p>
"So, it was just a ruse then?" he demanded.  "I suppose it should have
been apparent that you wouldn't&mdash;I should have deduced it from
the first."  He sniffed derisively.  "Should have been immediately
apparent when you didn't explain what it was I was Polymorphing the
rock into."
</p>

<p>
I grimaced.  "Really, I can't tell you how sorry I am, Isaac.  Please,
is there any way I can make this right?"
</p>

<p>
He glanced at me, snorted slightly, and stared at his hands.  The
expression on his face was strange: angry but...sad?  Was he sad that
I'd betrayed him?  That his <em>ruler</em> had betrayed him?
</p>

<p>
No, wait.  That verbal stumble a moment ago&mdash;"should have been
apparent you wouldn't."  Wouldn't what?  Trust him?  Forgive him for
messing with me?  Something else?  I cast my mind back over what I'd
said to him before sending him off to be a multi-megaton suicide
bomber.
</p>

<p>
<em>Why would you ask me, My Lord?  Wouldn't it be better to have one
of these new Archmagi handle whatever is so important?  After all,
aren't they now the best magi in the nation?</em> he had asked.
</p>

<p>
<em>It'll change the entire course of the parley, and it could
potentially end the entire war, right then and there,</em> I had
answered.  Hm.
</p>

<p>
"Isaac, again, I'm very sorry I tricked you," I told him, trying to
make my sincerity as obvious as possible.  "That said, I hope you can
forgive me, because I truly do need your advice.  As I understand it,
you're Flobovia's primary arcane expert on extraplanar phenomena, and
we need that expertise.  Everything we're dealing with right now ties
somehow into extradimensional issues&mdash;how much scrying protection
we get from the demiplanes formed by the Portable Holes that we're
sitting in, the fact that at least some of the liches have probably
hidden their phylacteries on other planes, the question of whether we
can try Gating in things that could grant us Wishes without the gods
stepping on us&mdash;shoot, even the gods!  They seem to be getting
all up in our grill lately, and I have a feeling that&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Isaac surged to his feet, stretching his leg vigorously and wincing.
"Beg your pardon, M'Lord, but I don't recover from death as quickly as
I used to.  Could we continue this while we walk, so that I can get
rid of these cramps?"  He raised his eyebrows inquiringly, already
leaning towards the door.
</p>

<p>
Puzzled, I shrugged and pushed myself up to my feet.  It was a weird
request, but right now I was willing to grant Isaac much more than a
quick perambulation.  "Sure, no problem.  Come on, everyone."  The
others all rose as I did; the Landguard formed up around us and we
moved out.
</p>

<p>
I started to pick up where I'd left off in my conversation with Isaac
but he waved me to silence.  We were a good thirty feet down the
corridor before he spoke, scratching his nose at the same time so that
his mouth was obscured.
</p>

<p>
"Speak carefully," he said quietly.  Before continuing, he waited
until we'd stepped into the next corridor segment, and therefore into
a different Portable Hole and a different plane of existence.  "If, as
you said, Loki"&mdash;he paused, again waiting until we'd changed
Holes&mdash;"warned us that the gods were scrying on us from more than
curiosity"&mdash;another pause&mdash;"then we need to be very careful.
Keep your mouth covered and spread your words out over corridor
boundaries.  Also, speak quietly so the sound doesn't travel."
</p>

<p>
Immediately, the Landguard all started reciting "Red leather yellow
leather watermelon fuzzball watermelon fuzzball, red leather yellow
leather watermelon fuzzball watermelon fuzzball" just loud enough to
be distracting, but also just loud enough to drown out the sound of
hushed voices from those of us who walked between them.
</p>

<p>
Isaac and I were walking abreast (with some difficulty), Suze was
practicaly stepping on my heels with Drifa and Reynard immediately
behind her, while Albrecht and Colborn paced in front of us.  We all
exchanged glances at the Landguard's antics and shrugged; at this
point, I wasn't even surprised that the Landguard had a drill for
covering a private conversation in a semi-public area.  They even
spoke slightly out of sync with each other so that each version of the
nonsense mantra overlapped with the ones around it to form a
nigh-maddening yet nigh-impenetrable sound baffle.
</p>

<p>
Isaac pulled Suze's transcript of the conversation with Loki and Afi
out of his belt pouch, keeping it carefully folded so that it couldn't
be seen from any angle other than his own.  He skimmed through it once
more, then tucked it away again.
</p>

<p>
"That was well done, young lady," he told her with a complimentary
(yet slightly patronizing) tone, carefully splitting his words across
corridor segments for safety.  "However, it should be noted that if
you take notes in the future, it will be essential for you to keep the
pages covered so that no one scrying on us can read them.  Also,
ensure that you don't leave them lying around uncovered. Assume that
you are constantly being watched and you need to keep this information
secret...because you are and you do.  If you don't feel you can do
that, don't take notes."  He waited until she gave him a wide-eyed
nod, then turned back to me.
</p>

<p>
"Concerning the gods, I assume you noticed Loki's hints?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
I nodded.  "'Most of the other gods have substantially wider
powerbases than I do, and are therefore more powerful.'  Gods have a
powerbase of varying size, and that directly determines their place in
the pecking order; he's hinting that it's the number of worshippers."
</p>

<p>
"That's been a theory for a long time, that the gods are powered by
the belief of their followers," Drifa put in, also taking care to
spread her words across universes (because having an in-universe
conversation was so much less meta).  "But it begs the
question&mdash;if it's true that the gods' power depends on the number
of their worshippers and without worshippers they have no power, then
how would they have any worshippers in the first place if they didn't
have the power to attract them?"
</p>

<p>
I shrugged.  "There's a lot of literary theory back in the
real&mdash;back in my world, about how people create the gods. It says
that someone tells a story, lots of people like the story and start
telling it, eventually the story takes on a life of its
own&mdash;literally.  In other words, people create gods, not the
other way around."
</p>

<p>
A thought suddenly struck me.  "One of the first things that Loki ever
wanted from me was to have a song of his played in all the bars of
Capital City," I pointed out.  "That would tie in nicely with the
'worship is life' idea&mdash;Loki wanted to improve his brand
recognition in a market where he was underpresented."
</p>

<p>
Colborn gave me an exasperated glare.
</p>

<p>
"Loki wanted to be better known by a group of people who didn't know
him," I translated.  Colborn gave a 'was that so hard?' snort.  I
snickered very softly to myself.
</p>

<p>
"The theory of worship as a divine definer does appear well supported
by the evidence," Isaac suggested.
</p>

<p>
Drifa didn't seem too pleased at the idea that the gods&mdash;and, by
extension <em>her</em> god&mdash;were simply their worshippers' Author
Tracts writ large, but she chimed in gamely.  "It's also supported by
the ritual we're using to resurrect Herr&uacute;n: a series of
sacrifices from people who desperately want her help, who believe that
she <em>can</em> help them and that they have nowhere else to turn.
Is it possible that we aren't regathering her fragments so much as we
are recreating her?"
</p>

<p>
Reynard hmmed.  "The implication then, is that if the number of
worshippers determines the god's power, then gaining worshippers makes
them stronger, and killing their worshippers makes them weaker...which
lines up nicely with Loki's comment about how Lichboy 'got to go put
the beatdown stick upside his patron's rival's worshippers' heads'."
</p>

<p>
I groaned.  "That's what Loki meant when he mentioned the 'latest
tussle among the gods'.  This whole Apocalypse that we're dealing
with...this is just the gods embargoing each other's worship to change
their place in the pecking order.  If they can't recruit more
worshippers of their own, they can gain relative power by decreasing
everyone else's...either by killing them or getting them to switch who
they worship, the way the 'True God' did with the Landguard." I
couldn't help doing the verbal air quotes on 'True God', but at least
I kept my hands still.  "And if they manage to completely shut down
worship for a god, the way they seem to have done for Herr&uacute;n,
then that god is gone and her spot in the hierarchy is up for grabs."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht suddenly wore a weasel's smile.  "If we assume that the
undead are all, or at least mostly, worshippers of 'Deadboy'"&mdash;he
smiled at the name&mdash;"then by exterminating the small fry, we
actually <em>are</em> making progress."
</p>

<p>
Unn nodded, excited.  "And it could be critical too.  Loki mentioned
that 'Magicman' and 'the ponce'"&mdash;Thomas winced at the insulting
nickname for his deity&mdash;"were trying to keep 'Deadboy' from
finding us, but they were losing that battle.  If we can decrease
Deadboy's power, we can prevent him from finding us."  She paused,
then smiled.  "I quite like these names, actually."
</p>

<p>
Thomas and Drifa both shot her an irritated glare but it rolled off
of Unn's ultimate defense: the Obliviousness Shield.
</p>

<p>
"Actually, that conversation did us a lot of good," I remarked.
"After Icefi fixed my head, I'm thinking clearly again instead of
dealing with PTSD and becoming a boozehound.  And we have a way that
we can actually make an impact on this whole scenario.  We don't have
to beat Af&mdash;Lich-guy.  We just have to reduce the power of his
patron enough that the other gods can keep him down.  If he stops
trying to sockpuppet Lichboy,"&mdash;it was my turn to smile at the
disrespectful nicknames&mdash;"then Lichboy will stop trying to
conquer everything in sight and everything is hugs and puppies again."
</p>

<p>
"Also, Loki apprised us of the fact that we <em>can</em> destroy these
liches, how many there were, and how many remain," Isaac inserted.
</p>

<p>
I glanced at him inquisitively.  
</p>

<p>
He harumphed.  "It's elementary arithmetic.  He said that your water
cannon attack destroyed 'ninety three percent' of the liches that were
in that creature's force.  Fifty three Ice Assassins were captured
after the attack.  If that represents seven percent of the creature's
force, then the force must have originally contained seven hundred and
fifty seven members.  If at least one of them&mdash;the one you spoke
to&mdash;was not killed or captured, that implies that not all of them
were present in the canyon.  We can assume that all of the Ice
Assassins that were in the canyon were either killed or captured, since
any that weren't killed and weren't drained of their magic would have
fought.
</p>

<p>
"Now, it stands to reason that the one you spoke to wasn't the only
survivor."  He sniffed derisively.  "We really need some system of
identifying these creatures; it is not appropriate to use their
creator's name, yet there don't seem to be any other distinguishing
characteristics.  In any case, given the evidence available to us and
the postulate that this one wasn't the sole survivor, we can deduce
that there is a secondary corps nearby.  Presumably a small number; I
would estimate no more than two or three dozen."
</p>

<p>
I looked at him with renewed respect.  When you listened to Isaac's
windbaggery, it was easy to forget just how brilliant the man was.
"Why just a couple dozen?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Because more would be counter to their goals," Reynard supplied,
nodding as he followed Isaac's thoughts.  "Their purpose here was to
pump as many secrets into the ritual as possible in order to gain
control over Herr&uacute;n. They would have kept back a few of their
members as outriders&mdash;sentries, a reserve force, something like
that&mdash;but the vast majority would have gone after the primary
mission and therefore been in the canyon.  Put simply: any Ice
Assassin that <em>wasn't</em> sacrificing was not contributing to the
mission, so they would have held back the smallest number possible."
</p>

<p>
"That's reassuring," I responded.  "But won't they all just regenerate
back at their phylacteries?"
</p>

<p>
Unn shook her head.  "No.  When he originally described the spell to
me, Lord Loki said that an Ice Assassin is a 'soulless being.'  A
phylactery is a container for a lich's soul; the Ice Assassins can't
have one, only the original.  The ones we killed truly <em>are</em>
dead.  They can't even be resurrected, because there's nothing to
recall from the afterlife."
</p>

<p>
I gave a fistpump.  "Woot!  Go Team Us!  Now we just need to do that a
few more times and we're good."
</p>

<p>
Thomas was looking somber.  "Loki said that 'Lichboy' is eleven
thousand years old.  Presumably he's an Archmage and has maximized his
intelligence, meaning that he has at least five ninth level spell
slots per day, just from his wizard class.  In theory, he could have
created five Ice Assassins every day for eleven millenia.  And the Ice
Assassins could have created more of themselves&mdash;there's no
telling how many we could be facing."
</p>

<p>
Unn shook her head.  "No, it's not that bad.  Simulacrum requires the
caster to sacrifice experience points; presumably Ice Assassin does as
well.  The Ice Assassins are not capable of gaining experience points,
so they can't create more of themselves.  And 'Lichboy' probably
wouldn't want to burn up too many of his own experience points.
According to what the Ice Assassin told us he had retired and was
spending most of his time on research instead of adventuring.  At his
level, it's very hard to find combats that will grant much experience
without attracting the attention of divine or semi-divine beings, so
sacrificing too much experience wouldn't be in his interest."
</p>

<p>
This situation was starting to look hopeful.  Also, I could feel a
nasty smile spreading across my face as I saw the obvious exploit.  It
would take a while, though, and there was one that I wanted to get to
first.
</p>

<p>
"Thomas, go send some people out," I told him.  "Doesn't have to be
Landguard, just needs to be a lot of people.  I want as many worms as
they can find.  I'm talking thousands at least."  
</p>

<p>
Thomas frowned.  "We're in rocky terrain, Your Majesty.  There aren't
likely to be many worms in the area.  What do you need them for?"
</p>

<p>
I snickered.  "I'd rather not say&mdash;OPSEC, you know.  There could
be eyes on us right now."  I made an exaggerated point of looking
around for spies.
</p>

<p>
He gave me a gimlet stare but harumphed and sent off a Sending.
</p>

<p>
"M'Lord," Suze put in diffidently.  "Worms can survive being cut in
two if they're large enough.  If you can find a few, you can double
the number by splitting them.  Then a little bit of healing magic will
put each one back to full strength and size, so you can split them
again."
</p>

<p>
We all blinked and stopped walking, turning to stare at her.  She
blushed at the attention, but kept her spine straight instead of
shrinking back like she used to.
</p>

<p>
"Suze, that's brilliant.  How did you think of that?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
She blushed harder.  "Derry&mdash;the footman back at the
castle?&mdash;he grew up in Rockport, M'Lord.  He and his father were
poor; they got a lot of food by hunting and fishing, but there wasn't
much bait to be had.  His father had been a novice at a healing temple
so he had a few orisons that he could use to heal the worms."
</p>

<p>
I laughed.  "Score one for street smarts over ivory tower
booklearning.  Yeah, Thomas, do that.  The Landguard's Lay On Hands
ability is tailor-made for the job."  Thomas seemed vaguely offended
at the idea of his people using their divinely-provided
intended-for-protecting-the-ruler healing powers on squirmy
invertebrates but, meh.  He sent the Sending, and that's all I cared
about.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, sounds like we've got us a plan," I said, smiling.  I started
pacing down the corridor again as I laid out the specifics; everyone
else swung into motion around me. "Kill off all the minor undead we
can find in order to decrease Deadboy's power, make it easier for the
Team Life gods to stomp him into the ground.  Albrecht, I'll provide
tactics, you set strategy and choose targets.  Fair enough?"  My
Strategos gave a sharp nod, pleased at being included.
</p>

<p>
My smile kept getting nastier.  "Ok, you work on that.  In the
meantime, I've got a trick to show you."
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
The sun was just touching the horizon; the shadows stretched across
the rocky, red-brown clay around us like giant fingers.  The canyon
below us was entirely wreathed in shadows; the only light came from
the fires on the altars and a faint haze of multi-colored sparkles
that connected the altars together in a miniature Milky Way.
</p>

<p>
In front of us were a pair of forty foot high Walls of Iron.  They
stood parallel to one another, about a hundred feet apart, and were
firmly rooted in the rock at the lip of the canyon.  Immediately
beside the eastern one stood a roofed-over scaffold made of ten foot
ladders and quarterstaves, all held together with Sovereign Glue.
Another platform, much larger, ran between the two Walls, just outside
the box they defined.  Waiting at the top were fifty magi, my war
council, and a half dozen Landguard to keep an eye on everything.
</p>

<p>
Beside me, a mage named Sigurd had just finished casting a third Wall
of Iron, this one freestanding.  Alpha Squad immediately put their
backs to it and pushed until it toppled over.
</p>

<p>
It hit the ground with a titanic <em>WHAM!</em> and a blast of dust
that left all of us choking and rubbing our eyes.  As soon as I could
see again, I stepped up to the Wall&mdash;now really more of a
Floor&mdash;and tapped it with the Rule of Size.
</p>

<p>
"Reducio," I instructed it.  "Command words: Shrinken, Embiggen,
GoCloth, GoIron."  The thing obediently shrank to a tiny swatch of
iron foil.  Carefully, I poured a single drop of Sovereign Glue on the
very edge of it and pressed the end of a ten foot pole into the glue.
(Apparently, ten foot poles really <em>were</em> useful for more than
breaking the monetary system.  Go figure.)
</p>

<p>
Speaking of useful, Sovereign Glue is amazingly useful stuff: it forms
an absolutely, utterly, indisputably unbreakable bond between any
two substances.  It can only be dissolved using a special
general-purpose solvent (named, appropriately enough, Universal
Solvent).  Both the Glue and the Solvent are hellishly tricky to work
with.  If you get some Superglue on your fingers and you don't have
any acetone handy, you have to pry your fingers apart very carefully
in order to avoid losing skin.  If you get some Sovereign Glue on your
fingers and you don't have any Universal Solvent handy, you have to
cut your fingers off to get them apart.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Gr&#491;fhamr had literally thousands of
gallons of the stuff, and of the solvent.  Apparently, it was used
heavily in construction and industry, and had been recovered when the
Deorsi raided the warehouse where they got the Portable Holes.
</p>

<p>
"Go set that up, would you?" I asked, handing the pole-and-foil combo
to Franklin.  "Don't forget to scatter a bunch of the worms on it."
</p>

<p>
He nodded, face carefully and professionally blank insted of giving me
the confused scowl he no doubt wanted to.  Carefully taking the weird
foil-and-pole conglomerate from me, he trotted over to the eastern
Wall of Iron and mounted the neighboring scaffold.
</p>

<p>
I turned to the final member of our little party.  "Kaelan, you set?"
I asked.
</p>

<p>
Kaelan couldn't have been more than nineteen&mdash;an infant by Deorsi
standards&mdash;and had just graduated from her apprenticeship, having
become a first-level wizard only yesterday.  She was clearly very
confused about why she was getting such personal attention from such
luminaries as Unn (and, presumably "whoever this wacko is that Unn is
letting hang around with her" as I'm sure she thought of me).  Also,
she was clearly about as comfortable as a sheep on roller skates with
said attention.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Your Majesty?" she said, sounding more like it was a question.
"I just have to say the word?"
</p>

<p>
I nodded and flapped my hands at her in a shooing motion, giving her a
big smile at the same time.  "Yep.  Off you go."  She started to trot
off and I called after her.  "Make sure you've got your spellbook and
pens ready!  You'll need them!"  She glanced back, gave me an
uncertain wave, and pulled herself up the scaffold to stand beside
Franklin.
</p>

<p>
"Embiggen," the young Landguard said, holding the pole-and-foil out in
front of him.  Instantly, the foil turned back into a horizontal mass
of iron, spanning across the other two Walls to form something like a
metallic Stonehenge.  Well, if Stonehenge were only one dolmen,
anyway.
</p>

<p>
He looked ridiculous, standing there holding onto one end of a pole
that was suddenly attached to several tens of thousands of pounds of
metal.  I could tell from his slightly hunched stance that
he <em>felt</em> ridiculous, too.  Especially when he let go of the
pole to pick up one of the buckets of dirt and worms from beside him
and toss it across the iron platform.  Immediately, he set the bucket
down and took up his grip on the pole again.
</p>

<p>
I smiled wickedly and scampered up the scaffold behind me to join all
the magi.  Thomas and Alpha Squad climbed up behind me, moving more
sedately than my manic-energied self.
</p>

<p>
"Ladies and gentlemen!" I called, forcing myself not to say "...and
children of all ages!"  This was, after all, a bit of a circus that I
was about to enact.  "Welcome to the first test of the Flobovian Level
Enhancement Apparatus!  FLEA is intended to help every one of you be
all that you can be!  See those worms?  In just a moment, I'm going to
ask you lot"&mdash;I waved at the more experienced magi, implicitly
excluding the group of first-levelers standing to one side&mdash;"to
Polymorph those worms into fire giants.  Everyone ready?"  A
sussurance of puzzled but willing 'yes'es rolled through the crowd.  I
called across to Franklin and Kaelan and got another set of 'yes'es.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, on three.  One, two, <em>three!</em>" I called, dropping my hand
in a starting signal.
</p>

<p>
"Polymorph Any Object: Worm to Fire Giant!" they all cried, pointing
at the worms.  The iron platform across from us was suddenly crowded
with thirty-four very confused Fire Giants.
</p>

<p>
The giants looked around, trying to figure out what was happening.
Seeing us, one of them roared and started to shift his weight, only to
be interrupted by a trembling teenage voice calling, "Shrinken!"
</p>

<p>
The tipped-over Wall of Iron that the Fire Giants were standing on was
suddenly yanked out from under their feet, becoming a tiny piece of
iron foil attached to a pole, well off to the side.  The pole held the
foil securely so that it didn't fall once it was unsupported.  Sadly,
the Giants had no such support themselves now that they were hanging
in midair, again with great confusion.  They didn't have long to be
confused; before any of them could react, they plummeted
groundwards...
</p>

<p>
...right onto the Permanencied Wall of Force that had been carefully
bent back and forth between the two Walls of Iron, forming a series of
infinitely sharp, utterly invisible pleats onto which the Fire Giants
fell.
</p>

<p>
The (pardon me) giant creatures were chopped into sashimi, instantly
reverting to normal sized earthworms.
</p>

<p>
"Ohmygod!" Kaelan gasped.  "I...I know ninth level spells!"
</p>

<p>
"Next!" I yelled, waving the next apprentice mage over to take his
place next to Franklin, who was busy embiggening the Wall of Iron to
once again span the gap.  Kaelan picked up another bucket of dirt and
worms and hurled it across the iron, then immediately dropped down
cross-legged on the platform and flipped open her spellbook.  She
seemed a bit lost to the world, and I couldn't blame her.  It wasn't
every day that you wake up as a first level Graduate mage with three
spells and go to bed as a a twenty-seventh level Master High Mage with
fifty-five.  Wizards got two free spells every time they went up a
level; by jacking her straight to level twenty-seven, we could
suddenly add over fifty new spells to her repertoire...from which, of
course, they could then be distributed into the spell books of
every <em>other</em> wizard in the city.
</p>

<p>
Best of all, we had told her in advance what new spells to choose.  We
now had a woman who could cast Mage's Magnificent Mansion (to help
with the overcrowding and craptastic food), Polymorph Any Object (to
help run the FLEA for other people), Wish (for basically
everything)...and also Ice Assassin and Mindscrape.
</p>

<p>
See, that's the most ridiculous part of leveling up when you're a
mage: for each level, you can have any two spells you want.  Doesn't
matter if you know anything about the spells.  Doesn't matter if
there's no conceivable way on god's green earth that you could
possibly know anything about those spells.  If you know they exist,
you can have them spontaneously appear in your spellbook when you go
up a level.  
</p>

<p>
I was feeling pretty smugly pleased with myself.  I smiled happily,
gripping the lapels of my trenchcoat and rocking on my heels.  "That
felt really good," I commented to Thomas.  I waved towards
Kaelan. "Look how happy she is.  And being able to do this for her and
everyone else is going to make a big difference.  As messed up as I
was this morning, I don't think I would have thought of this.  I hate
to say it, but Icefi really did me a favor when he Mindscraped all
that crap out of my head."
</p>

<p>
Reynard had been wearing a fond smile while he watched Kaelan
scribbling and the next young Graduate&mdash;a young man named
Obrecht&mdash;plonking down beside her to frantically scribble down
his own new spells now that he too had become a Master High Mage.
When he heard my idle comment, he stopped and grabbed my arm.  I
turned to find him staring at me, eyes wide.
</p>

<p>
"Did you say 'Mindscrape', My Lord?" Reynard asked, the whites showing
all the way around his eyes.
</p>

<p>
I frowned.  "Yeees?  Why?" I had a very bad feeling that I wasn't
going to like the answer.
</p>

<p>
"My Lord&mdash;Your Majesty...I know that spell.  It's a vile, dark
spell, outlawed in Flobovia for two hundred years.  Programmed Amnesia
is intended as a medical spell&mdash;it gives the
caster <em>access</em> to your memories.  Mindscrape is a battle
spell; the caster of Mindscrape <em>learns everything the target
knows.</em>  Everything."  I could almost see the blood draining out
of his face as he said it.
</p>

<p>
I thought about that for a minute.  And then another.  The longer I
thought about it, the more scared I became.
</p>

<p>
"Everything I know?" I asked in a small voice.  "Physics, chemistry,
military history, the rules of the D&D game that this place runs
on...?"
</p>

<p>
He nodded, his face getting paler by the moment.  "Everything," he
replied.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps this isn't the ideal location to discuss this...?" Thomas
commented quietly, waving a hand vaguely in a gesture that clearly
meant 'because a god could be scrying on us right the frack now you
idiot and the whole idea is to keep it quiet that we're working with
Icefi.'
</p>

<p>
Hey, it was a very expressive gesture.
</p>

<p>
It took me a second, but I shook off the shocked paralysis and started
climbing down the scaffolding.  "You guys keep going with the boosts,"
I called to the magi.  "When you run out of Polymorph Any Object
spells, get some other magi in here who can cast it."  They responded
in the affirmative, but my thoughts were already elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
As I paced back towards Gr&#491;fhamr, I kept thinking more and more
about the implications.  And the more I thought about it, the angrier
I got.
</p>

<p>
By the time we got back into the city, I was seething.  "Thinks he can
steal all my stuff, huh?" I hissed.  "Oh, that is <em>so</em> not on."
</p>

<p>
"What are you thinking, Your Majesty?" Thomas asked carefully.
</p>

<p>
I snarled.  "Lichboy and his Invisible Sky Daddy want to play games?
We can do that.  Game <em>on</em>, baby.  Game on."
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
Several miles in the air, a wizard popped into existence.  Supported
by her Fly spell, Febe glanced down to verify that she was in the
correct place; she was reassured to see the giant seething mass of
undead a mile below (which, under normal circumstances, would be a
thing to be most <em>un</em>reassured by).  Satisfied, she unslung her
backpack and turned it upside down.  The backpack clearly had no truck
with physics, because several tens of thousands of tiny clay blobs
poured out and began to plummet towards the earth a mile below.
</p>

<p>
Febe let herself have a moment to watch the blobs fall.  They were
simple things&mdash;fragments of the 'clusterbomb' ammunition that
this strange new lord had introduced, baked into a fresh layer of
clay.  She had seen the tests; when the things hit hard ground they
shattered, releasing the Celestial Brilliance'd rubber balls inside.
The results would be devatating to an undead army.
</p>

<p>
Regretfully, she shook herself out of the woolgathering and teleported
back to Gr&#491;fhamr for another load.  She and her compatriots had a
lot more deliveries to make tonight, both to Afi's Legions and to the
forces of the other liches.
</p>

<p>
Her teeth were bared in a vicious smile as she appeared in the air
over Gr&#491;fhamr.  <em>~It's about time they started letting us take
the fight back to the enemy,~</em> she thought.
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
"Tamar, God of Smiths, God of Dwarves, God of Stone and Steel, reveal
yourself to us!" the cleric called.  She grabbed her beard in one hand
and sliced off a few hairs with the razor sharp mithral dagger that
was her most prized possession.  The hairs went into the brazier, her
sacrifice to draw the attention of her god.
</p>

<p>
It took a few minutes, but eventually a metallic haze floated up from
the brazier and gathered, slowly, into the semblance of a face.  It
was wider and sharper than a human's, with rugged lines that seemed to
have been chiseled from mountain granite.
</p>

<p>
<strong>"Why do you call, My Priestess?"</strong>  The voice sounded
like the two sides of a faultline grinding against one another.
</p>

<p>
Katash&mdash;it was only the first two syllables of her proper name,
but her proper name went on for a year and a day and was just too
impractical for normal use so, 'Katash' it was. Katash struck her
chest with one fist in salute to her god.  "Steellord, I have an
outsider here who beseeches a boon."
</p>

<p>
One of the craggy eyebrows lifted. <strong>"A boon, for an outsider?
And a human at that?  A bold request.  What boon would you ask, little
human?"</strong>
</p>

<p>
The tone of that voice was pretty much the same as one might use to
say "Oh look, a cockroach.  Eww."  I found this fact...disconcerting.
</p>

<p>
"Steellord, I seek knowledge, and I wish to trade starmetal for it.
Will you hear my request?"  I was on my knees in proper penitent
fashion and speaking using the polite forms I'd been drilled in.  It
grated like a wire brush on the foreskin of my antitheistic soul, but
I was doing it.
</p>

<p>
<em>~Hm.  That analogy started off well and then turned rather
horrifying,~</em> I thought, then shook the idea aside.  When one's
internal narration started critiquing itself, it was definitely time
to start looking for a therapist.  Besides, it was important to stay
focused right now.  Eyes on the prize, baby, eyes on the prize.
</p>

<p>
<strong>"Clever, human,"</strong> the Voice rumbled, somewhere between
amused and irked. <strong>"You know how much we prize starmetal.  Very
well, make your request."</strong>
</p>

<p>
"There are several drow cities below the Gray Spine mountains,
Steellord.  They make weapons and armor which they trade to our
enemies, the drauga.  For each city whose location you are willing to
provide, I will trade you one hundred million tons of starmetal."
</p>

<p>
The face of the God recoiled in shock.  "A hundred million tons?!
There isn't such an amount!"
</p>

<p>
Good; not only were the reverb and boom gone from his voice, he was
incredulous instead of angry.  I could work with that.
</p>

<p>
"Steellord, it's true.  I realize that the amount of iron that has
come to earth from the heavens is far, far less than what I mention,
but I happen to know of a source.  Now, unfortunately, bringing it
down to earth may dig up the ground a bit, so I'd need to know that
was okay with you...."
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
Cataclysms came to life and walked down the Gray Spines; wreathed in
plasma and striking with the metaphorical power of a god's fist, the
artificially created meteors hammered into the ground one after
another.  Impact after impact dug the craters deeper and deeper,
smashing down and down and down until they smashed through the
protective armor of the rock like the largest bunker busters ever
invented, blasting into the caverns of the drow and erasing them
instantly from existence.
</p>

<p>
"I assume you have fully grasped my master's intent?" the vampire
demanded of the Spider Priestess, dismissing his scrying with a casual
wave now that what he had wanted to show her was done.  "He has grown
tired of the way your people gouge prices.  There will be no more
commerce.  From now on, you will offer tribute of armor and weapons
for two hundred and fifty thousand undead warriors per month.  For
every day that you are late, another city will be destroyed."
</p>

<p>
The drow priestess seethed but kept the rage off her beautiful face.
"Of course, High One.  Lord Afi shall receive the first tribute within
thirty days, you have my word.  I thank you for conveying the
message."  She gave a perfectly respectful bow, deep enough that her
face was hidden; she wasn't sure how much longer she could keep
smiling at this arrogant <em>thing</em>, but she didn't dare let him
see her rage.
</p>

<p>
At least, not until she'd had time to gather the families for war.
</p>

<p>
Colborn sniffed derisively and teleported away without another word.
He had two more drow cities and a svartalfen mage academy to make
stops at.  After all, it was important that they be apprised of "Afi's
demands" in time to prepare.
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
<em>*Hey Bonebrain!*</em> I sent through the link, directing it to
everyone so that we could all follow the conversation.
</p>

<p>
<em>*What do you want, human?*</em> the dry, slithery voice demanded.
</p>

<p>
<em>*Got a deal for you,*</em> I told him, my mental voice filled with
savage glee.  <em>*We left a helmet at the downhill end of the canyon.
You put it on and let it do its thing, or we fire off a Sending to Afi
telling him about you.*</em>
</p>

<p>
The response was dry as bone, but I could "hear" hints of anger behind
it. <em>*Try it, human, and I'll exterminate your pathetic little
colony.*</em> The voice took on a note of mocking humor.  <em>*I must
say, you 'Flobovians' make up for your stupid name with your sheer
ingenuity at destruction. This Bag of Holding I'm looking at is
lovely.*</em>
</p>

<p>
I winced a little at that and flashed Albrecht an apologetic look.  He
rolled his eyes.
</p>

<p>
<em>*Sure, you could do that,*</em> I told him.  <em>*Of course, it
wouldn't help your cause&mdash;I've sent dozens of magi out already.
Unless they get a recall order, in five minutes they'll start sending
messages to Afi, the other Lich Kings, and anyone in general that we
think might be in contact with Afi.  They won't stop sending them,
either; eventually, one of those messages is going to show up when
Neklos is paying attention, and then the game's over.  Neklos will
know that Afi is trying to betray him, will know that you exist...my
guess is he'll rip Afi's mind apart then and there and just use his
body as a finger puppet from then on.  Do you want to find out?*</em>
</p>

<p>
There was a brief pause; when the voice returned, there was an entire
arctic wasteland behind it and it was directed at Thomas, not at
me.  <em>*God-slave, you will make him send that recall order
immediately, or my brothers and I will begin glassing your nation.  I
have done my research, meatling.  I know where your parents live, and
your sister.  Quite a sweet little thing, and such pretty red hair.
It would be a shame if I had to burn it off one strand at a time with
Acid Spray.*</em>
</p>

<p>
Thomas laughed across the link.  <em>*You really don't understand the
Landguard at all, do you, soulless one?  We
do <strong>whatever</strong> is necessary.  I sliced your brother into
rags even though he was my dearest friend.*</em> Thomas's voice took
on a pretended faraway tone, layered over not-so-secret malicious
pleasure.  <em>*I was surprised to find that liches can still feel
pain, you know.  It made it so much more fun, knowing that it hurt him
when I shattered his legbones and dropped him in a mewling heap at my
feet.  He tried to curse me about then...wasn't very successful, since
I'd already spitted his skull on my blade.  Rather interfered with him
working his jaw, you know?*</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>*You will not allow your Land to come to harm,*</em> the Ice
Assassin responded, absolute certainty in its mental voice.  <em>*I am
above your parents' house as we speak.  Make your little puppet king
send the order, or I will burn it to the ground with your family
inside.*</em>
</p>

<p>
Thomas's face smoothed out, becoming a blank mask.  <em>*Go ahead.
Unless we can stop your master they would die anyway.  You stole
knowledge that we need kept secret.  Change alignment so we can trust
you, or I will see you and your creator destroyed, even if the world
burns for it and my family is first in the fire.*</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>*Just for the record?*</em> I told the Ice Assassin
gleefully.  <em>*I <strong>can't</strong> send the recall order.  Only
Thomas can do that...and I think you now have a sense of how likely
you are to persuade him before time runs out.*</em>
</p>

<p>
The pause was substantial this time, and we all held our breath.  This
was a very, very high stakes game of chicken, and all we could do was
pray the Ice Assassin didn't call our bluff...mostly because it wasn't
a bluff.  We really had precommitted exactly the way we claimed.
Nothing else would have sufficed against an enemy like this.  And I
really <em>couldn't</em> issue the recall order.  I had deliberately
left that authority to Thomas and only Thomas.
</p>

<p>
<em>*Suppose I was willing to do this thing, to yield to your
demands,*</em> the dry voice said.  "<em>*How do I know I can trust you,
meatling?  How do I know that you wouldn't begin sending these
messages anyway?*</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>*Allow your alignment to be changed and I will recall the magi.
Allow your alignment to be changed and I will prevent these messages
from being sent in future, so long as you and all of yours maintain
faith with us and do not cast yourselves against us.  I swear on the
Land, and in the name of the True God of Flobovia, to keep my faith
with thee,*</em> Thomas sent soberly.  There was a formality to the
thoughts, a hint of recitation from long-treasured source.  <em>*I
bind my honor and my soul in earnest to this vow: my word is good, my
intent is without deceit, I shall not waver from its
completion.* </em>
</p>

<p>
Again the pause dragged on, but this time it felt more like shocked
surprise.
</p>

<p>
<em>*I believe you, paladin,*</em> the slithery voice of the Ice
Assassin replied in a tone of surprised respect.  <em>*But I cannot
accept your bargain.  Becoming Good might place me in opposition to my
master.  I cannot allow that.  What I can do, however, is to sacrifice
the knowledge that I took from your Emperor, and give my oath that no
other has it.  Will that suffice?*</em>
</p>

<p>
I nodded in excitement, forgetting that he couldn't see me.  <em>*Yes!
That will do fine.  We'll meet you&mdash;*</em>
</p>

<p>
Thomas's hand on my arm disrupted my thought-sending.  <em>*No.  That
will not suffice.  You will wear the helmet and accept the change or
the messages will be sent, even if the world burns for it.*</em>
</p>

<p>
My eyes were wide and I could feel the blood draining right out of my
face.  "Thomas, what are you doing?!" I hissed.  "Take the deal!  All
we need is to make sure he doesn't have the info, don't go nuclear if
you don't have to!"
</p>

<p>
Thomas shook his head, face set.  <em>*You will accept the change or
the world burns, monster.  Make your choice.*
</p>

<em><strong>Author's Commentary:</strong> Jake's promise of 'one
hundred million tons' of starmetal (a.k.a.  iron that fell from the
sky) was a gross understatement; he just didn't think that Tamar would
believe the truth.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>The 'bunker busters' they used were 100-meter diameter solid iron
kinetic bolides, created using Polymorph Any Object.  (They could have
used shaped osmium harpoons, which would have done more damage, but
this was just as easy and made Tamar happier.)  Each of the bolides
massed over four billion tons each, and our Big Damn Heroes weren't
interested in bringing ammo home; they dropped a few dozen on each
drow city.  After all, that's what's necessary to dig through a mile
of solid rock.</em>

</p>

<p>
<em>I intend to keep 2YE itself free, and I have no intention of

</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>The blurb for "One Hot Night" is:</em>
</p>
<p>
"In a society without death, Ingfred is 20 years old and has no
prospects. All the good jobs are filled by undying masters of their
craft, and it's hard to be taken seriously when you are, compared to
everyone around you, an infant.  Fortunately, he has a solution:
undergo an illegal transformation and sell the memory to The
Experiental Herald for a ridiculous sum.
</p>

<p>
There's two problems: how can Ingfred convince a powerful wizard to
risk his mage license and his freedom to help with such a crazy plan?
And, once that's done...how will Ingfred deal with the law?"
</p>
