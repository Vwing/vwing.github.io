<em><strong>Author's Note</strong>:  Still don't own D&D.</em>
</p>

<hr />

<p>
I gathered my courage up in both hands, bracing myself for the most
horrific moment of my entire time in Flobovia.  Looking around, I
assessed the threats.  It was bad. I was surrounded by enemies and
none of the Landguard could save me; I would have to get myself out of
this one.
</p>

<p>
I took a deep breath and climbed to my feet, working hard to control
my body language and expression so as not to show weakness; I was sure
they'd be able to smell it on me.  If they did, they'd pull me down in
a heartbeat.
</p>

<p>
"Before anything else happens here," I said, and paused to sweep my
gaze over my opponents.  "Before anything else, I must apologize to
you, Your Benevolence."
</p>

<p>
Eyebrows went up around the table and not a few heads were cocked, but
noone said anything.
</p>

<p>
In for a penny, in for the entire mint.  "After the parley with the
Deorsi, I allowed my temper to get away from me.  I said things that
were not true, things I did not mean,"&mdash;now <em>that</em> was a
lie; every word had been perfectly true and I had meant every one of
them&mdash;"and it was wrong of me to do so.  Especially since, as I
only recently found out, you literally moved heaven and earth to bring
me back to life after I was killed in the Deorsi attack.  It was
ungracious and unwise of me,"&mdash;that part was true enough; I
really shouldn't have said things that would make an enemy of the most
powerful religious leader in the country&mdash;"and I would like to
make amends."
</p>

<p>
I turned to Suze, seated in the chair behind me, and took a small,
leather-bound volume from her hands.  "I was told that you once went
to an estate sale in search of a copy of Rupert Selig's <em>De
Daemonibus</em>," I told him, hefting the book thoughtfully in both
hands. "I never heard if you actually obtained it.  This is a first
copy of <em>De Daemonibus,</em> penned by Selig himself and signed to
you by the author."  I reached across the narrow table, offering it
with both hands.  Looking both surprised and wary, the Archpriest took
it from me.  "The original is yours to keep, of course.  With your
permission, a copy will be made to be the first book in the Archpriest
Michael Commemorative Library, which will be endowed by the throne and
will begin life with a collection of ten thousand books&mdash;I hope
you will help us select what should be on the list?"  I paused and
looked at him inquiringly until I got a nod back.

<p>
Good, that nod was half the battle for turning him into a supporter: I
had gotten him to recognize and acknowledge an unsolicited gift,
thereby creating a sense of indebtedness on his part. More
importantly, I had gotten him personally involved in it.  I would be
part of the process as well, but would allow him the preeminent role.
If I played my cards carefully, I could completely reverse his current
negative opinion of me&mdash;working together would give us something
to bond over and, by letting him be the big boss and mostly supporting
his decisions, I could leave him with the impression that I was smart
and likable. (Because, after all, who doesn't think that someone who
agrees with them is smart and likable?)  I would need to occasionally
challenge him, respectfully, so that he didn't think I was a doormat,
but that was manageable.
</p>

<p>
<em>~Psychology, ta ma duh: Do you speak it?!~</em> I cackled silently
to myself, taking just one moment to feel smug.  And, also, to wonder
why I suddenly had a vision of Caucasian cowboys speaking Mandarin to
each other in front of a spaceship?
</p>

<p>
Meh, who knew?  My brain was a very weird place even before the
Archmagi had done their redecorating, and I had a feeling they hadn't
made things any better; I just hoped they hadn't made them too much
worse.  Still, it was good to know that the memories weren't gone,
just suppressed...well, assuming that was a memory.  It seemed more
like a dream of something that might have been as opposed to an actual
personal memory.
</p>

<p>
Shaking off the mental tangent, I went back to my campaign of
Archpriest-buttering-up.  "There's already a team scouting for a
location for the library," I announced. "If you don't object, they'll
be checking in with you in a few days to review possible sites.  The
Sultanic Architect is drawing up plans now and will be by to review
them with you as soon as they're ready."
</p>

<p>
"I see," he said, frowning.  My stomach sank like a stone; from his
expression, I had a feeling that my offer hadn't gone down as well as
I'd expected.  And I would have to wait until we weren't in front of
all the other Conclave members before telling him that his nephew was
being allowed into Landguard.  That had to stay secret or Thomas would
barbecue me for dinner.
</p>

<p>
"Finally," I announced, trying hard not to sigh.  This was going to be
an expensive way to make amends, but I really couldn't afford for this
man to have a vendetta against me.  "I would like to offer you this."
Reaching into my pocket, I clicked one of the rubies out of my
fully-stocked Ring of Three Wishes.  I proffered it across the table
between thumb and forefinger, carefully keeping my other fingers out
of the way so everyone could see the stone.  A slight twist of the
wrist caused the late afternoon sunlight to gleam off the stone's
facets, making it seem to glow from within.
</p>

<p>
"This ruby is a spell in physical form.  Crush it between your fingers
and it will grant your wish&mdash;literally.  Its power isn't
infinite, but it's very large.  It can duplicate any arcane spell of
8th level or lower, or any spell at all of 6th level or lower.  It can
transport large groups from anywhere to anywhere, even across planes.
It can rewind time one round in order to undo something that just
happened.  It can even create magic items."  I smiled ruefully and
rubbed my neck in obvious embarrassment.  "Although I would suggest
you not try to create any magic items that grant Wishes.  Apparently
the gods disapprove. Strenuously."  I put a hand on my back and
stretched it a little with an exaggerated wince.  Michael's lip
twitched in an almost-smile and he unbent a little further.
</p>

<p>
I had put a lot of thought into whether or not I should admit the part
about Ilara smacking me because I Wished for Wishes.  On the one hand,
Greed was whispering that I should keep the 'infinite Wishes' loop to
myself, just in case I could figure out a way to make it work without
that whole "shredding his immortal soul" thing.  On the other hand,
Forethought told me that maybe I should ensure noone else tried the
trick, because if they did Ilara might just decide to kill me along
with the poor guy making the Wish, just to tie up earlier business.
(No, it didn't seem terribly logical to me but, then again, I don't
even understand <em>human</em> women, much less divine ones.)
</p>

<p>
I set the ruby gently in the Archpriest's outstretched hand, working
hard to conceal my distaste at giving it up. (Especially to this man!)
"Remember, its powers aren't infinite.  Suffice it to say that it's
powerful and can probably do whatever you want done, but there might
be some exceptions.  The ruby can't be harmed unless you deliberately
crush it between your fingers, so don't worry about it getting damaged
if you keep it in the same pocket as your keys.  Just don't let
yourself get pickpocketed."  I flashed him a grin and a wink, and he
actually smiled back&mdash;a very small and tightlipped smile, but a
smile nonetheless.  Progress!
</p>

<p>
I didn't let my feeling of satisfaction show, though.  "Moving on," I
told them, taking my seat and happily shifting away from the
incredibly uncomfortable task of apologizing to the Archpriest.
"We've managed to hammer out something that looks a lot like a peace
treaty, or even a 'favored trading partner' agreement with the Deorsi.
All we need to do is not muck it up, and a primary piece of 'don't
muck it up' involves me going to Anundj&aring; sometime in the next
few days.  I'll be taking Thomas and some of the Landguard with me
when I go, so Thomas will choose a proxy to sit on the Conclave.  This
person will be selected by tonight and will serve as proxy for both
Thomas and myself.  They will, of course, be in close contact through
scrying and Message spells, so you can feel confident that their votes
reflect our actual views, and that we will back that up when we return
in a week or two."  In practice, it was probably going to be more than
'a week or two' until I came back and, unless things went very wrong,
the Landguard wouldn't be coming back at all.  Regardless, the
Conclave didn't need to know that right now.
</p>

<p>
After a quick pause to survey everyone's reaction to the news, I
concluded the speech. "In the meantime, since there is no longer a
major military threat, we will be dispatching the majority of the
Landguard back to the provinces to resume their normal duties."
</p>

<p>
Lady Justice frowned at that.  "Are you sure it wouldn't be wiser to
bring all of them with you, My Lord?  My Justiciars can handle the
policing issues in the countryside without help, and the special
squads can deal with any monster slaying.  Surely the best use of the
Landguard would be preventing harm from coming to our leader?"
</p>

<p>
I was pretty sure that her whole speech could be translated as "hey, I
don't want these guys to go back to intefering with how I run the
legal system, I'd much rather they continue heading for the city to
provide bodyguard services."  This wasn't a topic I wanted to pursue,
since the idea that we were sending all the Landguard back to the
countryside was another outright lie; it wasn't going to be
anything <em>like</em> a majority of the Landguard.
</p>

<p>
Thomas had suggested that it would be a bad idea for anyone to know
that <em>all</em> of the Landguard were going out of the country, and
I agreed with his assessment.  After some discussion, we had decided
to play a shell game; we would leave about fifty Landguard in the
capital to show a significant presence, and send a couple dozen out
into the countryside.  The ones in the country would be moving around
as fast as possible, making appearances over as wide an area as
possible so as to give the impression that there were more of them
than there were.  From what Thomas implied, the Landguard could
move <em>fast</em> when they wanted to, so the idea wasn't as crazy as
it seemed.  They could use different names in different places and, as
long as no one started counting faces, we were golden.  Even the faces
weren't a total show-stopper; some of the Landguard had at least
enough magic ability to use spells like Alter Self and Disguise Self,
so they could literally look and sound like a different person in
every town.  For a little while, at least, those two dozen Landguard
could give the impression of being hundreds...as long as they didn't
mind missing a lot of sleep in order to travel.
</p>

<p>
I smiled pleasantly at Lady Justice.  "Thank you very much for your
concern, Lady.  I promise I'll be safe; Commander Thomas has
hand-picked the men and women who will be guarding me, and we're both
confident that I'll be safe."
</p>

<p>
Which was...Jedi true, again.  Thomas <em>had</em> hand-picked my
protectors.  It's just that his criteria were "if it's a Landguard, it
goes."  The whole point of leaving behind what were effectively a
skeleton crew of decoys was so that Thomas could bring nearly eighteen
hundred Landguard with us to Anundj&aring; without anyone in Flobovia
being aware that they were gone.  Given that we were headed into an
incredibly dangerous warzone, I thought that bringing the whole 'Guard
was a fantastic idea: it would make it so much easier to arrange
plausibly accidental deaths for all of them.
</p>

<p>
"And what exactly do you expect us to be doing while you're off
hobnobbing with our enemies...excuse me, with our <em>former</em>
enemies?"  Lady Justice inquired archly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, first of all, we need to mobilize the nation.  If any of what
Albrecht has told us is true, then in the not too distant future we're
going to be facing an absolutely enormous army of undead who increase
their numbers very quickly.  We're going to need the largest military
possible, as quickly as possible.  That will require mage and cleric
support and, equally importantly, it will require military police to
keep order.  Lord Mage, Lord Priest," I said, shifting my gaze to the
Archmage and Archpriest (why did they have both 'Arch-' and 'Lord' as
titles?  Couldn't they just be efficient and pick one?).  "The two of
you will coordinate the first two groups.  Lady Justice, you will be
responsible for recruitment, training, and management of the military
police.  These are all critical roles; without discipline, the army
will melt away or turn to looting.  Without cleric support, the army
will die of simple wounds and disease.  Without mage support the army
will simply die in combat.  As strong as our soldiers are, we can't
match the number of undead we're going to see if we stick with
straight melee."
</p>

<p>
"That said, we are going to desperately need melee troops.  Archers
won't help much against undead, so we'll need steel to keep the enemy
off the magi and consolidate ground when we capture it.  Duke
Frederick," I nodded to the man who had originally held me in
contempt, then in rage and grudging respect, and now was most likely
planning to stick a knife in my back at the first opportunity.  "For
the duration of the war, you'll be in charge of recruitment and
training for the troops.  While Thomas and I are away in Anundj&aring;
you will also be the military leader in overall command.  I reviewed
the records about you in the Library; you have more experience leading
troops than everyone else in this room put together.  Apparently the
Writ requires that I maintain overall command but, in practice, I will
mostly be delegating that task to you, except for when I have some
tactic like the bombing that I need to implement."  He seemed
surprised but gave me a stiff nod. I reflected, just for a moment, on
the irony that I'd originally had to maim him to prevent him from
forcibly taking the very command authority that I was now freely
handing him.
</p>

<p>
"All four of you, make heavy use of the training arenas.  Focus on
training new magi first, because every new mage who can cast Summon
Monster increases the number of arenas we can have running.  Next
priority is clerics, as we're going to need all the Turn Undead power
we can get.  After that is military police, as they will need to be
slightly higher level than the common soldiers in order to be
effective police.  Duke Frederick, I'm sorry but the line troops will
have to take last priority."  He gave me another stiff nod; clearly he
didn't like it, but he understood the military necessities.
</p>

<p>
With his acceptance in hand I turned to the woman on his left.  "Lady
Merchant, your job will be to ensure the supply of weapons, food,
armor, and funding necessary to support the army.  Keep in mind that
we're going to be growing the army as fast as possible, so think big."
To be honest, I had no idea why she was even here; the Flobovian
economy was so detached from reality, economics, and common sense that
I couldn't see why there was a need for trade, guilds, or anything
else on those lines.  Shoot, I wasn't even sure why Flobovia needed
more than one merchant in the entire country, given that 'we buy
whatever we want in the marketplace, in unlimited quantities, without
ever affecting prices or interacting with logic' thing they had going
on.  And the existence of merchants who (presumably) made their living
buying and selling things was especially odd given the triviality of
making infinite money just by buying a ladder and selling back its
component parts.  (That still griped me.  This place was weird yes,
but did it have to be so <em>utterly</em> stupid?)
</p>

<p>
The most likely explanation was that guilds, trade caravans, farms and
the like existed in Flobovia simply because they were in the D&D
rulebooks and adventure modules.  And the game designers had put them
there, not because they were requirements for a functioning economy
and food supply, but in order to provide a backdrop for the players to
occasionally interact with as they wandered across the land like
psychotic hobos, killing everything that moved and stealing everything
that wasn't nailed down too tight to pry loose.
</p>

<p>
I shook the thought loose and, pausing for just a moment to accept
Lady Merchant's acquiescence, I turned to the final member of the
Conclave.
</p>

<p>
Lady Shadow was a bit of a puzzle.  Apparently, no one knew anything
about her, not even her real name.  This seemed odd, since she was
quite a noticeable woman; five foot ten, chocolate brown skin and
hair, large hazel eyes, and angular cheekbones (or, rather
'Cheekbones!!'&mdash;I was pretty sure I could shave with those).  My
best theory was that her appearance was a complex and probably magical
disguise; if people were focused on looking for a tall and very
noticeable dark-haired woman, they wouldn't notice the short, blonde,
plain woman&mdash;or man!&mdash;walking past.  I had no evidence for
that theory, of course, but it was the only reason I could think of
that Lady Justiciar wouldn't have managed to have someone follow Lady
Shadow from the Conclave meetings back to wherever she lived when she
wasn't running the Flobovian underworld.
</p>

<p>
"Lady Shadow, I need two things from you.  First, keep the crime under
tighter wraps than usual.  Don't let anyone do anything that would
interfere with the military or we're all dead.  Second, the more of
your thiev&mdash;<em>rogues</em> that you can convince to serve as
military scouts, the better.  Understood?"
</p>

<p>
Her mouth quirked into a small half-smile.  "Most of my people are
unlikely to want to serve; any who have a taste for scout work tend to
go off with adventuring parties.  That said, I can use the army as a
punishment for any rogue who breaks my rules.  You'll get your scouts,
but you'll need to find a way to keep them in line.  Gods know I have
trouble enough with that."
</p>

<p>
The Archpriest frowned to hear her say "gods" instead of "True God",
but he took a glance at me and reconsidered saying anything.  I
pretended not to notice.
</p>

<p>
Nodding in thanks, I turned back to Freddy-boy. "There's something
else I'd like you to take care of, Your Grace," I told him.  "I want
you to be in charge of building the cannon and training troops with
them.  The cannon are a force multiplier; they let even commoners
represent a credible threat to any corporeal enemy.  The faster we can
get them built and into use, the better.  I strongly suggest you use
the commoners, Your Grace; build units of cannoneers out of commoners
with one or two soldiers as officers.  Figure out a way to transport
them quickly&mdash;my first thought was mule team, but maybe there's
something better.  You should also experiment with the electrical
generators; I've got a better firing system in mind, so we won't need
the generators to work the cannon anymore.  You'll need to do a lot of
experimentation to find the best way to use them, but I'm confident
that you're the man for it."  Actually, I was <em>not</em> confident
of that, but it would keep him focused on thinking up ways to kill our
enemies instead of ways to depose and / or kill me.  And if he came up
with any useful tactics...hey, bonus.
</p>

<p>
Well, I <em>did</em> have a practical goal along with the desire for a
distraction; I had committed to providing the Deorsi with cannons and,
by implication, cannoneers.  So the training actually was important,
but if all it did was keep Freddy busy then I would be fine with just
handing the Deorsi the cannon and letting them figure out how to use
them.
</p>

<p>
Which brought us to the next problem: how to make all those big lumps
of iron actually work.  And for that, I needed to get this meeting
done with.
</p>

<p>
Standing, I clapped my hands in an expression of resolve and beamed at
all of them.  "Ok, gentlemen and ladies.  There's a lot to get done in
not much time. From what we've been told an army of undead that dwarfs
that of the Deorsi might be showing up here any day.  We need to be
ready, and that means we each need to do our part.  You all know what
your part is, so let's be about it."
</p>

<p>
And with that I turned and strode out of the room, Thomas and Suze
trailing behind me.  I had a few hundred non-functional weapons that I
needed to make functional before anyone figured out that they were
really just big doorstops.  Fortunately, I had the solution in my
pocket.
