<em><strong>Author's Note</strong>:  Still don't own D&D.</em>
</p>


<hr />

<p>
My armchair was ridiculously comfortable&mdash;heavily overstuffed,
soft velvety cover, armrests at just the right height.  I lounged, my
feet up on an equally perfect ottoman, sipping my chai latte and
enjoying Allison's toasty heat.  Occasionally I would ponder getting
up, sauntering over to the dark cherry shelves a few yards away, and
taking down one of the thousands of leather-bound books that waited
for me, pages full of exciting stories and absorbing science, art,
math....
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure how long it took before I noticed the wrongnesses about
the room.  For one thing, where in Stupidworld would I get a chai
latte?  Second, the last thing I remembered, I was still in
Gr&#491;fhamr&mdash;where would I find a room yards across?  And why
would Allison be here?  And why was everything fuzzy and distorted?
</p>

<p>
"You're dreaming, dumbass," Allison said.
</p>

<p>
I pondered that for a couple of minutes, trying to understand it.
</p>

<p>
"Huh?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
Allison gave a great, heaving sigh.  "Dreaming, dork.
D-R-E-A-M-I-N-G.  Do me a favor? Don't piss her off.  I really don't
want to be rended into tiny little aetheric fragments and scattered
across every layer of the Abyss."
</p>

<p>
I frowned.  That sounded like a bad thing. 
</p>

<p>
"Not exactly dreaming, little salamander," the woman in the chair
across from mine put in quietly.  "More like the potential for a
dream.  I'm only a potentiality myself for now, so I can't very well
create a real dream."  She was hard to understand; her voice blurred,
as though there were other people saying the same or similar words at
the same time.
</p>

<p>
I looked over to her slowly; I was feeling disconnected and it was
hard to focus on anything.
</p>

<p>
I didn't know who she was, but I had a feeling that I <em>should</em>
know, and that it was important that I figure it out.  Whoever she
was, she was striking&mdash;six foot one, silver hair, and a face that
was unlined and somewhat horsey&mdash;long and square, with a
masculine chin.  She was looking at me, expectantly.
</p>

<p>
"Say hello, Jake!  For the love of the Flame, say hello!" Allison
urged, throwing a spark onto my hand as a prompt.  I jumped, shook my
hand, and stuck it in my mouth to soothe the pain.
</p>

<p>
Obnoxious or not, Allison's little ouchie had helped cut through some
of my logginess.  "You're...Herr&uacute;n," I guessed, still having to
push through a mental fog to articulate that.
</p>

<p>
Allison hurried into the conversational breach.  "Please excuse him,
Your Ladyship, he's a bit of an idiot.  What he meant to say, Your
Ladyship, was 'Welcome, Your Ladyship, it's an honor to meet you.'
Right, Jake?"  Her voice was quite pointed, and a little bit scared.
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n smiled at her.  "Relax, little salamander.  I have no
quarrel with you.  I've always enjoyed your kind...your True Names are
such delicious secrets, and you learn so much during your various
sojourns on the Prime Material.  Over the centuries you accumulate
great knowledge and many secrets.  All this, yet such a
straightforward people; I find it most refreshing."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, well," said Allison, sounding much relieved.  "That's good.
Um...as to Jake, could you go easy on him?  He's a dork, but I kinda
like him.  Please?"
</p>

<p>
She waved Allison quiet and turned to face me.  "Yes, Jacob.  I am
Herr&uacute;n, Lady of Secrets.  And we need to talk."
</p>

<p>
I was pretty sure that those words were bad, but I couldn't remember
why.  My head was fuzzy and scattered, as though someone had spun the
focus knob all the way off.
</p>

<p>
"Why'm I so out of it?" I asked, having to concentrate hard to keep my
thoughts organized long enough to turn them into sounds.
</p>

<p>
She smiled...sadly? Ironically? I couldn't focus enough to tell.
"Like I said, <em>potential</em> for a dream.  It's not quite
happening, and yet it's happening to all of the 'yous' that could
exist right now, if you had made slightly different choices. The
various versions of you are overlapping a bit, hence the confusion."
</p>

<p>
I tried to follow that, but couldn't; my thoughts skittered away as I
tried to grasp the concepts.
</p>

<p>
I abandoned the effort and instead groped around for what I should say
next.  There was something I should be asking, but what...?
</p>

<p>
Oh, right.  "Why are you here?" I asked.  
</p>

<p>
She nodded in slight approval.  "We need to talk about you and your
decisions," she told me, steel in her voice.  "You blew up my temple,
Jake.  The greatest repository of knowledge and secrets in the world,
and my last foothold of existence on this plane.  In the process, you
killed eleven hundred and thirty one people, all of them full of
secrets. Among which were five pregnancies that no one knew about
yet&mdash;rather large secrets, considering the impact they would have
had on those people's lives."  There was something in her eyes that
promised doom; it wasn't as terrifying as what I had seen when Loki
had decided to make his presence felt, but baby tigers grow into adult
tigers given time.
</p>

<p>
I tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to muse on that for a minute.  "Um," I
said brilliantly.
</p>

<p>
"In fairness," she continued, "you were laboring under a mind rewrite
at the time.  As a result, I'm going to give you a stay of execution.
But you'd better make it up to me, Jake.  In a big way."  The threat
was far more obvious now, the claws flexing visibly.
</p>

<p>
I focused hard, bringing to bear every scrap of my amplified
intelligence to push through the haze.  "I already decided what I
would sacrifice to you. Is that enough?"
</p>

<p>
She frowned; her eyes glowed blue-white and her fingers twitched as
though sorting through threads.  She faded as she did, becoming
translucent.  As she did, the fuzziness in my head receded and the
room around me vanished into a cloud of fog.
</p>

<p>
"It's too far out for me to know it yet.  Say it," she demanded.
</p>

<p>
I nodded, finally feeling clear enough to lay out something more than
six words long.  It still required focus, but I could put the thoughts
together.
</p>

<p>
"Simple: take off and nuke the site from orbit.  It's the only way to
be sure."  I was pretty proud of myself for the allusion.
</p>

<p>
She raised an eyebrow.  "What?"
</p>

<p>
I leaned forward a bit, blinking and forcing my thoughts into
alignment again.  I was better than I had been, but still
muzzy-brained.
</p>

<p>
"Find a new world for us and move all of Gr&#491;fhamr's people
there," I began.  "Then use Polymorph Any Object to create about a
couple trillions tons of antimatter to vaporize this entire
planet&mdash;funny thing about PAO, it has a size limit on the source
object but not on the destination object so, yeah."  I shook my head
in disgust at the yet-more-examples of stupidity in Stupidworld's
magic.  "It would kill the liches and destroy their phylacteries so
they couldn't come back...well, assuming their phylacteries are
somewhere here instead of on another plane.  The incorporeals would
survive, of course, but they'd be left floating in empty space in full
sunlight."
</p>

<p>
Allison choked.  Herr&uacute;n turned to her, one eyebrow raised and
an expression that was not-quite-yet annoyed.  Allison's flame
contracted in on itself, huddling into a tiny flicker; Herr&uacute;n
studied her for a moment longer, then nodded in satisfaction and
turned back to me, considering my words.
</p>

<p>
She tipped her head in thought; vaguely, I noticed that she had grown
more solid as I spoke, and I could now make out details of the way her
hair shifted when she moved her head.  "I see.  And how would you
locate the new world for your people?"
</p>

<p>
I shrugged. "The Stupi...this world's universe is, presumably, as
large as my own&mdash;nigh infinite, for practical purposes.  There're
also other realities parallel to this one, mine being one of them, but
they're all variations on the Prime Material Planes and most likely
not other planes per se.  Assuming this is something like the
Copenhagen Model, the number of these realities is probably either
infinite or so large that it might as well be infinite."
</p>

<p>
I paused to make sure she was following.  She nodded impatiently,
making a 'get on with it' gesture with one hand.  I hurried to
continue.  It might be best to let sleeping dogs lie, but it was even
best-er to keep impatient goddesses happy, 'only a potentiality' or
not.
</p>

<p>
Especially since I was the one who'd blown up her temple and I had a
feeling that she was going to kill me if I wasn't really super awesome
nice to her.
</p>

<p>
"I'd talk to an artist," I told her.  "Describe a made-up imaginary
world for him, have him draw it.  Somewhere in the multiverse, that
world almost certainly exists.  With the picture, you can use Greater
Scrying to locate that world.  Use Greater Teleport to send a mage
there&mdash;with proper protections against the environment, of
course&mdash;so she can scout it and make sure it's safe.  Once we
know that it is, use Gr&#491;fhamr to transport the surviving Deorsi
there.
</p>

<p>
"Once everyone was safely there, send one mage back here to blow the
place up," I finished.  Immediately, I got worried that she'd be
offended by the idea of me using a suicide bomber, so I hurred to
correct that impression.  "She could Shapechange into a ghost or some
other incorporeal so as to be immune to the blast, and then Greater
Teleport to us once the world was gone."
</p>

<p>
She nodded, intrigued.  "What about the gods of the undead?  Wouldn't
they strike you down after you did this?"
</p>

<p>
I shifted uncomfortably in my dream-chair.  "Well...maybe.  But there
seems to be a link between the power of the god and the number of
worshippers.  It might just be that more powerful gods attract more
worshippers, but what if the link is causal and goes in the other
direction?  What if number of worshippers dictates the power of the
god?  In that case, you would have destroyed all of the evil gods'
worshippers and they'd be dead or powerless.  Either way, no threat.
And...it seems plausible.  You...died?...vanished?...became whatever
it is you are now, when all of your worshippers vanished.  Again,
could have been that they vanished because you went away, but I
thought maybe it went the other way."
</p>

<p>
She looked me right in the eyes while nodding slowly; her lips curled
into a small smile as she did.  "Interesting thought; I can't confirm
it, of course.  But you said you'd save the Gr&#491;fhamrites; what
about the people of Arannias&mdash;the Flobovians, Tarisians, and so
on?  Why not rescue them as well?"
</p>

<p>
I grimaced but forced myself to say it.  The words came out slowly, my
rationality forcing them past my traditional moral sense; from a
utilitarian viewpoint, this was correct; from a
normal-society-morality viewpoint it was horrific.  "I thought about
that, but it would be better not to.  They worship too many different
gods, and some of those people are evil and worship evil
gods&mdash;possibly even the ones we're facing now.  Those gods might
have an incentive to smack us; there's no way to be sure.  If we keep
the survivors confined to the gods of Gr&#491;fhamr, we can be sure
that all the surviving gods are on our side.  And, under the
conditions that prevail in Gr&#491;fhamr, it's vanishingly unlikely
that any of the people here are evil, or worship any of the enemy
gods.  Everyone is too tightly packed; the evil ones would have been
found out and executed."
</p>

<p>
"Hmmm," she said, steepling her fingers.  She was looking more solid
by the minute, and the room around me was looking...present, although
still shrouded in thick fog.  "What if the evil gods had worshippers
on other planes, enough worshippers to keep them strong after you
destroyed their worshippers here?"
</p>

<p>
I shrugged.  "We're not going to win this war without taking some
risks.  According to Albrecht, the gods of the undead are
'nigh-omnipotent'.  Yet they haven't taken any direct action against
us yet; why not?  There must be something that prevents them from
acting, or we'd all be dead already.  Whatever that is, why wouldn't
it continue after those gods were weakened?"
</p>

<p>
One divine eyebrow went up and the fingers tapped against each other
in thought.  "Interesting.  Did Master Sage Einarr tell you all this
about gods?"
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.  "No, this is all my thinking.  I haven't shared it
with anyone yet."
</p>

<p>
She nodded thoughtfully.  "Interesting indeed.  Very well.  Why did
you decide to sacrifice this secret?"
</p>

<p>
"It's too horrible," I admitted.  "Rationally, it's the right thing to
do.  The odds are too high against us; if we're right about the
Polymorph engines creating limitless undead, then we can't win by
attrition.  The Lich Kings are dangerous enough on their own, but we
can't actually kill them unless we can figure out where their
phylacteries are, and we don't have any reasonable way to do that."  I
paused.  "Unless you felt like telling us?" I asked hopefully.
</p>

<p>
She shook her head with a sardonic smile.  "My domain is secrets and
knowledge.  Right now I'm only a potentiality; I can't afford to
weaken myself any further by just <em>giving</em> away any of my
domain."
</p>

<p>
I shrugged.  "Didn't think so.  Anyway.  If we can't find their
phylacteries we can't take out the Lich Kings. Without being able to
take them out we can't shut off their spell engines&mdash;they would
just rebuild.  Given time, they'll kill every living thing on the
planet; destroying the planet would at least allow us to save
something.  The utility calculations say that I should do it.  I
just...can't.  I'm just not cold blooded enough.  I can't kill
practically every human, all the dogs and cats, all the baby seals,
destroy all the art and libraries that all the sentient life has
accumulated.  It's too much.  But, if things got bad enough...I would.
I don't want to die, and I'm afraid that eventually it would start to
look appealing."
</p>

<p>
"Hm," she murmured, pursing her lips in thought.  I waited for what
she would say next, trying not to wring my hands in nervousness.
</p>

<p>
Finally, she seemed to come to a conclusion.  "All right," she
stated. "The only way you know to save the lives of yourself and
millions of others, while defeating a massive evil that threatens to
destroy the world?  An important secret indeed.  Very well, sacrifice
that secret to me and I'll forgive your destruction of my temple."
She met my eyes for a moment and my guts turned to melted Jello.  "Do
not act counter to My interest in the future, Jacob.  I will not
forgive you again."
</p>

<p>
I nodded frantically, over and over like a demented bobblehead doll
until she faded from view.  Those terrifying, soul-devouring eyes were
the last things to fade away.  Once they finally did, I found myself
gasping in relief and....
</p>

<p>
...I jerked upright in bed, slamming my head on the too-close ceiling
and collapsing back into the pillow.  The bedding was soaked in sweat,
and the light sheet&mdash;all that was necessary in the constant,
oppressive heat of Gr&#491;fhamr&mdash;was tangled around me like
swaddling.  Thomas and Duncan were standing next to me looking
concerned; over their shoulders I could see half a dozen other
Landguard packing the doorway and hall.
</p>

<p>
I wasn't really paying attention to that, though, being far more
concerned about the blood pouring from my nose and the blinding pain
of what I was pretty sure was a concussion.  Possibly a split-open
skull.  Maybe I was dying?  That sounded pretty good right now.
</p>

<p>
"Ow," I muttered, the word muffled by the blood that was stuffing up
my nose.
</p>

<p>
Thomas's lips twitched in amusement and Duncan snorted.  The crusty
old Sergeant&mdash;a.k.a., 'that sadistic bastard'&mdash;poked me in
the nose with one finger, inducing a white-hot flare of agony, and
muttered "Lay On Hands."  The familiar sensation of warm golden light
washed through me, the pain vanished, and my nose was whole again.
</p>

<p>
"You couldn't have poked me in the <em>arm</em>?" I muttered grumpily.
</p>

<p>
Duncan laughed.  "You're welcome."
</p>

<p>
"Gotta be a dungheap around here somewhere," I grumbled, swinging my
legs off the bed and dropping carefully to the floor.  (For the
record; standing in between two armored-up hyper-fit superwarriors in
your boxers and deskjockey belly is an uncomfortable and embarrassing
experience.  I recommend against it.)
</p>

<p>
"We need to talk to Albrecht," I told them, pulling my jeans on and
revelling in their cleanliness and suppleness.  Having seen that
Prestidigitation trick the Gr&#491;fhamrites used to clean the walls I
had asked Bob if he knew the spell.  He did, and was happy to use it
to thoroughly launder my otherworldly clothes.  It meant that I could
wear them every day from now on and not have to worry about the stupid
fasteners of Stupidworld's stupid clothing.
</p>

<p>
I shrugged into my trenchcoat and strode out of the room, Thomas and
Duncan falling into place in front and behind.
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
"So that's the story," I finished.  "I'm pretty sure that it wasn't
just a dream.  Too linear and detailed for that, and the whole 'divine
death stare of deadly dire doom' thing was too convincing to be just a
memory."
</p>

<p>
"It does sound like a true vision," Master Sage Einarr concurred.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, what do we make of it?  Also, how are we coming on the ritual?
And that whole 'not being detected and killed' thing?  And&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht held up a hand.  "One at a time, Jake.  To answer your
question, we realized that we were being foolish about the fear of
detection.  The <em>Sky Slayer</em> solved this problem long ago; they
fly, high enough that their Weirdstone doesn't affect the ground, and
they are constantly moving.  We don't happen to have an airship handy,
but when the time comes we'll have one of our mages use Overland
Flight to take Gr&#491;fhamr into the sky.  Every few hours we'll swap
magi and keep the city in the air from then on."
</p>

<p>
I frowned.  "How will you swap magi?  If he's carrying it, the city is
closed.  For that matter, how will we breathe?  I thought there was
only a little bit of air in here without the door open."
</p>

<p>
"We took your suggestion about the Darsson's Cooling Breeze spells,"
Unn supplied, seeming pleased.  "We set up thousands of them, all
through the city, and used your Hourglass to make them permanent.
We're now entirely independent of outside air."
</p>

<p>
Thomas frowned.  "The city is huge.  How did you get the Hourglass to
all the...."  He broke off, nodding in understanding.  "You formed
another railgun to move the Hourglass around, didn't you?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht nodded.  "Yes.  We can't take off until the ritual is
complete, though.  It's in progress now; any disruption will cause it
to fail."
</p>

<p>
I raised an eyebrow at that.  "I was expecting it to take more time
than that to get everything organized.  Didn't you have to set up
schedules for who would be moving when, so that there was enough room
in the halls?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht shrugged.  "We're a group of refugees organized on military
lines.  We're good at making schedules."
</p>

<p>
"Huh.  So, how does that work, exactly?" I asked, curious.
</p>

<p>
"With the reorganization of the city, the distance to the door is less
than a standard move for most of the residents," Drifa told me.
"People can run out the door, drop their secret in the fire on their
assigned altar, say their prayer, and keep running into the segment of
Gr&#491;fhamr that was set up opposite their starting point.  They run
as deep as they can into the city, then climb up into one of the Rope
Tricks so that they can stop without being in anyone's way.  By having
people running <em>in</em> from the left and <em>out</em> from the
right, we can make it so that only the door is a choke point.  It's
wide enough to fit two people if they squeeze and we've already moved
sixty or seventy thousand people through.  At this rate, the ritual
should be complete in about four days."
</p>

<p>
"I must say, it's a very efficient method; I congratulate you all,"
said the brown-haired half-elf who had just sauntered into the room.
He leaned carelessly against the wall by the door, arms folded and
smiling.
</p>

<p>
Before his back touched the wall, Alpha Squad was on him, blurring
towards him with blades out.
</p>

<p>
They didn't even get close.
</p>

<p>
A thin black ribbon of force appeared in the air in front of the
intruder, stretching from wall to wall; it came into existence so
close to the charging paladins that they never had a chance to dodge.
Robert and Rob, leading the charge, got clotheslined flat and went
down in a heap, tangling the others and preventing them from closing
the distance.
</p>

<p>
Thomas surged to his feet and drew his blades as he moved around the
table to get between me and the stranger. Duncan's swords were already
in his hands; before Thomas could get around me, Duncan tapped his
blades together, shutting down all magic in the area.  Instantly, the
room vanished as we were dumped out of the Magnificent Mansion we'd
been sitting in, fell into the enclosing segment of Gr&#491;fhamr
(Violet #4791, as it happened), and that Portable Hole was shut down
and separated from the rest of the city.
</p>

<p>
The Hole contained me,  Duncan, and the stranger.  I was
pressed against the back wall; had I been one seat to the right I
would have been in the next segment and safe.  As it was, I was going
to have the opportunity to watch Sergeant Duncan administer a beatdown
to someone who <em>wasn't</em> me.  I felt a little sorry for the guy,
really.
</p>

<p>
The stranger gave Duncan a smile and a Jedi wave.  "Relax, my friend.
I'm no threat.  You don't really want to attack me, do you?  It seems
like such an unnecessary action.  I'm sure we can find a peaceful way
to coexist if you'll just refrain from fighting for a minute or so."
</p>

<p>
Duncan arrested his momentum, straightened up, and smiled.
A <em>friendly</em> smile.  I almost fainted.
</p>

<p>
The stranger smiled back; he pushed himself up from the wall and
stretched out a hand to Duncan.  "Won't you be kind enough to turn off
that anti-magic field, friend?  If you'll forgive me, it seems a
little rude."
</p>

<p>
Duncan <em>looked abashed.</em>  I almost fainted again.
</p>

<p>
"Right, of course.  Sorry, sir," he said, tapping his swords together
in embarrassment.  No longer suppressed by his antimagic, the Mansion
blinked back into visibility around us, along with the other
inhabitants of the room.  Every one of them looked alarmed.
</p>

<p>
"Hello all," the stranger said.  "I'm here peacefully, with no intent
to fight.  Can't we be friends?"
</p>

<p>
Everyone relaxed back into their seats, smiling genially.
</p>

<p>
"Pleased to meet you," Thomas said.  "Let me introduce you.  I'm
Thomas Rheinhart, Commander of the Landguard.  This is High Marshal
Albrecht L&ouml;fgren, his grandnephew Colborn, Master High Mage Unn
Lager, Master High Priestess Drifa Hummel and, last but not least, His
Imperial Majesty Jacob, Emperor of Flobovia.  Who might you be, sir,
and what can we do for you?"
</p>

<p>
The stranger waved in a friendly fashion.  "Well, taking those in
reverse order, I'm here to do a little diplomacy; I think your people
and mine have gotten off on the wrong foot, and we should really work
together more.  As to who I am, my name's Afi."
</p>

<em><strong>Author's Note part 2:</strong> For the benefit of non-D&D
players: there is a skill called Diplomacy which allows the user to
change the attitude of NPCs as regards himself.  If you're *really*
good at it, you can take someone who is Hostile to you (meaning,
'willing to take risks in order to hurt you') and make them Helpful
('willing to take risks to help you') in the span of six seconds.
It's utterly terrifying how completely broken it is.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Needless to say, Afi is *really* good at it.</em>

<p>
<em>Oh, and thanks to Nepene on the GitP forums for giving me the idea
