is an excellent author with some truly great Firefly and Castle 'fic
that you should totally check out.  I mention this because she has
given me several pieces of useful critique and/or suggestion.
Seriously, go read her stuff.  You'll be glad you did.</em>

<p>
The scribing work went on through the night, new wizards rotating in
as the originals got tired.  I stayed up until the wee hours, then
crashed for a bit; the entire Landguard spent the night in my room,
four of them sleeping in their armor and four of them beside the bed,
two on either side, swords drawn.  Despite the deep, luxurious
mattress and the silk sheets, it was probably the most uncomfortable
night of my life, the worry making my belly tie itself in knots.
(Also, silk sheets?  What was this, the Playboy mansion?  They sound
romantic and all, but I kept sliding off the dang bed.)</p>

<p>I woke up to the sound of someone pounding on my door and calling
for me frantically.  "M'Lord, M'Lord, wake up!  The Deorsi are
here!"</p>

<p>I was up and out of bed before my brain caught up, adrenaline
flooding through me.  Harry and Franklin, the two Landguard at the
foot of the bed, were already opening the door.  Thomas and the others
who had been asleep were surging to their feet, blades out.</p>

<p>No time to futz with weird clothes, so I grabbed my blue jeans off
the chair and thrust one leg in, hopping a bit to catch my balance
before I could get the other leg in and get the pants buttoned.  Then
I looked up at the messenger.</p>

<p>He was a brown-haired man in his mid-thirties, probably one of the
downstairs stewards.  He was badly out of breath, clearly having run
to get here; as the door opened, he bent over, hands on his knees,
trying to get his breath back.</p>

<p>"Where are they, John?  How many?  And when did they start
arriving?" demanded Thomas.</p>

<p>"It's just...a dozen...of them, Commander," he said, huffing and
puffing.  "They're waiting at...the near edge of...Jeweler's Square.
They appeared maybe thirty...minutes ago, and they're asking for parley
with His Lordship."</p>

<p>Interestingly, it turns out that, although arguing with my mother
is still the Most Frustrating Thing In The History of Ever, arguing
with a paladin is a close second.  And both of those things are so
much more frustrating than arguing with a brick wall that you can't
even find "brick wall" on the frustration chart.  Thomas was
determined that I wouldn't go anywhere near the Deorsi, and I was
determined that I would.</p>

<p>After the first few rounds of yes-I-will-no-you-won't, I recognized
the victory play:  "If I can negotiate a truce with them, we'll save
millions of lives.  It would be a good thing for the Land."</p>

<p>Thomas glared, but couldn't refute me.  I knew it was a cheap shot,
but if there was any chance of achieving peace I was determined to
take it.  Not that I actually expected it to be possible (hellooooo,
Genre Savvy here!) but I still had to try.</p>

<p>"Look, I'm not stupid, Thomas.  This almost certainly isn't for
real&mdash;they're winning, and between their numbers, their mages,
and that teleportation trick of theirs they're going to be almost
impossible to beat.  There's no reason for them to actually negotiate
for peace; most likely this is a demand for our surrender.  If not,
then it's probably a delaying tactic, a probe for information, or a
straight up trick.  But no matter what it is, talking to them is a
good idea.  If by some miracle they do want to make peace, we should
take it.  And if not, maybe we can get information from them, or
interfere with their plan, whatever it is."</p>

<p>He looked thoughtful at that.  "Fair enough.  But you're going with
more than just the eight of us.  We'll grab a few regulars, plus the
three special squads that are in the city."

<p>"Sounds good to me.  I have no interest in getting captured or
killed.  There's something else we can bring though.  How many
Portable Holes did we manage to scare up?"</p>

<p>He frowed.  "A couple dozen, why?"</p>

<p>I grinned.  "I've got a hell of a surprise in mind for the
Deorsi."</p>

<center>o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o</center>

<p>
It took a couple of hours to get everything and everyone together, but
we were finally standing in front of the Deorsi in Jeweler's Square.
Thomas wasn't kidding about the protective detail; he had brought all
eight surviving Landguard, fifteen members of the Special Squads who
looked almost as deadly as the 'Guard, all three of the Archmagi, the
Archpriest and no less than twelve of his Hierophants and High
Priests, and "a few" regular army soldiers...by which I mean, the
entire eighty-seven-man Edolian Cuirassiers company.  The Cuirassiers
were elite cavalry from the hilly northwest; they fought with lance,
sword, and lightning wand, and were frequently blooded against the
many bandits infesting the northern edge of Edolia. Good troops to
have at your back.  (And the irrelevant fact that Edolia was ruled by
Duke Frederick, my nemesis on the Conclave, didn't bother me in the
slightest.  Nope, nope, nope.  Honestly, the mere fact that my back
was being covered by elite troops from Freddie's home state, who were
probably highly loyal to him, didn't set even one tiny little bit of
skin-crawling worry sliding icily up and down my spine. Really.)</p>

<p>Almost a hundred and fifty bodyguards to meet with a dozen people.
It was a bit like the President going to lunch with a foreign
dignitary while being escorted by Delta Force, the Green Berets, and a
panzer division.  (Yes, yes, I know: panzers are German, not American.
Back off, it's an awesome word.)
</p>

<p>
Waiting for us was a small group surrounding a short, portly man in
his early fifties, brown hair shot with grey, and a face like a
cherub.  His well-worn uniform had no decorations or signs of rank but
the way his companions deferred to him made it painfully clear that he
was in charge.
</p>

<p>
Their leader may have looked like someone's favorite uncle, but his
companions were something entirely different.  Of the people standing
around him, six were clearly wizards; the staves in hand, wands in
belts, spell component pouches, and robes (three of which <em>actually
had stars embroidered on them</em>!) were a bit of a giveaway.  Two
others were high level clerics, if the religious objects hanging from
their necks were anything to go by.  The remaining seven were four men
and three women in armor, all of whom looked like human wolverines and
had bared steel in their hands (gripped <em>in</em> their hands, not
coming <em>from</em> their hands&mdash;different kind of wolverines).
They formed a ring around the others, facing out, glaring at everyone
nearby.  It was abundantly clear that they were prepared to shred
anyone who made the slightest hostile move, or implied a hostile move,
or just sort of looked vaguely like they might idly consider making a
hostile move at some unknown point in the future.
</p>

<p>
Standing next to an armed nuke would have been more stressful.  Maybe.
Well, probably.  But this situation was still clearly a powder keg,
and it needed to be defused fast.
</p>

<p>
Their cherubic leader caught sight of my party and stepped forward,
pushing past his bodyguard and smiling widely.  "Ah, welcome!  You
must be the new ruler of this fine land...Jake, was it?  May I call
you Jake, or would you prefer to keep this formal and titled?  If so,
please let me know what title you've chosen.  And let's see...you must
be Thomas, Commander of the Landguard, correct?  I must say, your
troops are simply astounding!  Congratulations on creating such an
elite fighting force&mdash;truly, they do you proud.  And, hmm...you,
sirs, must be Archmage Isaac Davidson, Archmage Reynard Aguillard, and
Archmage Matthew of no last name that we've been able to discover.
Quite impressive, all of you!  Everything I've heard has said that you
are all exceptionally gifted, not to mention powerful; I'm simply
delighted to meet you.  My companion, Highmage Lukas Kappel," he waved
to a tall mage with an aquiline nose behind him, "has expressed a
strong desire to meet with you to discuss your discoveries in...ah,
what was it Lukas?  'Divination and how it relates to planar
boundaries' if I recall properly?  In any case, yes, the four of you
really should make some time to sit down together.  And, finally, last
but by no means least, Archpriest Michael, son of John.  Sir, your
reputation precedes you and that reputation is as a shining beacon in
the night, guiding your flock to safety and peace.  I'm so glad you
could be here; it truly is an honor."
</p>

<p>
Crickets chirped somewhere.  Not in the city.  But somewhere.  
</p>

<p>
After a minute, I kicked my brain back into gear.  "Ah, thank you....?"
</p>

<p>
He actually slapped his forehead (who does that??).  "I do apologize,
in the excitement of meeting you all I forgot to introduce myself.
High Marshal Albrecht L&ouml;fgren, at your service."
</p>

<p>
I was again a bit bollixed; this bubbly, friendly man was the
commander of the massive army that was stomping everything in their
path with ruthless efficiency?  That had completely eradicated two
entire cities full of people, killing everything down to domestic
pets?  Clearly, this universe was even more fundamentally broken than
I had thought; villains are supposed to be...well, villainous.  Where
was his eerily billowing cape? Where was the finely waxed mustache?
The white cat, even??  Seriously, what did a guy have to do to get an
archnemesis with some professional pride?
</p>

<p>
I finally managed a limping response to His Effusiveness.  "Thank you,
High Marshal.  If you don't mind my asking...what exactly <em>are</em>
you doing here?"
</p>

<p>
He smiled broadly, as delighted as a child eating ice cream while
watching his school burn to the ground.  "I simply <em>had</em> to
meet anyone creative enough to conceive of that meteor strike tactic.
It was an expensive lesson, but no lesson worth the learning doesn't
have a cost.  However much I regret the loss of my men, it was utterly
brilliant, and I appreciate you teaching us such an effective tactic."
</p>

<p>
Oh crap.  My stomach dropped straight through my feet and into the
Earth's core.  I hadn't thought of the possibility of them turning
around and bombing <em>us</em>.  And since they had more powerful
mages than we did they would be able to pull it off more easily and
more frequently than we could.  I had just shown them how to destroy
entire cities with no cost to themselves.
</p>

<p>
This was not my best day ever.
