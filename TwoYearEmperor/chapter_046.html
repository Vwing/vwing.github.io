<em><strong>Author's Note</strong>:  Still don't own D&D.</em>
</p>


<hr />

<p>
I smiled at Colborn and got ready to knock the pins out from under his
world.
</p>

<p>
"First off," I told him, still smiling wickedly.  "I'm not from around
here.  I mean, I am <em>really</em> not from around here.  Your rules
don't quite apply to me; for example, I can't be resurrected, I get
tired if I crank a heavy generator for even a minute, and the size and
shape matter when I carry things.  For y'all, there's a bloody
revolving door on the afterlife, you only get tired if you run for
hours, and being able to carry something is only about the weight, not
the center of gravity.  There's a couple other differences between you
and me, but we'll get to those in a minute.
</p>

<p>
"Unrelated to the above, did you know that magic items are not the
same thing as items that have a spell on them?  Funny thing; you take
a magic item that can cast Light at will and you break it in half, it
stops working. If the Light spell was active, it goes out.  But!  You
take some random object, put Light on it, and break the object in
half...well, all you've done is move some atoms around.  Both halves
of the thing still glow."
</p>

<p>
I shrugged.  "Different spells behave differently, of course.  Put
Explosive Runes on a piece of paper and tear through the middle, what
do you get?  Well, if you tore around the runes, you have a piece of
paper that's perfectly safe and a piece of paper that's
decidedly <em>unsafe</em> because it will literally blow up in your
face if you look at it wrong.  On the other hand, if you
tear <em>through</em> the runes, then the magic goes away.  Sometimes
rather explosively, but it goes away."  I paused to ponder the
mysteries of such things.  "Let me tell you, that was an interesting
series of experiments&mdash;rather in the 'may you live in interesting
times' sense of the word, but definitely interesting.  Anyway.  Where
was I?"

<p>
"Are you going to get on with this or&mdash;" began an exasperated
Colborn.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" I said, talking over him.  "Right.  Breaking enchanted
non-magical objects.  So, there seems to be an upper limit; if you
really and truly destroy something&mdash;break it down too far, set it
on fire, drop it in acid, throw it into the magma surging up from the
deepest roots of Mount Plot Device&mdash;well, then the magic turns
off.  But, as long as the majority of the object is still relatively
intact, you can break it into multiple pieces and the spell keeps
chugging right along.  Ain't magic wacky?"  I gave him a sunny smile
just for the joy of watching him grind his teeth.
</p>

<p>
"Anyway, back to the story.  Let me tell you about the <em>second</em>
time that the gods showed up to tell me that I shouldn't break the
game...."
</p>

<p>
I paused, cocking my head in thought.  "Actually, let's do it the
other way around.  Duncan, wheel one of the cannon up here, would
you?  And grab a cannister shot."
</p>

<p>
The crusty old sergeant saluted crisply, executed a perfect
about-face, and double timed down the hill.  Thomas had been busily
flipping the tarps off of the array of what could now be seen to be
eighty cannon in eight rows of ten.  Once they had all been exposed,
Thomas had gotten busy pulling some long wooden columns out of a bunch
of Portable Holes and carefully stacking them at the south- and
northwest corners of the array.
</p>

<p>
Duncan ignored all this and just grabbed the nearest cannon; with his
enhanced strength he rolled the ridiculously heavy thing up the hill
to us with the thoughtless ease that a toddler uses to push his Tonka
truck across the rug.
</p>

<p>
All of the cannon, including this one, were heavily modified.  The
front eighteen inches of the barrel had been sliced horizontally and
the top half of the barrel removed, leaving a short trough sticking
out from the new, shorter barrel.  The entrance of the barrel was
covered with a square of heavy black velvet.
</p>

<p>
Duncan pushed it up to the military crest&mdash;just high enough that
we could see over the top and down into the valley below us, while
still having cover from the hill.  Once there, he chocked the wheels
so it couldn't roll backwards, then pulled a heavily wrapped cylinder
from his pouch and passed it to me.  A foot long and three inches in
diameter, it had substantial heft to it, and the wrappings were tied
on tightly with twine.
</p>

<p>
The single cannon delivered, Thomas and Duncan paced back to the
cannon array, stripped off their armor and weapons, and took up
positions at the northwest corner.  Thomas waited with empty hands,
while Duncan picked up half a dozen of the giant wooden telephone
poles and held them vertically with ridiculous ease.  He really
shouldn't have been able to do that, no matter how light they might
be.  He didn't have enough hands to manage all of them, and carrying a
twenty-five foot pole upright is impractical for anyone who lives in a
universe of physics instead of overly-abstract encumberance rules.
(Guess which kind of universe Stupidworld was?)
</p>

<p>
"Here, catch," I said, tossing the heavily wrapped package to Colborn.
He bobbled it, but managed to gain control before it hit the ground.
Irritated but curious, he reached for the cloth to unwrap it.
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't do that if I were you," I told him.  "Unwrap that and
you'll be dead before you can blink."
</p>

<p>
He looked up, anger suffusing his features.  "Are you threatening me?!
You&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nah, just giving fair warning," I told him breezily.  "If I were you,
I'd Polymorph into a human."
</p>

<p>
The anger was Polymorphing into rage.  "Now listen&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I turned to my loyal minions.  "Thomas, could you go grab Jary?" I
called.  "I asked him to have a Polymorph memorized today."  Thomas
nodded and vanished back into the rocks behind us.  Moments later, he
returned with Jary, the mage who had teleported us all here earlier.
Thomas wasn't exactly dragging him, but his hand on the young man's
shoulder was definitely not casual.
</p>

<p>
Pretty clearly, the short, blond wizard was nervous as a rabbit in a
wolf den at being this close to so many undead.  His eyes kept
flicking to the hill and the seething mass of incorporeal enemies just
below us.
</p>

<p>
"His Majesty has asked that you Polymorph Master High Mage Colborn
into a human," Thomas informed him.  The words were polite and the
tone outwardly gentle, but it was very clearly a directive, not a
piece of information.
</p>

<p>
Jary turned to Colborn uncertainly, his eyes flicking to the fangs
before studiously locking on to the wizard's face.  "Um...Master High
Mage?" he inquired uncertainly.
</p>

<p>
Colborn puffed himself up in anger.  "I will do no such thing!  Why in
the world would I want to be a puling human again?!  As a vampire, I'm
smarter, stronger, faster&mdash;better in every way.  Why would I give
that up?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht waved a hand at him in assurance.  "Do it, Colborn.  I've
never yet known Jake to make a frivolous demand.  If he says it's
important, it's important."
</p>

<p>
"Tell you what, Colborn...let yourself be Polymorphed and I'll credit
you with an even fifty thousand kills.  Don't you want to put the nail
in my coffin for this bet?"  I hesitated for a moment, realizing what
I'd said.  "Er, no offense intended.  Anyway, Jary can Polymorph you
back in a few minutes, right Jary?"
</p>

<p>
The young man gulped, his prominent Adams apple bobbing up and down,
then nodded spastically.  "Yes, Master High Mage, sir.  No trouble,
sir."
</p>

<p>
Colborn sneered but nodded grudging permission to Jary.  The young
mage stepped up and tapped him on the shoulder.  "Polymorph Other:
Human," he declared.  The universe kindly edited its config files and
rebooted; in a brief puff of magenta smoke, Colborn's vampiric body
was replaced by what must have been his original human form: exactly
the same except dumpier, with a weaker chin and no muscles.
</p>

<p>
I politely failed to notice the differences; instead I just nodded to
Thomas and waited while he took up his position by the cannon again.
"Excellent.  Let's get this show on the road.  Stand clear of the
cannon, y'all.  Albrecht, our forty-three rounds begins now."
</p>

<p>
Everyone took several prudent steps backwards; once they were clear I
faced them, dropped my voice as low as I could get it, and announced,
"Gentlemen, behold the power of this fully armed and operational
cannon," I declared.  "Fire!"
</p>

<p>
<em>Whang!</em> said the cannon, juddering a bit as the firing rod
slammed forward.  Its ammo load leapt out over the valley below,
tearing the black cloth away in the process.
</p>

<p>
It was easy to follow the path of the shot, because it was glowing
like a miniature sun from the fifty Celestial Brilliance spells that
had been placed on it.
</p>

<p>
It arced out and out, appearing to descend only grudgingly.  As soon
as it came low enough for its light to reach the ground, all the
undead in its path simply vaporized.  It dropped lower and lower,
tearing a line a hundred yards long and over a hundred feet wide
through the undead ranks.  Finally, it augured into the ground...and
exploded into dozens of spheres of light, each fully as large and
bright as the original, that leaped off in all directions, bouncing
crazily and unpredictably across the rocky valley below us.  Even when
they stopped bouncing and came to rest, they were only still for a
moment before an explosion would rock the field and send them bouncing
out again.  Each bouncing light source tore a swath through the enemy
ranks like dragonfire scorching a wheatfield.
</p>

<p>
Everyone stared in shocked silence as nearly a hundred thousand undead
vanished in a shower of ash.
</p>

<p>
I waited, rocking back and forth from heel to toe with a gleeful
smile until they all turned to face me again.  "Now," I told them
smugly.  "Since talking is a free action, let me proceed to tell you
the story of my last couple of days in great detail, which won't take
any time here in the present because your world is broken.
Specifically, let me spin for you the tale of how the gods told
me, <em>again</em>, to please stop breaking the world."
</p>

<p>
  <center><em><strong>~= two days before today =~</strong></em></center>
</p>

<p>
"Excellent," I said, smiling evilly as I handed Thomas back his
gauntlet. A six-second experiment had proven that I could, once again,
totally demolish the laws of this world. "Just like I thought.  Come
on, let's get back to Flobovia.  I need to grab some cash and we need
to buy this place a store.  Oh, and remind me to check on Explosive
Runes, too.  There's an experiment I want to run with those."
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
The chime above the door jingled as I walked into Merchant Max's
Marvelous Market, tagline 'You need it, we got infinite quantities of
it, as long as it's on the equipment charts!  All at low, low prices,
or at least the standard prices from the charts!'
</p>

<p>
Ok, that wasn't really the tagline, but it should have been.
</p>

<p>
"Good afternoon, folks!  How may I help&mdash;whoa!  Um, hello Your
Imperial Majesticness, sir, um...."  Max lost track of where he was
supposed to be going with that and just fell silent.  He seemed
nervous; I could tell because his walrus mustache was twitching and
his fingers kept plucking nervously at the buttons on his hideously
ugly paisley shirt.  He must have been the worst poker player in the
history of ever.
</p>

<p>
I waved a hand airily at him.  "Just 'Your Majesty' is fine, Max.  I
came in to buy a ladder; can you help me?"  I gestured and Suze
stepped forward, tugging open the drawstrings of a money pouch and
pouring some coins on the counter.  They made that pleasing ringing
sound when they hit, the one that means 'why yes!  I am in fact made
of solid gold, will you please take me home with you?'
</p>

<p>
Max shook himself and got back on track.  "Of course, Your Majesty.
Here you are."  He swept one of the golden coins off the counter,
dropped a handful of silver and copper in its place, and pulled a ten
foot ladder out from under the four-feet-tall-by-eight-feet-wide
counter.  I wanted to cry.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks Max," I said with a smile.  "By the way, would you like to buy
a couple of ten foot poles and some firewood?"
</p>

<p>
Max's swarthy face lit up.  "Absolutely!  Ten foot poles are always in
demand.  Adventurers buy 'em all the time."  He paused thoughtfully
for a moment.  "Although, lately I've been getting a lot of inquiries
about eleven foot poles and not touching things with a ten foot pole.
Not quite sure what to make of that."  He shook his head in confusion.
</p>

<p>
After a moment of bemusement, he pushed the thought of adventurers
trying to buy non-standard items from his mind and turned back to us.
Immediately, he frowned in concern.  "Are the poles outside?" he asked
uncertainly, looking at our remarkably pole-free hands.
</p>

<p>
"Nope," I sighed.  "Right here."  I nodded to Duncan; he set the
ladder on edge, put one foot on the bottom side to keep it in place,
and yanked.  With a teeth-grating squeal of pegs tearing loose, the
thing came apart.  A couple of casual swipes knocked loose the few
rungs that were still attached, and then Duncan laid the two uprights
on the counter and dumped the rungs in a pile next to them.
</p>

<p>
Max tucked the pieces of his ladder away behind the counter with a
beatific smile.  "Excellent!  Thank you, Your Majesty.  Good quality
poles, these.  And the firewood is nice&mdash;already split and ready
to go.  I won't have any trouble selling them." He dropped a pair of
silver coins and a copper piece on the counter.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks Max.  By the way, could I buy a ladder?"
</p>

<p>
Max seemed puzzled but he shrugged and pulled out another one.  I
handed it back to Duncan and then paused.
</p>

<p>
"Look, Max...you do realize that I just bought a ladder from you for
half a silver piece, broke it apart, and sold you the pieces for two
silver pieces and a copper, right?"
</p>

<p>
He nodded happily.  "Yes, Your Majesty!  Absolutely proper, too.  A
solid transaction&mdash;I hate the ones who come in and try to haggle
over the prices.  As if a ladder could sell for anything other than
five copper!"  He shook his head in disgust at the absurdity of it
all.
</p>

<p>
"But Max, you lost money on the deal," I pointed out, practically
pleading with him to somehow be the first person in Stupidworld to
show some common sense so that I could be sure I wasn't actually the
insane one.  "This was not a good deal for you, Max.  You just paid me
one and a half silver to break one of your ladders."
</p>

<p>
He looked affronted.  "I did no such thing!  I sold you a perfectly
good ladder.  What you choose to do with it once you own it is your
business.  I'm afraid I have a strict 'no refunds' policy, so I can't
return your money just because you broke your ladder."
</p>

<p>
I coughed.  Really.  It was definitely a cough, and anyone who says
that it was a whimper is a dirty lying liar.  Manly men such as myself
do not whimper.  It was a cough.
</p>

<p>
I tried one last time.  "Max, you seem like a smart guy.  You know I'm
just going to do this over and over, sucking money out of you each
time.  You know that, right?  Please say you know that."
</p>

<p>
He seemed confused.  "Um...I know that?"  He paused, looking like a
Golden Retriever who doesn't quite understand what you want but is
desperately eager to give it to you, whatever it might be.  "I'm sorry
Your Majesty, I'm not sure I see the problem...do you want me to not
sell to you?  Or...did you want me to break the ladder before I sell
it to you?  I'm not sure what you want a broken ladder for, but I can
do that if it'll help."
</p>

<p>
I coughed again.  (Yes, I'm sure it was a cough!  Shut up.)
</p>

<p>
"Fine," I said, giving up.  Everyone else in the store&mdash;Thomas,
Duncan, Robert, Rob, Bob, Aerith, Franklin, Suze, and that random
couple in the corner who were waiting to buy some blankets&mdash;were
all staring at me, wondering what this craziness was that I was
spouting, and was it possibly contagious and, if so, how could they be
sure not to get any of the crazy on them.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, Max," I said, resigned to my fate.  "I'd like to buy a ladder.
And, coincidentally, I would also like to sell you a couple of ten
foot poles and some firewood."
</p>

<p>
A few very annoying hours later, I had several wagons loaded down with
one of everything on the normal equipment lists and a
holy-god-that's-a-crapton of a few oddities.  (Who knew that a
medieval world would sell rubber balls?  I loved those things as a
kid, so I picked up twenty million of them.) The wagons had also been
purchased from Max, which made me want to tear my hair out because
they were three times wider than the door to the back of his shop, and
yet he had brought them to me from the back of his shop.  This world
just made me want to cry.
</p>

<p>
I also had a ton of silver pieces kicking around.  No, really&mdash;I
had well over two thousand pounds of silver spilling off the counter
and all around the room.  We were literally standing up to our ankles
in silver coins.  At some point we had started changing it into
platinum, just to reduce the load, but we hadn't finished the process
yet.  Franklin was still busy with the exchanges.
</p>

<p>
With the purchasing done, I stuck my head out the door of Max's shop
and bellowed, "Oy!  I need to hire someone to cast a fourth level
cleric spell!"  I was honestly hoping not to get a response, but some
sick part of me needed to check.
</p>

<p>
"How may I help you, Your Majesty?" said the elegantly dressed woman
who had just stepped around the side of Max's shop in response to my
call.
</p>

<p>
I eyed her in distaste.  Not distaste with her personally; I'm sure
she was a lovely person, and she was attractive enough&mdash;the long
raven-black hair and white robes made her look like a figurine brought
to life.  Probably a small lead figurine that had been sold in a
plastic package with "Dungeons and Dragons Cleric, Human, Female"
plastered across it.  Again, it wasn't distaste for her personally,
but for the insanity she represented; this world was just annoying me
more and more as time went on.  This is not how hiring someone to
demolish the laws of physics should work, damnit!
</p>

<p>
"And you would be...?" I inquired with a tired sigh.
</p>

<p>
"Arianna, seventh level cleric of the True God, Your Majesty," she
said with the fixed smile of an experienced salesperson.
</p>

<p>
"Right.  Pleasure to meet you, Arianna.  Let's start with something
simple.  I need you to cast Soften Earth and Stone on that big chunk
of rock over there."  I waved absently at the four foot high granite
eagle statue that the Landguard had lugged along with us from the
castle.  Why was there a four foot high granite statue of an eagle in
the third floor north guest room of the castle, you might ask? Well,
where else would it be?  I mean, it's not like you can put a four foot
high granite statue of an eagle in the third floor <em>south</em>
guest room, now is it?
</p>

<p>
She frowned in puzzlement.  "Your Majesty, you said you needed someone
to cast a fourth level spell.  Soften Earth and Stone is second level;
I'm afraid I can't help you."
</p>

<p>
I gaped at her, torn between irritation and joy.  On the one hand, my
cunning plan was foiled.  On the other hand, yay!  A tiny little trace
of common sense at long last!  She didn't actually have every single
spell handily available, hurrah!
</p>

<p>
"Um, M'Lord," Suze put in quietly, using the simpler title that I'd
ordered her to stick with.  "I could hire someone else for you, if you
like...?"
</p>

<p>
"Huh?" I said, blinking as I was jarred out of my conflicting
thoughts.  "What?"
</p>

<p>
She apparently decided to accept that as an order, because she turned
to the marketplace that bustled in front of Merchant Max's Marvelous
Market.  "Excuse me, we'd like to hire someone to cast Soften Earth
and Stone, please," she called in a clear soprano that didn't waver at
all.  Apparently the nervousness was just around me and the Landguard.
And maybe the nobles, now that I thought about it.  Although she was
finally starting to get over it, which was good.
</p>

<p>
No less than five separate men came hustling up, all elbowing each
other out of the way in their rush to be the first to get to the
paying customers.
</p>

<p>
"I'm Trevor, Your Majesty," said the wiry little ginger who finally
won the pushing match.  "I can absolutely do Soften Earth and Stone
for you!" I nodded acceptance and he turned to face the statue.
"Soften Earth and&mdash;oh, wait."  His face fell.
</p>

<p>
The world lurched as I saw the problem; I felt like an absolute idiot.
I had remembered from my real-world D&D experience that Soften Earth
and Stone would turn rock into clay, and had been remarkably pleased
at remembering this.  After all, it wasn't like I could just, oh I
don't know, <em>buy</em> some clay, now was it?  After all, it didn't
appear in the equipment lists so naturally it wasn't for sale. (I had
coughed repeatedly when I realized this.)
</p>

<p>
In my satisfaction at my own cleverness, however, I had not taken the
time to check the Brainopedia for the exact details on Soften Earth
and Stone.  Nor had I told any of the Landguard why I was having them
lug the statue along.  Had I bothered to do either of those things, I
would have found out that Soften Earth and Stone doesn't
affect <em>worked</em> stone...such as a statue.
</p>

<p>
I sagged in place and felt my eyes starting to leak; I turned away
from the so-helpful cleric and the stalwart bloody Landguard,
pretending to rub my temples.  It was just too much.  Too much of this
stupid world, and being constantly threatened and having to hurt
people to make them work with me and killing tens of thousands of
people and having my brain turned inside out so that I became a
psychotic mass murdering bastard&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Calm Emotions," Bob murmured, and suddenly I felt fine.  I wiped the
tears away and turned back to face Trevor.
</p>

<p>
"Right, we'll need to get a separate rock in here before you can
transfigure it.  Franklin, why don't you and Rob&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Suze tugged on my sleeve.  "M'Lord," she whispered.  "How much clay do
you need?"
</p>

<p>
I looked at her in surprise.  "Uh...a lot, why?"
</p>

<p>
"Would a thousand pounds be enough, M'Lord?" she asked earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"Um...yes?" I responded in confusion.
</p>

<p>
She gave a wide, happy smile, and marched back into Max's.
</p>

<p>
I watched her go in confusion and looked at Thomas.  He shrugged.  I
looked at Robert.  He shrugged.  "No idea, Your Majesty."
</p>

<p>
I gestured for the various clerics to wait there, then hustled to
catch up with Suze.  The Landguard trailed along in my wake like
ducklings following their mother.  Confused ducklings.
</p>

<p>
I walked through the door just in time to hear Suze say to Max.
"Hello, I'd like to buy the components for a clay golem, please."  She
dropped several large bags of platinum onto the counter with a heavy
'thunk!'
</p>

<p>
Max's face creased into a giant smile as he swept the bags off the
counter and down out of sight into what I was starting to believe was
either a white hole or a Drexlerian cornucopia machine.  "No problem!
Here you are."  He reached under the counter and hefted a giant block
of wet clay&mdash;a little under a yard on a side, and easily a
thousand pounds&mdash;onto the counter.  Reaching back down he pulled
out several bottles of rare oils and a few bags of powder.  Those were
set down gently beside the clay.
</p>

<p>
I just stared.  I was pretty sure that Max was a normal human without
magical enhancements, so how in the name of all that's holy was he
able to lift a half a ton of clay onto the counter?!
</p>

<p>
"Um...could you load that into the wagon for us, Max?" I inquired
weakly.
</p>

<p>
He looked at me like I was crazy.  "Sorry, Your Majesty, there's no
way I could lift it.  If you give me a few hours, I can hire some
people to deliver it for you."
</p>

<p>
"But...you just put it on the counter...?" I whined.
</p>

<p>
He looked puzzled.  "I just sold it to you, Your Majesty.  I'm afraid
you'll need to arrange delivery yourself."
</p>

<p>
Bob stepped forward, set his feet, and dug his hands into the clay.
"No problem, Your Majesty, I got it."  With a grunt, he straightened
up, hauling the immense weight with him.  "Could you get the door for
me?"
</p>

<p>
Abandoning my last shreds of manliness, I whimpered as I got the door.
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
"Ok, Arianna.  I want to buy a hundred thousand fourth level cleric
spells.  Elmer," I said, turning to the wizard who had hustled up when
I called for another caster. (Also, Elmer the Wizard?  Really?  God, I
hated this world.)  "I want to buy a million third level wizard
spells, and I need them all cast in just a few hours, so you'll need
to go get a bunch of friends.  Standard rates?"
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely!" Arianna told me with a beatific smile.  "No trouble,
Your Majesty," echoed Elmer.
</p>

<p>
I rubbed my temples.  "You know there's no possible way there are that
many level-appropriate casters in this city, right?"
</p>

<p>
They both looked at me in bafflement and started to say
something&mdash;probably something along the lines of 'Why should
common sense or sanity or the laws of physics and scarcity apply when
the unbelievably stupid Rules say that you can hire NPCs to cast for
you but don't say anything about availability aside from how big the
city has to be in order to find a mage of a particular level?'  I
waved them both quiet before they could damage my calm any further.
"Never mind.  Let's just get to the casting."
</p>

<p>
<strong>"Ahem,"</strong> said the god who had just shimmered into
existence in front of me.
</p>

<p>
"<em>What?!</em>" I yelled at him.  "What do you want this time?  For
the love of Pete, you're the ones who made the rules, I'm just working
with them!  I can't help it if you made unbelievably broken insane
stupid-ass crazy bogus insane rules that are utterly insane!  What
is <em>wrong</em> with you people?  Can't you recognize the craziness?
Please, recognize the craziness!"  By the end of my rant, I was
practically pleading with him.
</p>

<p>
He looked at me in disbelief, then started snickering.  The snickers
turned to guffaws.  The guffaws turned to cackles.  The cackling went
on.  And on.  And on.
</p>

<p>
After a while it started to calm down.  "Hang on," he said, still
snickering as he wiped the tears away.  He waved at me with a 'Give me
a minute' gesture while trying, without much success, to get control
of himself.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, he managed to put a lid on the laughter, wipe his eyes
clear, and turn to face me.  Only to promptly crack up again as he met
my impatient, fulminating glare.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, ok, I got this," he gasped out. "One sec."  The last of the
laughter faded into chuckles, then to giggles, then finally stopped.
"Whew," he sighed, massaging his face where, apparently, his cheeks
were aching from laughing so hard.  "Man, no one's made me laugh that
hard in centuries.  Can't remember the last time a mortal actually
snapped at me; hilarious. Ok, now...let's see, where was I?  Ah,
right."
</p>

<p>
He swelled to a towering forty foot height; lightning danced around
his white robes and thunder boomed behind him as the very air
shimmered with arcane power.  "<strong>Jacob of Earth, self-styled
Emperor, thou has transgressed the bounds allowed to mortals!  So
sayeth Arros, God of Magic!  Thou shalt cease this behavior upon the
instant, or thou Shalt. Suffer. My.  Wraaaaatttthhhhhh!</strong>" The
last word echoed and reverbed, rolling across the open plaza around us
and out into the city.  The various passerby were on their knees,
faces pressed to the ground in fear.  Suze was clutching tight to the
back of Duncan's harness, keeping him carefully between her and the
god.  The other Landguard were staring around at each other in
puzzlement&mdash;not only was the normal divine awe-inspiring-aura not
overwhelming them, but they were actually being allowed to be present
instead of being frozen in time like all of my previous visits from
divinities.
</p>

<p>
"How was that?" Arros asked in curiosity, shrinking to a normal
conversational size.  He combed his fingers through his long white
beard, an interested look on his wrinkled face as he waited for my
response.  "Was it impressive?  I always thought it was cheating to
use the whole 'divine aura' thing, so I've been taking oratory lessons
from Mika&mdash;she's the goddess of bards, you know, so I figured
she'd be the best choice.  Anyway, what did you think?"
</p>

<p>
I paused, nonplussed.  "Um...yes?  Very impressive?  Ah...yes.  Had a
kind of epic poetry to it.  Didn't it have epic poetry to it, Thomas?"
</p>

<p>
He nodded solemnly.  "Definitely.  Highly inspiring, Your Majesty."
</p>

<p>
Arros beamed.  "Excellent!  I'm so glad.  Anyway, right, to business."
He looked around at Elmer, Arianna, and the others and flapped his
hands at them like a farmwife shooing chickens.  "Vamoose, you lot.
Go get a beer or something, I need to talk with Jake here."  The whole
group  of them nodded jerkily, turned, and hurried away.
</p>

<p>
"Have a seat, Jake," he said, settling onto one of the stools around
the long bar he had just conjured out of thin air.  "What are you
drinking?"
</p>

<p>
It took me a minute to get my mouth working again.  My initial anger
and frustration had worn off and without the fury to buoy me up I was
feeling pretty shaken.  I wished that Bob's Calm Emotions spell was
still in effect, because I could really use some calm about now.
</p>

<p>
"Um...Scotch?" I asked hopefully.  I was a massive lightweight, so I
didn't usually drink much.  Despite that, I felt that the
circumstances probably called for something stronger than beer.
</p>

<p>
Arros pulled a crystal decanter of Cire Perdue&mdash;a 64-year-old
Macallan, the best Scotch in the world&mdash;out of his sleeve and
poured it into an elegant cut crystal goblet before passing it to me.
He kept pouring&mdash;the level in the bottle never seemed to go down,
and new goblets kept coming out of his sleeves, from behind his ears,
from in his beard, and from thin air.  He slid each goblet down the bar
to one of the Landguard, and finally to Suze, until everyone was
served.
</p>

<p>
"Um...Commander, we're on duty...?" muttered Rob.  Thomas waved
permission at him; if there was ever a time to <em>not</em> refuse
someone's hospitality, this was it.
</p>

<p>
Arros took a hefty slug of his Scotch and looked pleasantly surprised;
his eyebrows went up as he studied the bottle.  "This is great
stuff. Your world really knows how to brew booze."
</p>

<p>
"Ah...thanks?" I offered weakly, carefully not pointing out that one
does not 'brew' Scotch.  
</p>

<p>
He shrugged and set his goblet down.  "Anyway, to business.  Here's
the thing: Shailos's Edict forbids mortals from, among other things,
doing infinite loops.  We don't care too much about fussy little
things like infinite money&mdash;the Edict is mostly intended to
prevent mortals from acquiring sufficient power to ascend."  He took a
deep slug of his whiskey and smacked his lips in satisfaction.  "Damn,
that's amazing.  Anyway, buying ridiculous numbers of spells is
something of a gray area...it's not infinite, but it's still pretty
frowned upon.  Personally, I think it's a stupid thing to get annoyed
about, but those are the rules."  He took another sip, his eyes
falling closed in bliss.
</p>

<p>
I took a cautious sip of my own glass and blinked in amazement as it
introduced itself to my tongue.  Deep as the ocean, rich as Croesus,
only very slightly peaty; a base flavor of dark, creamy chocolate with
a heavy overlay of oak and just a hint of fruit to balance it out.
</p>

<p>
Essentially, it was Nirvana in a glass.  I took another sip, chewing
to fully release the flavor.  The mellow intensity of it gently set
fire to my tongue even as the aromatics made sweet, sweet love to my
palate.  Tasting this perfect nectar was like spending an evening with
the buxom female love child of Marilyn Monroe, Einstein, and Monet
while unicorns gamboled in the emerald grass around me, their flowing
manes shimmering in the light of the fireworks and rainbows overhead.
</p>

<p>
Unable to help myself, I slammed my glass back and reached for the
bottle to pour myself another.  The luscious, lustrous deliciousness
flowed smoothly down my throat and lit a warm, toasty campfire in my
belly.  I'm pretty sure that adorable baby otters were cooking s'mores
over that fire.
</p>

<p>
"Ok..." I began cautiously.  I took another sip of the Macallan and
breathed out a sigh of satisfaction.  "So, where are we?  Are you
going to let me do this or not?"
</p>

<p>
Arros shrugged.  "Sure.  In fact, I'll throw the spells for you.  I'm
totally onboard with what you're doing and why; Neklos and his faction
have always pissed me off and they've gotten way worse since all this
mess started over in Anundj&aring;.  In the future though, try not to
buy more than, say, a hundred spells at a time?"
</p>

<p>
I carefully kept my face straight.  "Absolutely.  No more than a
hundred at a time, got it."
</p>

<p>
He gave me a squinty-eyed look.  "Make that a hundred a <em>day</em>.
Otherwise I know you'll just be buying a hundred, then immediately
buying another hundred.  And if you're buying them anywhere smaller
than Capital City, keep it proportional to the population.  Half a
million people, no more than fifty spells a day, and so on.  Got it?"
</p>

<p>
I grimaced; he'd seen right through me.  "Ok, fine.  I won't buy more
than a hundred a day, and I'll keep it proportional, I promise."  I
sighed.  It had been such a beautiful plan.
</p>

<p>
He grinned and waved a hand.  Reality flickered around me like a
glitch in the Matrix; after the flicker he was in a slightly different
position and his glass was empty.  "There you go.  I also packaged
them up for you, and had one of my team come in to do the cleric
spells.  You're all set."
</p>

<p>
I looked back at the nearest wagon; the original contents were gone,
replaced with a stack of what looked like telephone poles, all covered
in heavy tarps.
</p>

<p>
He stood up, patting down the pockets of his robe like he was checking
that he had his keys and wallet.  Nodding in satisfaction, he waved and faded
away.
</p>

<p>
I stared at where he'd been for a moment and stood up.  As soon as we
were all on our feet, the bar and stools vanished.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, one last thing&mdash;" Arros said, shimmering back into
existence.  "You can keep the bottle."  He pressed the container of
perfection into my hands and vanished again.  I clutched it tightly to
my chest, eyes shining in delight.
</p>

<p>
  <center><em><strong>~= now =~</strong></em></center>
</p>

<p>
"What's causing those explosions?" Albrecht asked curiously.
</p>

<p>
"Robert," I responded.  "The ammo is eighty rubber balls wrapped up in
clay and baked in a Permanencied Wall of Fire spell.  We put fifty
Celestial Brilliance spells on each of the clay cylinders; since the
balls are inside it, they are affected too.  When the cylinder hits
the ground it shatters and the rubber balls scatter everywhere.  Each
of the balls has Explosive Runes on it.  Robert is Greater
Invisibilied and Flying over the battlefield with Eyes of the Eagle
and a telescope.  Whenever a bunch of the balls come to rest he looks
down, reads the Runes on one of them, and the explosion blows them
back into motion."  I shrugged.  "It also tends to destroy a few of
the balls, but the ones that survive continue doing damage."
</p>

<p>
I nodded to Colborn, emphasizing that I was making an important point.
"I said we could each choose three people.  You didn't bother choosing
any; you're about to see what me and my 'meatshields' can do."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, very amusing I'm sure," Colborn sneered.  "Can we get on
with this? You obviously just cheated, so you lose the bet."
</p>

<p>
My eyebrows shot up in feigned dismay.  "Cheated?  You slur my honor,
sir!  How have I cheated?"  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw
Albrecht fighting to restrain a smile.  He knew exactly where this was
going.  
</p>

<p>
"You cast Launch Object on your toy over there," he said, gesturing to
the cannon.  "And you cast Celestial Brilliance on the ammunition.
Obviously.  The deal was that none of you would cast any spells, so
you cheated and you lose."  He turned to Albrecht with a satisfied
look on his face, withdrawing a folded piece of paper from his robes.
"Now, I've got the list of which magi and which meatshields I'll be
taking with me.  We'll load provisions tomorrow and leave first light
the next day.  I'll try to send reports back periodically and I'll
tell you where to attack.  Don't contact us, as the Sendings could
potentially arrive at an inconvenient moment and blow our cover if
we're sneaking."
</p>

<p>
I laughed.  "I said that <em>neither I nor my three-man team</em>
would cast any spells.  We didn't&mdash;Arros and his teammate cast
the Explosive Runes and Celestial Brilliance spells.  Jary
here"&mdash;the young mage shrank back as all eyes turned to
him&mdash;"cast the Fly and Invisibility spells.  The four
of <em>us</em> didn't cast a darn thing."
</p>

<p>
He gave me a fulminiating glare which I thoroughly ignored.  Instead
of saying anything further, I just paced over to Thomas and climbed up
on his back, piggyback style.  Looking over my shoulder at Albrecht
and Colborn I announced.  "Albrecht, let us know when time is up, ok?"
The pudgy little general nodded, his face practically radiating
curiousity.
</p>

<p>
I turned to Colborn to put the capstone on things.  "Remember I said
there were some other differences between us?  Well, one of the more
important ones is that y'all are only allowed to say one command word
every six seconds, but I can talk as fast as I want."  I tapped my
heels against Thomas's sides and shouted, "Go!"
</p>

<p>
Thomas took off, running like greased lightning past the rows of
cannon.  He carefully stayed hunched over so as to keep his (and my!)
head below the barrel openings.  Duncan came a few yards behind us,
his phone poles stuck out to the sides so that they passed over the
troughs on the barrels.
</p>

<p>
It was an intricate ballet, and we had had only a few hours to
practice, but they pulled it off flawlessly.  As we went I was
bellowing "Fire Shrink Fire Shrink Fire Shrink Fire Shrink Fire Shrink
Fire Shrink Fire Shrink Fire Shrink!" as fast as I could and at the
top of my lungs.  Every time I said 'Fire', all cannon within ten feet
blasted their brightly shining ammo out over the valley below us.
Every time I said 'Shrink', all of those firing rods contracted back
to their ready state.  
</p>

<p>
Of course, the great weakness of cannon is that it takes time to
reload them.  This is where I was beating on Stupidworld's rules like
a speed bag at a boxing gym.  The columns that Duncan was carrying
were essentially giant rifle cartridges, each one containing eighty
rounds of ammunition stacked vertically.  He held the column over the
cut-away barrels; every time the cannon reset he would drop the next
ammo load out of the appropriate column and into the barrel's trough.
The steady 'thwang!' of the firing rods clashing off the backplates of
the cannon and the flashbang-bright light that surrounded each of
those ammo cannisters made for an almost unbearable sensory overload,
but Thomas and Duncan kept it together.
</p>

<p>
There was no way on Earth that this would have worked...or, rather,
there was no way that this would have worked on Earth.  But we weren't
on Earth, and Stupidworld played by entirely different rules.  Here,
you could run forwards, backwards, or sideways at your full speed.
Dropping things was a free action, so Duncan could drop a hundred
cannisters of ammo over the course of a round as easily as one, and
given Duncan's Dexterity score, each ammo cannister always fell right
into the trough of a cannon, ready to be fired.
</p>

<p>
It was totally nuts, but it worked.
</p>

<p>
When the two of them got to the end of their run, Duncan dropped the
expended ammo cartridges and pulled the next two into position, one in
each hand.  The two of them pivoted on a dime and started back through
on another sweep.  Picking the ammo up would have taken a move action,
meaning that Duncan would have had to move normally instead of running
that round, but he didn't have to pick them up&mdash;he was already
carrying them and so just had to reposition them in his inventory.  We
were firing off eighty cannon every six seconds, each of which threw
around eighty undead-vaporizing rubber balls on a slightly different
trajectory out over the seething horde of undead below.  The balls
were awesome enough that I had decided they needed their own special
title.  I had debated calling them "Emperor's balls" but decided that
was maybe a little inappropriate.  On further thought, I decided that
they should be named for the ruler of Venice instead of the ruler of
Flobovia.  Thus were born the Doge-balls.  (Bum dum tish!)
</p>

<p>
"Time!" shouted Albrecht.  Immediately, Thomas and Duncan dropped
their cartridges and raced rapidly up to the crest of the hill where
Albrecht and Colborn stood so that we could see the effects of the
shoot.
</p>

<p>
I glanced at Colborn and then turned back to Albrecht with a
tight-lipped smile. "So, do you think we killed more than sixty-two
thousand?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht stared down at the virtually depopulated valley below us in
wonder.  "Oh my, yes," he whispered in a voice filled with awe.

<em>The blurb for "One Hot Night" is:</em>
</p>
<p>
"In a society without death, Ingfred is 20 years old and has no
prospects. All the good jobs are filled by undying masters of their
craft, and it's hard to be taken seriously when you are, compared to
everyone around you, an infant.  Fortunately, he has a solution:
undergo an illegal transformation and sell the memory to The
Experiental Herald for a ridiculous sum.
</p>

<p>
There's two problems: how can Ingfred convince a powerful wizard to
risk his mage license and his freedom to help with such a crazy plan?
And, once that's done...how will Ingfred deal with the aftermath?"
