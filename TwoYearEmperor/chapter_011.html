</p>

<hr />

<p>Everyone wonders and worries about death.  What will it be like?
Will there be pearly gates?  Will my friends and loved ones be
there?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>No, they will not.</p>

<p>When a Fireball hits you, and you are a middle-aged programmer
instead of an 18th level avatar of the God of Truth, Justice, and
Butt-Kicking...you die.  Your skin cracks, blackens, sizzles, and
peels away like badly applied paint.  The fire sears your lungs,
flaying you from the inside out.  Your hair crisps away, your eyes
boil.  And worse than any of the pain is the searing flash of
realization that your life mattered not at all.  That in a few years
anyone who remembers you will have moved on and, if they do happen to
think of you, you'll be nothing more than a brief twinge of nostalgia,
easily drowned out by the need to make a grocery list.  And that's the
last thought that you have before you wink out.
</p>

<p>Everything that you were, everything that you hoped for or dreamed
of&mdash;it all gets erased as casually as someone tossing a used
Kleenex.  You have no further chance to learn guitar, travel to
Europe, finish your degree, or tell that one girl how much you love
her. It's all gone, and there's nothing left.  There's no eternal
blackness, no white light and choir of angels, not even a pit of fire
and brimstone.  Those things would all be preferable; at least your
mind would still exist.  You would still be you, still have the chance
to think and plan and dream of escape, no matter how unlikely the
chances.  But there is simply non-existence.
</p>

<p>Instead of ascending to heaven, you lie in the dirt.  And you rot.</p>
