<em><strong>Author's Note</strong>:  Still don't own D&D.</em>
</p>


<hr />

<p>
"You don't have barrels?  You're kidding, right?"  We were back in the
War Room, once again alone, and I was busy being gobsmacked at the
absence of a simple material object that meant my latest and greatest
tactical brilliance was a nonstarter.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht looked at me with the patient expression that one would use
on a child who was being naive and pesky.  "No, we don't have barrels.
The people of Gr&#491;fhamr are <em>refugees</em>, Jake; we came here
with what we could carry on our backs and in a few Portable Holes that
were snatched up on the run."
</p>

<p>
I raised my hands in surrender.  "Ok, but we can just buy them from
one of your shops, right?  That whole broken economics thing works in
Anundj&aring; just like in Flobovia?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht's patient look flickered into irritation but was almost
instantly smoothed over into 'diplomat face' and a smile.  "There are
no shops in Gr&#491;fhamr, Jake.  None of the merchants we rescued
were able to bring their shop with them, and without some way to
acquire stock they couldn't restart them."
</p>

<p>
"Oh." I replied.  I thought about that for a minute. "Well, we could
teleport to Flobovia and buy things there, right?  In fact, we could
probably buy enough stock that you could start a store here, and then
you'd have all the goods you need."
</p>

<p>
The face stayed carefully blank and the smile never flickered.  "Money
isn't a great priority when fleeing for one's life, Jake.  Gold coins
are heavy; most people grabbed food and weapons.  And now that we've
become part of Flobovia, I've returned all the plunder that we took in
the initial invasion and I'm not about to raid for the supplies we
desperately need.  After all, that would be treasonous."  The last was
spoken in tones of such heavy irony that I very carefully chose not to
acknowledge the topic at all.
</p>

<p>
Instead, I briefly outlined the ways in which the Flobovian (and,
presumably, Anundj&aring;n) economic system were borked and could be
ruthlessly exploited, thereby putting money in the "it ain't even a
thing" category.
</p>

<p>
As I talked, Albrecht's eyebrows climbed higher and higher until I
thought they were going to need an oxygen tank.  "My god, I think that
would work," he murmured in amazement.  He paused for a long moment
and got a faroff look.  "We could have enough weapons, enough armor,
and decent food.  No more created protein glop.  <em>Everyone</em>
could eat well, for every meal.  My god."  His voice was filled with
pure wonder.
</p>

<p>
I smiled; I might not do strategy terribly well, but I could make the
rules of this world roll over and beg for mercy.  From what I had
gleaned, the people who lived here had grown up with those rules and,
accepting them as normal, had never searched for exploits.  Having an
outside view gave me an enormous advantage.
</p>

<p>
That thought sparked another.  My outside view was, in large part,
derived from my otherworldly knowledge of D&D as a game and the rules
thereof.  (Well, that and a whole lot of ideas and exploits bandied
about on the Internet, but that was neither here nor there.)  If I was
weak on strategy, then I needed a book on strategy from Earth.  The
obvious choice was "The Art of War"; I had, in point of fact, read it,
but it had been a long time ago.  I reached back into my memory for
the text.
</p>

<p>
I came up empty.  I could remember fragments of it, but I couldn't
bring to mind the full details.  I frowned; my memory had been
flawless ever since the intelligence boosts, what was the problem?
</p>

<p>
A moment's thought gave me the likely answer: the memories I had
called to mind before now were either very recent (the taste of the
cheese I had after arriving here) or very personally important
(memories of childhood and family).  "The Art of War" was neither of
those things.  Apparently, I didn't suddenly have an eidetic memory,
it was just that my brain was more richly connected and therefore had
more routes to reach things that were relatively easily accessible.
</p>

<p>
Maybe they are normal for a guy my age, but performance problems are
<em>so</em> embarrassing.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, assume that that solves the supply problem," I said, shelving the
idea for future consideration and and returning to proximate issues.
"Let's get back to the undead; I can think of lots of ways to kill
them with minimal risk to us.  What's your strategy and how do I best
fit into it tactically?"
</p>

<p>
"The ideal action would be a decapitation strike," Albrecht stated
without hesitation.  "Eliminate the Lich Kings&mdash;especially
Afi&mdash;and leave the enemy leaderless.  If they lacked overall
command we could separate them and defeat them in detail.  It would
take a long time, but I'm confident it could be done; the wights are
easy to kill, it's the incorporeals&mdash;wraiths, shadows, ghosts,
what have you&mdash;that are a problem, but even there we could do it
if we were careful."
</p>

<p>
He paused for a moment, lost in his thoughts.  "Killing the liches is
pretty unlikely though.  Next best would be to take out some of their
strongest casters.  My grandnephew, Colborn L&ouml;fgren&mdash;he'd be
an excellent target.  A Fourth Circle Master High Mage, focus in
battlemagic; now he's a vampire and he spends most of his time hunting
us.  No strategic sense, but an expert tactician with a good sense of
who and what to target.  He served under me in the Dwarf War; I would
assign an undercommander to get him to the battle and then turn him
loose.  He was also an expert at tracking insurgents, so he's a major
problem for us.  Five of our last sixteen times moving Gr&#491;fhamr,
it's because he tracked us down."
</p>

<p>
He started pacing, hands clasped behind his back in thought.  The room
wasn't really big enough for pacing, so it was more a question of
step-step-turn than real pacing.  "Then, of course, there's Astrid.  I
mentioned her earlier; expert biomage.  Some of the creatures she's
developed as infiltrators and spies have been a real problem.  There
are others; High Mage Calder, expert diviner.  Hertha Knutsen; High
Cleric, focus on weather magic.  Kelby Hjort; generalist mage and
explorer.  He knows far too many of the good hiding places in this
country."
</p>

<p>
He stopped pacing and turned to face us; the hands came out from
behind his back in a shrug.  "The list goes on.  Almost all of our top
magi and clerics; literally millions of casters more powerful than
anything Flobovia has ever seen.  They represent too much of a
strategic and tactical advantage for the drauga; we can't afford to
engage the enemy in battle unless we can be sure of wiping the targets
out in the initial attack, before a Sending can be sent out.
Otherwise, a party of High Magi and High Priests will teleport in and
we're all dead.  It's a problem; I'd like to be level grinding our
people with small engagements, but we simply can't take the risk."
</p>

<p>
I shrugged.  "Ok, well, killing these guys off ain't really a thing.
We get within a few miles of them and use an antimatter strike to blow
them all off the map from way outside any range they could sense us
at.  Let's do the Liches first; you said they were the most important.
Do we know where any of them are?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas shook his head.  "Not as easy as that, I'm afraid.  Liches have
phylacteries; usually more than one.  When a lich is destroyed, it
reforms from its phylactery.  And the phylacteries are always
ridiculously well hidden."  He paused, then clearly decided to finish
his thought.  "Also, I don't think blowing up all our highest level
magi is a good idea."
</p>

<p>
I grunted in disgust.  "First off, I know how to do it without the
mage dying.  Second, that phylactery thing is ginormously annoying,
and someone who isn't me should figure out how to stop it from
happening. But, ok, leave that aside for a minute.  Albrecht, will
destroying craptons of junior undead help?  Maybe we wipe out a bunch
of minions, wait for some of your big names to teleport in, then
wipe <em>them</em> out with an antimatter blast?  We could probably
honey trap a lot of them that way, with minimal risk."
</p>

<p>
He nodded and grimaced simultaneously.  "It might work, but the
incorporeals will be immune to your 'antimatter explosion' attacks; no
non-magical attack can hurt them.  Because of that, there's a good
chance that any of the casters teleporting in would arrive in an
incorporeal form, just as insurance."
</p>

<p>
I chuckled.  "That's ok, I've got plenty of ideas for magical attacks.
So, tell me O Mighty Master of Military Mayhem: assuming that I can
blow the crap out of the bad guys&mdash;because, you know, I totally
can&mdash;where and when do I get to do it?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht eyed me for a moment.  "The first thing we need to do is get
a shop set up in Gr&#491;fhamr so we can get the physical
things&mdash;especially food&mdash;that we need.  The morale and
spirit of the army is the single greatest factor in war; without it,
no army can succeed.  The conditions in Gr&#491;fhamr, and of the war
in general, have seriously sapped the troops' spirits, which is the
other half of why I haven't been willing to take them out to fight."
</p>

<p>
Thomas and I both raised an eyebrow at that. "You seemed to be doing
fine when you butchered Oxport and Tor Canle," Thomas contended in a
voice made of glaciers and knives.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht shrugged, his mind clearly elsewhere.  "That was different.
The troops knew that they weren't going to be fighting overwhelmingly
powerful drauga casters and they <em>were</em> going to be fighting
for a place to live that was far more comfortable than here&mdash;a
place for themselves and their families both.  I had my pick of
volunteers for that.  If I had to lead a force against the drauga
there are <em>maybe</em> a thousand that I would be willing to trust,
out of well over a million troops under arms."
</p>

<p>
Thomas was starting to seethe at the casual dismissal of Tor Canle and
Oxport, so I stepped in hastily before this could devolve into another
poky-object-in-place-where-poky-object-should-not-be conversation.
"Ok, so getting a shop set up is first priority. How many of the
Flobovian magi that we brought with us made it here?  Most of them are
higher level, so their Rope Tricks will last long enough to help
relieve some of the crowding."
</p>

<p>
"About four hundred," Albrecht responded, gratefully turning away from
Thomas's thunderous expression.  "We've put them on making living
space and cleanup duty.  They aren't happy about it, but they haven't
actively started trouble yet."
</p>

<p>
"Ok, good," I responded, satisfied that things were mostly working
out.  "So, we get the store set up; that means everyone can eat decent
food again, which should help a lot.  After that, we kill off the Lich
Kings&mdash;even if it's only at least temporary it buys us some time
while the enemy is leaderless.  During that time, we wipe out tons and
tons of drauga, just to whittle their numbers down.  That last part
should be easy enough&mdash;we find a big group of them, set off an
antimatter explosion that vaporizes every undead within miles, then we
move on to the next group and do it again.  Sounds like a plan."  I
nodded decisively, pleased at this handy summation and the clearcut
action plan it entailed.  "Yep, easy peasy."
</p>

<p>
I should have known better.  Calling anything about this situation
"easy peasy" was a bit like blowing a raspberry at Murphy while
mooning him and saying that his father smelt of elderberries. 
</p>

<p>
"Not a good idea," Albrecht insisted.  "Those antimatter explosions of
yours are too powerful&mdash;they chew up large portions of the
landscape.  Too much of that and one of the gods of land, river,
forest, or so on will show up to object."
</p>

<p>
I groaned.  "Damnit, you and your freakin' gods.  <em>Fine!</em>" I
started pondering the feasibility of airbursts, but quickly rejected
the idea.  For one thing, it might possibly piss off some god of sky,
or rainclouds, or mosquitoes, or let's-make-Jake-miserable. (Because
there was <em>clearly</em> a god specially devoted to that!)  For
another, it would be too tricky to calculate the height where we would
catch a good number of undead in the explosion while not damaging the
landscape too much.  I was pretty sure that radiation wasn't going to
affect the undead, so only the fireball and shockwave would matter.
That meant we needed to get the fireball up close and personal.
</p>

<p>
"Hang on," I said, with a sudden surge of hope.  "I've already done
the antimatter thing twice, and no one showed up to smack me.  Doesn't
that mean it's safe?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht shook his head.  "No.  You blew up Herr&uacute;n's temple;
she's not around to object, but her temple was still <em>her
temple</em>, meaning it was outside the purview of any other god.  As
to the mountain...." He shrugged.  "I don't know.  Maybe the earth
goddess and the mountain god were fighting about who got to respond
and never got around to actually responding.  Maybe the mountain god
decided to treat it as a mining effort.  Or maybe he just slept
through it&mdash;it can be hard to get his attention, sometimes.  But
I certainly wouldn't risk it again without better information."
</p>

<p>
"Fine," I grumbled.  "We won't blow them up."  My voice dropped to a
disgruntled mumble as I talked mostly to myself.  "Stupid gods and
their stupid rules about stupid things like not blowing up stupid
undead."  Sighing, I went back to the conversation around me.  "Ok,
well, I can think of plenty of other ways to kill tons of them that
won't involve so much collateral damage."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht cocked his head to the side, thinking about what I was
saying.  Suddenly his eyes got wide and sparkled with manic glee as
his face split open in a smile of clever delight.
</p>

<p>
"I've got a better idea," he began with excitement.  "Thomas, tell me
a little more about the Landguard and their swords...."
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
The falling vampire blocked the light that entered through the
overhead entrance of the Portable Hole; it cast weird shadows on the
Landguard waiting below as it thrashed and struggled to throw off
Guardian Second Jaqueline Marsh.
</p>

<p>
They hit the ground together; Jacqueline gave a grunt as they
impacted, but did not loosen her grip.
</p>

<p>
The vampire had been taken by surprise, but it was no fool; it
realized almost immediately that it could not escape the woman's
enhanced strength.  Instantly, it began to dissolve into a greasy
black mist.  Even before the creature was fully transformed, the mist
was streaming for the surface in a frantic bid for escape.
</p>

<p>
Paladins they might be, but the Landguard had not the slightly
interest in playing fair.  Before the transformation could complete, a
strident <em>bong</em> rang out and all magic ceased, jolting the
creature back to its material form.  Simultaneously, the entrance of
the Hole vanished, the magic portal shut off by the wave of antimagic.
Mentally off balance and confused by the sudden cessation of its
powers, the vampire was too slow to react as it was forced back into
its corporeal form.  The three Landguard descended on it like wolves
on a sick cow, delivering powerful strikes with fists, feet, and
lead-weighted saps.
</p>

<p>
The vampire fought back, but it was confused and weakened by the
antimagic; within moments, it was unconscious on the bottom of the
Hole.
</p>

<p>
Duncan studied it with a practiced eye.  "Kick it a few more times,"
he growled.  "Let's be sure it's not faking."  All three Landguard
gathered around and put the boot in repeatedly until the vampire was
bruised, battered, and most definitely <em>not</em> faking its
unconsciousness.
</p>

<p>
Once he was sure the undead leech was secured, Duncan nodded to the
third member of his team; Guardian First Philip Archer gave a crisp
acknowledgement and tapped his swords together, deactivating their
antimagic.  The opening to the Hole popped back into existence above
them, but only for the instant that it took Jacqueline to reach up and
pull it in after them, sealing them in the extradimensional space.
Against the floor to one side, a small brass pipe resumed sending out
the gentle but steady stream of fresh air which kept the Hole from
becoming a suffocating death trap.
</p>

<p>
Duncan reached into his Handy Haversack and tossed a ridiculously
overdone helm to Philip.  Made of brightly polished silver and shaped
like a giant sea shell, the thing was covered with intricately-tooled
gold inlay, encrusted with a ridiculous number of horribly gaudy gems
(most of them actually semi-precious stones, and not high quality ones
at that), and crowned with a three-foot spray of peacock feathers.  It
was the tackiest magic item any of them had ever seen, almost
eye-searing in its ugliness.  The mage who had crafted it must never
have put any ranks in Knowledge Skill (Good Taste)...and might have
been blind drunk as well.
</p>

<p>
The vampire had been a tall, dark-skinned man with deepset eyes and a
weak chin.  Not terribly handsome to begin with, he looked like a
drunk clown once Jacqueline jammed the helm down on his head.
</p>

<p>
"Detect Evil," muttered Duncan, eying the unconscious monster
critically.  After a moment he shook his head.  "Didn't take; he must
have made his Will save.  Try it again.  And give him a whack while
you're at it; he's healing up."
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline frowned in irritation before yanking the helm off the
vampire's head and immediately jamming it back on.  <em>Ring!</em>
went the helm as Philip booted the monster in the head to keep it
unconscious.
</p>

<p>
Duncan shook his head.  "Nope.  Still didn't work; try it again."
</p>

<p>
The helm got yanked off and slapped on again.  <em>Ring!</em> went the
helm as another kick landed.
</p>

<p>
"Nope." <em>Ring!</em>
</p>

<p>
"Nope."  <em>Ring!</em>
</p>

<p>
"Nope."  <em>Ring!</em>
</p>

<p>
"Nope."  <em>Ring!</em>
</p>

<p>
"Nope."  <em>Ring!</em>
</p>

<p>
"Nope."  <em>Ring!</em>
</p>

<p>
"Got it!  Ok, let him wake up."
</p>

<p>
Moments later, the vampire's eyes blinked open in confusion.  It took
a moment for them to uncross; Philip had kicked him pretty hard, a
lot.  Once he was seeing clearly again, the monster studied the three
warriors standing over it, looking tense and holding their blades in
hand with the easy grip of accomplished masters.  The monster very
carefully did not move while it assessed its situation.
</p>

<p>
"Um...hi?" it ventured.
</p>

<p>
"Welcome back, Master High Mage L&ouml;fgren," Duncan offered in his
trademark growl.  "Your granduncle sends his best."
</p>

<p>
Colborn sat up, rubbing his head gently.  Looking around, he saw the
helm lying next to him and nodded in sudden understanding.
</p>

<p>
"Helm of Opposite Alignment, right?" he wondered.  "That's why I'm
suddenly Lawful Good?  Thanks, by the way."
</p>

<p>
Duncan grunted an acknowledgement.  The two junior Landguard relaxed
and sheathed their swords.
</p>

<p>
"Come on," Duncan said, offering a hand to pull the
still-vampiric-but-no-longer-evil Master High Mage L&ouml;fgren to his
feet.  "Let's get you back to headquarters.  This should be fun."
</p>
