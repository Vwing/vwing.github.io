<em><strong>Author's Note</strong>: Ownership of D&D?  I ain't
claiming that claim.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em><strong>Potential trigger warning:</strong> Thomas starts the
chapter by epically failing to use his words. (i.e., there is
relatively graphic physical violence)</em>
</p>
<hr />

<p>
I screamed as the bones in my elbow were crushed; Thomas's hand pinned
my head to the floor with the strength of a hydraulic press, muffling
the sound to little more than a mumble.
</p>

<p>
"You slaughtered my brothers," Thomas snarled.  He dropped a
hammerfist on my knee, snapping it like a twig.  "You betrayed our
Archmagi to their deaths."  He wrapped his large, sword-calloused hand
around my soft, pale, desk-jockey fingers and squeezed.  I screamed as
the bones shattered.
</p>

<p>
"I feel that you need an object lesson in why this was poor
decision-making," he growled, leaning in close so that I could see the
rage burning in his eyes.  "And after the lesson"&mdash;he dropped
another hammerfist into my side; I mewled in pain as I felt a rib
snap&mdash;"afterwards, I'll heal all this up, because we need you
functional.  I am not going to kill you this time, you pustulent
little maggot."  Another strike, this time to the other side, and
another rib broke.  "Albrecht wants you to help him with the war."  He
hit again, a little higher and once again on the left side; two more
ribs went.  I was screaming and crying, but the sound was almost
inaudible behind his powerful hand.  "Having you work for him&mdash;"
A third strike landed and the remaining ribs on my left side caved in;
I felt bones grinding into my chest.  "Having you working for him will
probably help protect my people.  But by every god,"&mdash;he hit my
chest with a palm strike so powerful I thought my lungs would
collapse&mdash;"if you do <em>anything</em> else that threatens my
people or anyone important to my country, or if I even <em>think</em>
you intend to, I will rip your head off and sh&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
<strong>"Thomas Rheinhart, you will cease this."</strong>
</p>

<p>
Thomas snarled, spinning around to face the speaker.  He didn't let go
of me, so I was dragged fast across the gray stone floor, getting road
rash down my back right through my shirt.
</p>

<p>
The room was ten feet high and the figure standing behind us was at
least twenty; the room hadn't expanded at all, and yet somehow this
guy had plentiful headroom.  I decided to take this as a hint that I
was looking at Yet Another God.  Well, that and the fact that he was
twenty feet tall, dressed in an Adjudicator's robe, and glowing.
</p>

<p>
<em>~Whee, it's Yet Another God!  I wonder if he'll mind if I call him
YAG?~</em> my brain threw out at me. I was swamped in fear and pain,
and apparently my thinkmeat had decided to take a nice little vacation
to La-La-Land.  <em>~That's a good name.  It would be so much simpler:
there'd be Loki, and Ilara, and YAG.  And when I meet another one, he
can be YAG too. YAG2?  Nah, just YAG too.  That would be great,
introducing two YAGs to each other. "YAG, meet YAG.  YAG, YAG.  Great
to meet you both, how are the spouses and little YAGlings?"~</em>
</p>

<p>
It was possible that my brain was not working at its best as I floated
in my pain haze.
</p>

<p>
"He's a traitor!" Thomas snarled, his face twisting in hate-filled
rage.
</p>

<p>
YAG folded his arms and looked down at Thomas with patient
disapproval.  <strong>"He is what you and your Archmagi made of him.
And he is no longer even that; he has lifted the spell from himself.
Now, be silent."</strong>  He gestured with two fingers and Thomas was
tossed aside and forced to his knees, pinned there as though by the
hand of an invisible giant.
</p>

<p>
<strong>"You and your Landguard are new to my service, Thomas
Rheinhart, and I recognize that your former patron had different
methods.  Nonetheless, you are mine now, and I will not allow
this."</strong>
</p>

<p>
"He killed...ngh...the Archmagi, butchered...a village.
Can't...ngh...trust&mdash;" Thomas grunted, struggling to push himself
back to his feet against the implacable force of the god's power.
</p>

<p>
YAG frowned and flicked his fingers down more firmly; Thomas hit the
ground hard. <strong>"Cease, paladin.  Listen. And learn."</strong>
</p>

<p>
He turned away from Thomas and took two steps to me, shrinking as he
came.  Bending down, he brushed one hand down my body, wiping the
injuries off of me as an inky blob which he held consideringly in one
hand.
</p>

<p>
The pain vanished, and I huffed out a breath I hadn't realized I was
holding.  "Thank you, uh..." I stuttered.
</p>

<p>
"I am the True God of Flobovia, Tarisia, and all the rest of Arannias.
I am He whom the Landguard serve," he declaimed with more than a hint
of smugness.
</p>

<p>
It took me a second to recognize the name of Flobovia's continent, but
I promptly brushed it off in favor of the more important fact: I was
talking to the 'True God.'  And he didn't seem to want to unscrew my
head or make tricky deals...in fact, he seemed kinda friendly.
</p>

<p>
"Shailos.  You're Shailos, right?  What did you mean that the
Landguard were 'new to your service'?"
</p>

<p>
Shailos's eyebrow went up.  "That is an old name; where did you hear
it?"
</p>

<p>
"From Loki...er, Wilgam?  Anyway, he's been talking to me lately.  He
mentioned it." I smiled slightly; it was true, but pretty condensed.
And I would prefer that it stay condensed, given that it was Shailos's
Edict I had been busy violating at the time.
</p>

<p>
"Huh," said the 'True God' in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"So, you were saying? About how it is that the Landguard are 'new to
your service'?"
</p>

<p>
Shailos looked at me a moment longer and then shrugged off the
surprise.  "The Landguard converted to my worship when I brought you
through time."
</p>

<p>
I just stared.
</p>

<p>
"Hang on," I demanded.  "The Landguard gave up their old god&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Gods," he interrupted.  "They worshipped a variety of false gods."
</p>

<p>
I nodded blankly.  "Ok.  So, they gave up their old gods and started
worshipping you?  I mean, yes, that pull-through-spacetime thing was
impressive as hell&mdash;oh, and by the way, thanks bunches&mdash;but
no matter how impressive it was, shouldn't at least <em>one</em> of
them have decided to stick to their original god?"
</p>

<p>
"It was the price," he declared.  "The price of your salvation was
that the Landguard give themselves to me."
</p>

<p>
I was pretty sure that someone had just dumped icewater in my
underpants.  "They all became your worshippers...for me?"
</p>

<p>
Shailos nodded gravely.  "It was their duty; they must give anything
for the Land, the Writ, the ruler.  They know the terms when they take
the oath, and they know there is no going back."
</p>

<p>
"But..." I had no idea where that question was going, so I started
over.  "But your tenents say that you are the only god, that the
others are...just spirits, or something.  How can they just change
their beliefs?  I mean, sure, they could start doing the ceremonies
and paying lip service, but how can they actually stop believing in
their own personally-chosen gods?"
</p>

<p>
Shailos frowned in puzzlement.  "They do it of their own will, if they
are able. If not, they may pray for me to help them, and I will change
their hearts."
</p>

<p>
I gaped.  "You <em>what?!</em>"
</p>

<p>
He was moving from puzzled to irritated by now.  "If a mortal honestly
wishes to change patrons, then the new deity may, with the mortal's
agreement, change the truth written on his heart.  Thus, the old
allegiances are severed and the new are forged into truth."
</p>

<p>
My brain was throwing up <em>System error: kernel panic</em> messages
left and right.  My stomach just wanted to be throwing up.
"But...don't they lose their paladin status if they switch gods?"
</p>

<p>
He was definitely looking irritated at my inquisitiveness.  "So long as
I am willing to provide the support for their status, it may be
carried over seamlessly from their former object of worship to myself.
Now, enough questions. We have other things to discuss."
</p>

<p>
I gaped at him a bit longer, then clopped my mouth closed and nodded;
the nod was somewhat jerky as I was still trying to get my brain fully
rebooted.  I couldn't believe that anyone would make that kind of
sacrifice for me.
</p>

<p>
"Right.  Yessir.  Other things.  Like, um...."
</p>

<p>
He turned back to Thomas.  Somehow, in the process of turning, he had
once again grown to his previous towering
should-not-fit-in-this-room-but-somehow-does-because-he's-YAG height.
</p>

<p>
"<strong>Thomas Rheinhart, you shall be judged.</strong>" Shailos's
voice was soft, yet it echoed through the room like the horn of the
apocalypse.
</p>

<p>
"You have failed in your duty, Thomas," he continued, losing the boom
and reverb.  "Most recently, you laid these wounds on the ruler you
are sworn to protect.  Feel them now."  He bent down and pressed the
inky blob of my injuries into Thomas's back.  The sound of bone
snapping rang through the room as Thomas's elbow was crushed, his knee
shattered, his ribs snapped, his hand pulverized.  Thomas didn't cry
out, but he went pale as a ghost and fell to the side, clutching his
knee.
</p>

<p>
"Earlier today, you laid this wound on another human."  Shailos
flicked his finger and an invisble hand did to Thomas what Thomas had
earlier done to Albrecht.  This time Thomas could not remain entirely
silent; his breath gasped out and his good hand clapped itself over
his ruined eye.
</p>

<p>
"Justify yourself, Commander," demanded the voice of the God standing
next to me, sounding like a judge demanding the defendant's plea.
</p>

<p>
I don't know why, but I felt the need to protect Thomas.  "Please
stop," I told Shailos; my voice was somewhat wavery and a lot less
certain than I would have liked, but I managed.  "Thomas doesn't
deserve this."
</p>

<p>
He looked at me with a single raised eyebrow.  "Until I appeared, he
was inflicting those wounds on <em>you</em>, yet you defend him?"
</p>

<p>
I sighed and scrubbed my hands over my face.  When Shailos removed my
injuries he didn't clean out the adrenaline and endorphins my body had
been busily pumping out to handle the stress and pain; I was feeling a
bit giddy.  Also, tired and drained.  But still giddy.
</p>

<p>
"Yeah, I'm not quite over that but, in his defense, I did just kill
off a couple thousand of what were his family by all but blood."  I
shrugged.  Shailos simply waited, saying nothing.  I groped around for
something else to say, but nothing came to hand.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I found my argument.  "If it was wrong for him to torture me,
then how is it right for you to torture him?  In my world we have an
expression 'an eye for an eye leaves everyone blind.'"  I pointed to
where Thomas's hand was clamped over his face.  "What you are doing
is <em>literally</em> an eye for an eye. And it's wrong."  I glanced
up and quavered just a bit.  This was <em>really</em> not the time to
be standing on my antitheist principles. "Um.  It's wrong, sir."
</p>

<p>
Both of Shailos's eyebrows were raised now.  "I see.  Very well,
little mortal.  If you would speak in his defense then proceed.  In
regard to his actions towards you and the High Marshal, speak."
</p>

<p>
I paused, swallowing.  Lovely.  I always wanted to be a defense
attorney while my brain was all wackadoo from post-injury hormones.
Oh, the excitement.
</p>

<p>
I licked my lips, hesitating for a moment, and dove in.  "Well...as
far as he knew, I was still under the effects of the Archmagi's spell.
I had just done something that harmed the Land, but I had no remorse
and no fear, so I couldn't be reasoned with or intimidated.  The only
way to prevent me from doing it again was to make it clear that it
would have real consequences to me personally."
</p>

<p>
Defending Thomas felt extremely strange.  On the one hand, torture,
ow.  On the other, it looked like Shailos was going to torture and
probably kill him, which wasn't right.  At base, Thomas was a good man
who had devoted his life to protecting others and was more than
willing to lay down his life for them.  And, truth be told, I deserved
far worse than what he had done to me.
</p>

<p>
Shailos considered what I had said and then studied Thomas closely.
"True.  Yet that is not why he hurt you.  He hurt you from anger, for
personal revenge.  Isn't that so, Thomas?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas struggled in the grip of the god's power a moment long but,
eventually, had to recognize that he couldn't escape.  The fight
seemed to go out of him and he sagged, the anger and determination
sliding away to leave only sadness and...was that shame?
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Highlord.  His argument is true, but I didn't think of it then.
It was just anger."
</p>

<p>
Shailos's expression never changed, but his voice became demanding.
"This isn't the first time, is it, Thomas?  You've always had a
temper."
</p>

<p>
The shame became clearer.  "Yes, Highlord," he whispered.  
</p>

<p>
"Tell Me of your temper, Thomas Rheinhart.  Tell Me in front of your
Lord and victim.  Whom have you harmed because of your temper?" his
god demanded.
</p>

<p>
Thomas sighed, looking at the floor but still speaking clearly; he
sounded very, very tired.  "There was Jake&mdash;I mean, His Imperial
Majesty&mdash;just now.  There was Albrecht, this morning.  I could
say that I was eliminating the threat of a traitor&mdash;he failed to
share critical intelligence, and that failure resulted in the deaths
of most of the Landguard, which severely compromises our ability to
protect the Land.  But...that's not why I did it.  It was pure temper;
I wanted vengeance."
</p>

<p>
Shailos nodded.  "I suppose you could claim that two fits of temper in
a lifetime of duty represent a forgivable failing.  I could simply
assign penance...."
</p>

<p>
Thomas shook his head.  "No."  Awkwardly, he pushed himself up to a
sitting position, his broken leg stretched out in front of him and his
shattered arm protectively cradled to his chest.  He bowed his head.
"Those weren't the first.  As a boy, I fought.  A lot.  I was strong,
and proud, and a bully.  I joined the militia and excelled.  And then
I met Joseph; I was stronger, but Joseph was better than me at all the
drills, and he was snotty.  His father was a knight, and he never let
me forget that I was the son of a baker.  For months, he rode me about
it.  One day, he made one dig too many about my parents, about
how&mdash;" He stopped, his mouth tightening into an angry line at the
memory.  "He pushed me too far and I punched him.  He went down and I
jumped on him and started pounding him."
</p>

<p>
He sighed and shook his head; the regret was palpable, but he
continued unflinchingly.  "I hit him and hit him until he stopped
moving.  I had hurt him, badly.  When I realized what I had done, I
picked him up and ran for the cleric.  Phillip&mdash;my village
Landguard&mdash;happened to be passing by and was able to heal him."
</p>

<p>
He paused, swallowing and looking haunted.  "I was very nearly too
late; he could have died if Phillip hadn't been going to the market
just at that moment.  I still see his face, sometimes."
</p>

<p>
He looked into the past, his eye full of memories and pain.  "After
that, I did my best to change.  I became the protector of the younger,
weaker children.  I wasn't perfect; I still lost my temper sometimes.
I shouted at them often, and once I slapped a boy so hard I knocked
out one of his teeth.  The priest was able to regrow it, but it should
never have happened."
</p>

<p>
He sighed again and shifted, trying to relieve his knee.  "Phillip saw
that I was working to improve.  He told me to apply for the next
Landguard intake; he said I had the potential, if I could learn to
control my temper."  He snorted a bit and his lips twisted in a rueful
smile.  "Duncan taught me that lesson, oh yes.  He insulted me,
belittled me, slapped me, spit on me...over and over, and always in
front of everyone.  I would bear it as long as I could because I knew
I needed to learn.  Eventually, I would get angry and take a swing at
him." He paused, and for a moment there was an outright grin as he
looked up at me.  "I usually woke up when they poured the first bucket
of water on me, but sometimes it took two or three."

<p>
He looked at Shailos and shrugged.  "You know all this, Highlord;
after a while, I learned control.  After intake, I never lost that
control. Not once.  Not with Duke Frederick's contempt of the
Landguard as 'ceremonial popinjays only effective for their excessive
number of magic items,' not with the Archpriest and his criticism of
our faiths, not with Lady Justice and her empire-building attempts to
be the sole source of law.  Never.  I didn't even raise my voice in
anger.  And then today," He stopped and gulped, his eye shining with
unshed tears. "Today, they all died.  Almost everyone I care about,
dead and turned into monsters.  And every wraith or shadow that I kill
from now on, I'm going to have to wonder if it was someone that I
trained, if I approved their acceptance at intake, if I met their
family at one of our dinings-out.  I lost them all, and I lost my
temper again.  Twice."
</p>

<p>
His gaze shifted to me.  "I am truly sorry, Jake.  My actions bring
shame to me, and to the Landguard.  I failed you today, and I failed
myself."
</p>

<p>
"That is not your only failure, Thomas Rheinhart," Shailos announced.
"Your preparation has been inadequate.  When the Deorsi attacked, your
tactics were inadequate; you used the Landguard purely for their
swords instead of using all of their capabilities.
What <em>should</em> you have done?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas didn't hesitate for a moment.  "Mage defense on His Imperial
Majesty, then have a squad escort him out of there at top speed.  Two
more squads with them as combined arms; half a squad on circle-two
physical defense, the rest on battlefield control and countermage
shoots.  I should have taken one squad and rallied the regular army,
deploying them around the square for containment; we could have
advanced inwards, pushing the Deorsi troops up against the Wall of
Force and pinning them there for our mages to kill off.  While I was
doing that, I could have given Duncan tactical control of the
remaining Landguard, with orders to countershoot the enemy magi and
then get to the Deorsi's emergence point and choke it with bodies."
</p>

<p>
My eyebrows shot up and bounced off my slightly-receding hairline.
Clearly, Thomas had devoted a lot of thought to analyzing his mistakes
and evolving that battleplan.
</p>

<p>
Unlike me, Shailos was not surprised at all. "If you know what you
should have done, why didn't you do it?  Why did you treat the
Landguard as a purely physical weapon?"
</p>

<p>
By now Thomas looked so embarrassed that I kept expecting him to melt.
"It...didn't occur to me.  We've never been in a battlefield situation
like that before&mdash;no Landguard has, not for centuries.  I've
fended off eighteen assassination attempts, but always by small
groups.  When you're attacked at close range by a single group, the
right answer is to go close in, kill the attackers as quickly as
possible; once we're in reach we can take out an assassination squad
in a round.  The Deorsi troops were right there in front of us, so I
acted as I was accustomed to, as I had trained to; I went after the
proximate threat. I should have left that to Duncan while I addressed
the bigger picture."
</p>

<p>
"And if you were attacked right now?" Shailos demanded.  "If a swarm
of enemies came through the door this very moment?  What would you do?"
</p>

<p>
"Mage defense," Thomas answered without an instant's hesitation.
"This Mansion is sustained by a spell, and the extradimensional space
it creates vanishes when the spell runs out or is countered.  Activate
mage defense and we'd be dumped out into Gr&#491;fhamr proper, which
is just a series of nested Portable Holes.  The magic of a Hole lies
in creating the portal to the extradimensional space, not in creating
the space itself. The anti-magic would shut down the entryway and
leave us isolated in a single Hole; there wouldn't be room for more
than one attacker to arrive with us.  Against one person, with no
magic and in tight quarters, I could easily kill him without letting
him around me to attack Ja&mdash;His Majesty.  Once he was dead, we
would wait until the air was running out, then I'd drop the
anti-magic.  By then the other Landguard should have arrived but, if
they hadn't, I'd be in close with the enemy, surprise on my side, and
all my enhancements and gear working."
</p>

<p>
I blinked in surprise and impressedness.  "You've been thinking about
this, haven't you?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas shifted his gaze to me and gave a frim nod.  "Yes.  Ever since
we had to bring you back, I've been brainstorming contingencies and
reaction plans with the others, as well as adding new, more
military-oriented, combat drills to everyone's training time."
</p>

<p>
I frowned as a thought hit me.  I turned, looking up at Shailos.  "Why
are you talking to him about this now?"
</p>

<p>
Shailos cocked his head and looked at me in puzzlement.  "Because he
has violated the code that I expect of my paladins, of course."
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.  "No, I don't mean 'why are you talking to him about
this.'  I mean 'why are you talking to him about this <em>now</em>',
instead of three hours ago when the incident with Albrecht happened?
Why wait?"
</p>

<p>
He nodded, smiled, and turned to look at Thomas.  "Answer him.  Show
Me that you understand more than fighting."
</p>

<p>
Thomas looked at me and shrugged; the unconscious movement pinched his
face up and widened his eyes in pain.  He took a moment to center;
when he spoke, his voice was strained but relatively normal.  "Had He
appeared in front of everyone to chastise me, it would have destroyed
my command authority, and would have put us in a bad political stance
with the Deorsi.  Even if He had taken us out of time, the timeskip
would have been obvious, and would have had to be explained.  Any
explanation we could give would still leave the Deorsi suspicious,
which would have had pretty much the same effect as having Him appear
openly.  By waiting until we were alone, He has more options about how
and when to exact my penance."
</p>

<p>
He turned back to his god.  "Highlord, I understand that I will need
to be stripped of my rank, and that I can't be kept on as a line
troop; it would disrupt chain of command too much.  My behavior was
inexcusable, and I do not defend it.  Whatever the provocation, there
was no excuse for my actions.  My only request is that you not let me
rise as an undead.  I do not want to become one more enemy for my
people to fight."
</p>

<p>
Shailos looked grimly at me.  "What do you think, Jacob?  You are the
aggrieved party here.  Shall I demote him?  Strip him of his standing?
Take him back to Flobovia, or to another part of Anundj&aring;?  Shall
I simply kill him?  As a fallen paladin, eternal torment awaits him;
the scales would be balanced for his treatment of you.  What
punishment do you feel is appropriate?"
</p>

<p>
My mind completely froze, and it took me long seconds to kick it back
into gear.
</p>

<p>
I considered Thomas carefully as I thought.  What
punishment <em>did</em> he deserve?  He had tortured me, but not
gratuitously; regardless of whether his actions were caused by rage or
by planning, he hadn't been doing it just to cause pain.  His goal had
been behavior modification and, truth be told, he was totally
justified.  The simple fact remained that I had killed a thousand
common citizens of Flobovia, killed two of the Archmagi, and set up
the Landguard for destruction; I deserved everything Thomas had done
to me and more.  His primary duty was the Land, not the ruler; he was
well within his rights to simply kill me for harming those
people. Instead, he had tried to turn me back into a positive
resource.
</p>

<p>
<em>~Granted, it was a pretty painful method of behavior
modification,~</em> I thought ruefully.  <em>~Then again, I'm hardly
in a position to complain; I have almost literal lakes of blood on my
hands.  A simple beating from Thomas&mdash;which he fully intended to
heal in just a few minutes&mdash;doesn't really stack up against my
serial-killing ways.~</em>
</p>

<p>
I strung together a thoughtweb, starting with a root node of
'punishment for Thomas'.  Initial derivative nodes were 'potential
punishments', 'appropriateness', 'outcomes of punishment', and
'outcomes of non-punishment'.  I branched out, starting from
'potential punishments' and listing off my top eight options.  I
connected each of them through 'appropriateness' and immediately
eliminated five of them.  I jumped over to 'outcomes of punishment'
and branched out to 'political', 'chain of command effect', 'Landguard
effectiveness delta'.  I connected these back to my 'potential
punishments' node and started filtering.
</p>

<p>
"I think..." I began, and then hesitated.  A moment to doublecheck the
web and I was confident in my answer.  I nodded decisively. "I think I
would like to keep him as the Commander.  He's an effective leader;
whatever mistakes he's made were just that&mdash;mistakes, due to
inexperience with a new environment.  He's recognized that, is working
to correct it, and couldn't possibly be more motivated; his
replacement might not have the same drive.  He will also be a much
more effective interface with the Deorsi than anyone else I can think
of to replace him, and there's value in not having a leadership
transition right now."  I debated adding the last point: 'and from now
on he will be almost fanatically devoted to me for sparing him'.  I
considered it, but held my tongue; it would be more likely to be true
if I left it unvoiced.
</p>

<p>
Shailos smiled; a true smile this time.  "You see, Thomas?
Compassion.  Your Archmagi removed that, yet here it is.  He has
broken the effect of the spell which caused him to take all of
his...inappropriate actions.  The spell that you approved, thinking it
would be beneficial.  And, since he chooses compassion, I shall grant
it.
</p>

<p>
"Thomas Rheinhart, you are judged.  You have transgressed, deeply,
against My code.  These injuries that you suffer now, you will suffer
every night until I am satisfied that you have truly changed.
Furthermore, if you inflict any pain that I deem unworthy of you, you
shall suffer that pain threefold.  You shall suffer it when you
inflict it, and every night from then on."
</p>

<p>
He leaned down with a flinty gaze; Thomas quailed under those eyes.
"Make no mistake, Thomas: cross My code again, and I shall strip you
of your rank and your standing regardless of what your lord may wish."
Shailos held the gaze for a moment longer and then, satisfied that the
message had been received, straightened and looked beneficient again.
"Go into the world, Thomas Rheinhart, and obey my code henceforth."
There was a flash of light, and he was gone.
</p>

<p>
Thomas twitched in surprise and immediately went white as a sheet when
his broken ribs stabbed him.  I moved to his side, propping him up
carefully.
</p>

<p>
"You better heal those up," I told him frankly.  "I need you
functional when we go outside."
</p>

<p>
He hesitated, looking at me uncertainly.  "I'm not certain that's
appropriate.  The Highlord gave me this penance; I should carry it."
</p>

<p>
I grunted in disgust.  "Well, I'm ordering you to heal it up, because
I need my chief bodyguard functional and undistracted.  If Shailos
objects, tell him to talk to me about it. Besides, he made it clear
that you'll be getting these back later tonight, so you can do your
stoic thing then."
</p>

<p>
He studied me a moment longer and then nodded, accepting.  Laying his
good hand gently on his ribs he told the universe to "Cure Serious
Wounds. Cure Light Wounds.  Cure Light Wounds."  Golden light flowed
out of his hands and through his body, starting at the ribs and
spreading through him, seeking out every trace of damage and
evaporating it.  After a moment, he was able to breathe easy again
and all his bits were whole.
</p>

<p>
He studied me for a moment; I could see the shame still lingering
behind his eyes, but it shared space with a heavy layer of gratitude.
"Thank you, Your Majesty.  I will do everything I can to be worthy of
your compassion.  I swear, I will <em>never</em> act like that to you
again.  On my immortal soul, I swear."  The earnestness of it was
amazing, as though he desperately <em>needed</em> me to understand and
believe.
</p>

<p>
I sighed.  "Good enough.  You suffered, I suffered, I'm a traitorous
bastard, you're a recovering bully.  Let's just call it good and move
on."  I straightened up, my knees creaking a bit in protest, and held
out a hand to help him to his feet as a gesture of solidarity.  (For
the record, pulling up a two hundred and fifty pound man who is
wearing full armor requires substantial bracing of the feet.  Bracing
which I had not done.  Forsooth, it was embarrassing.)
</p>

<p>
Thomas caught me and set me back on balance without saying a word.  I
blushed and carefully acted like nothing had happened.  As any cat
would say: I meant to do that!
</p>

<p>
I shook the embarrassment off and pasted a smile on my face.  "Right!
Let's go find Albrecht and figure out how to avoid us all getting
dead.  I think that sounds like an awesome plan.  How's that work for
you?"
</p>

<p>
He smiled back; a small little smile, but honest.  "It sounds like an
awesome plan indeed."
