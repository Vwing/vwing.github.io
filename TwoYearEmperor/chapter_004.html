<hr />
  
<p>
I was right, it was a miserable meeting.  The first hint of trouble
was when Lady Justice pointed out that her justiciars needed to be
excluded from the draft because otherwise Flobovian civilization would
collapse.  Lady Shadow responded snidely, saying that surely that was
an overstatement.  Duke Frederick, more formally known as Lord
Patriciate since he represented the peerage (with a title like that,
it was obvious why he went by 'Duke Frederick'), started talking about
what he would do with the troops once they were assembled.  When
Thomas quietly pointed out that I would be in charge, not Frederick,
things went nuclear.  I, of course, ended up stuck smack in the
middle of that little 'discussion.'  Happy happy joy joy, except not.
</p>

<p>
Things went downhill from there; I was ready to wrap it up even before
Duke Frederick started pounding the table and screaming about the
madness of letting an untried outlander lead the
army&mdash;particularly one who "showed as much martial skill as my
daughter's pet pig."
</p>

<p>
By the time I made it back to the sitting room, I was utterly drained.
I took up my usual seat by the fire and leaned back with a sigh,
closing my eyes.
</p>

<p>
Blissful, restful silence spread through the room.  Allison crackled
quietly in the fireplace, and Thomas respected my clear desire to
recharge. 
</p>

<p>
"Could you make it a bit warmer please, Allison?" I asked without
opening my eyes.
</p>

<p>
She didn't respond verbally, but the warm glow of the fire got
brighter through my eyelids and I could feel the heat beating on my
face and soaking into me.
</p>

<p>
Between the hard meeting and the lack of sleep from last night, my
energy was at a low ebb.  The desire to just sleep, hopefully to wake
up and discover that this was all a bad dream, pulled at me like a
riptide.  For a moment I started to nod off but I managed to shake out
of it; there was an invading army to deal with.  I forced my eyes open
with a sigh and focused on Thomas.
</p>

<p>
"Any word on that experiment with the Dedicated Wright and the
scroll?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
He nodded.  "I got the message just as we were leaving the Conclave
meeting.  Worked perfectly; the mage was able to read the scroll
through the Wright's eyes just as if she were there.  Of course, the
effect still started from the caster herself, but it did allow her to
trigger a spell without speaking, moving, or having a scroll in her
hands.  There's definitely some good surprise value there."
</p>

<p>
I frowned, dismayed.  I'd been counting on being able to cast spells
remotely by having the Wrights read the scrolls from far away.  There
was a long pause as I flipped through the Brainopedia for several
minutes, trying to find a replacement.</p>

<p>
Finally, I saw something that would work.  I smiled tiredly, relieved
that I didn't have to throw out the whole plan.  "Ok, I want as many
Dedicated Wrights as we can scrape up; find out how many there are and
negotiate with the owners to use them as part of the war effort.
Promise them spells, magic items, money&mdash;whatever it takes, but
get them.  Start making more as fast as possible, and expedite it; use
magic to keep the workers going 24/7, give them Haste potions to work
faster, whatever it takes."
</p>

<p>
He nodded, dispatched a Sending, and went back to being silent.  He
didn't look like his usual placid, patient self though.
</p>

<p>
"Something wrong, Thomas?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
He paused before he answered, clearly choosing his words carefully.
"That meeting seemed...difficult for you, Jake."
</p>

<p>
I sighed.  "Yeah.  I don't like confrontational discussions.  I find
them unproductive.  I prefer to discuss things, get to a consensus,
and then work together on it."
</p>

<p>
Again he paused.  Again the careful word choice.  "Do they leave you
feeling...rattled?"
</p>

<p>
I grimaced uncomfortably.  It was one of the things I'd never admitted
to anyone&mdash;that, way down deep, I was afraid I was a coward.  But my
sense of basic honesty wouldn't let me answer with anything less than
truth.  "Yes, they do," I admitted, forcing myself to look him in the
face.  I could feel my heart speeding up and my hands were cold with
stress but my face was flushed with embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
Thomas paused for a long time, then he looked at the fireplace.
"Allison?  Give us a moment, please."  The words may have been framed
politely, but it was clear that 'no' was not an acceptable answer.
</p>

<p>
For once, even Allison sounded intimidated, but she didn't budge.
"Thomas, you know I can't.  Not unless he tells me to."
</p>

<p>
I waved her off without looking away from Thomas.  "Go on, Allison.
I'll call you if I need you.  Please light the candles for us before
you go."
</p>

<p>
Without a word, she flicked from candle to candle, sitting on each
wick just long enough to get it burning.  Then she was gone without a
trace.
</p>

<p>
Finally having privacy, Thomas leaned forward, elbows on his knees.and
stared me right in the eye.  When he spoke, his voice was soft and
intense, and he didn't blink at all.
</p>

<p>
"Your behavior is not acceptable in a war-time ruler.  The existence
of this nation is under grave threat and we need a decisive, confident
ruler.  We need someone with new ideas who can make things happen even
against opposition.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see a way to win this war, Jake.  Not against an army that
outnumbers us five to one and outpowers us magically as well.  None of
our other generals see a way either.  We can slow them down, yes.
Reduce their numbers, absolutely.  But we can't <em>win</em> using our
own military knowledge and traditions.  We need someone from outside
that framework, someone who can provide ideas that we haven't had yet.
The only person who can possibly do that in the time we have is you.
</p>

<p>
"You <em>must</em> be able to handle confrontation.  When you have an idea
that you think will work, you <em>must</em> make it happen, no matter what;
even if it fails it might give someone else an idea.  Most of all, you
need to look confident; the morale of the troops requires it.  In that
meeting, you looked intimidated and that is the last thing you can
be&mdash;the Conclave will eat you alive if you show weakness, and the
army will not follow a ruler they perceive as weak.  Right now, you
look as weak as a rotten branch."
</p>

<p>
He was right; I was clamping down on my breathing and body language,
forcing myself to sit calmly and keep a blank face...but my hands were
freezing, my palms were sweaty, and I had to swallow.
</p>

<p>
Thomas wasn't done though.  His voice got even more intense; there was
nothing left to it now except the primal sound of a hungry wolf.
"Understand, Jake; I like you.  I think you're a good person, honest,
and friendly.  You didn't ask to be here, or to have this duty.  And
none of that matters in the slightest.  My duty to the Land comes
first and I will follow it; either you fix your attitude or I kill you
and take command myself.  The nobles will panic if I do, and probably
revolt; the Landguard will need to kill all the Dukes and a lot of the
Counts in order to get the rest to fall in line, and even then it will
cause a major civil war within a few years.  And it means the Deorsi
will conquer the nation while we're sorting out the power structure.
But the Landguard <em>can</em> do it, and I <em>will</em> do it if I
have to, because it will let me get some of the population evacuated
while I and the Landguard die buying them time."
</p>

<p>
Finally, he leaned back.  The wolf retreated, once again masked behind
its human facade.  "I'll support you in every way I can.  But
ultimately, you need to handle this."
</p>

<p>
My heart was hammering hard enough to burst out of my chest.  As
discreetly as possible, I pressed my hands onto the chairarms to keep
them from visibly shaking.  I took a moment to be sure that my voice
wouldn't break when I spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's certainly...motivating.  I'm not sure what specifically
I need to do, though.  I wish I handled confrontation better; it's
something I've wanted for a long time, I just never knew how to fix
it."
</p>

<p>
Thomas grinned exactly the sort of grin that you grin at someone
you're about to play a really, really cruel prank on.  "I think I have
a solution," he said, coming to his feet.  "Come with me."
</p>

<p>
I rose and followed him.  I was really, really confident that,
wherever we were going, I was not going to enjoy it.
</p>

<p>
He led me out of the castle and down to the area behind the stables
where the horses were exercised.  Along the way he dispatched a
Sending, but spoke too softly for me to hear the message.
</p>

<p>
When we arrived, the sun was just touching the horizon and the area
was deserted except for a man in Landguard uniform.  He was at least
twenty years my senior, maybe more.  His hair was pure gray, there
were more lines in his face than a roadmap, and he looked like he was
made out of nothing but dried leather.  There wasn't an ounce of fat
anywhere on him and my "not gonna like this" meter pegged, then blew
out the dial and moved to Florida for a nice comfortable retirement.
</p>

<p>
Thomas walked up to the other man and nodded briskly.  "Sergeant, Jake
here has a confidence problem and doesn't know how to solve it.  Fix
it.  Fast."  He turned and left without so much as a backwards glance.
</p>

<p>
The sergeant turned to me, sized me up, then smiled and extended his
hand.  "I'm Sergeant Duncan, and it's an honor to meet you
face-to-face M'Lord.  Don't worry, I've helped a lot of men with
similar issues."
</p>

<p>
I smiled back, a bit uncertainly; my 20 ranks in Knowledge Skill
(Genre Savvy) had me expecting a 'Full Metal Jacket' replay, but the
greeting had been friendly; perhaps this would be more along the line
of "inspirational talk and physical training."  I reached out to take
his hand.  "It's a pleasure, Sergeant.  Please, call me&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I was face down in the dirt; my knee was on fire from where the
Sergeant had brutally kicked it out from under me.  He had one heavy
boot on my neck and my arm in a vicious submission lock.
</p>

<p>
"I KNOW WHO YOU ARE, MAGGOT!  SHUT YOUR GODDAMN PIE-HOLE!  YOU HAVE A
'CONFIDENCE PROBLEM', DO YOU?!  IN THIS TRADE, WE CALL THAT BEING A
GUTLESS COWARD!  DON'T YOU AGREE, PISS-PANTS?!"
</p>

<p>
My mouth was full of dirt and I could barely breathe for the pain, but
I managed to grunt out "No!"  In response he lifted his boot off my
neck, kicked me in the side, and then stomped my face back down.  This
time his boot was on my head, and he actually ground it in, making my
ear bleed.
</p>

<p>
"WHAT WAS THAT MAGGOT?!  I COULDN'T HEAR YOU THROUGH ALL THAT
WHIMPERING!  YOU'RE A PISS-PANTS COWARD, AREN'T YOU?!"
</p>

<p>
"NO!" I yelled as loudly as I could, which wasn't very.  My brain was
floundering.  I hadn't been in a real fight in my life&mdash;even in
grade school, it was more pushing and shoving than real hitting.  I'd
done some martial arts but that wasn't real fighting...and besides,
I'd always been too lazy to really pursue it.  I had no idea how to
process this, how to respond, and my mind was just shutting down.
</p>

<p>
"FINE THEN, MAGGOT!  YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT BALLS?!  SHOW ME!"  He
yanked me to my feet, nearly dislocating my arm in the process.
Before I could catch my balance, he landed a straight kick in my gut
that sent me sprawling on my ass.  Immediately, he was on me, booting
me in the face, then yanking me up by my collar and shoving me back
again.  I stumbled, flailing like an idiot, and this time he let me
catch my balance.
</p>

<p>
"Go on, momma's boy.  Feelin' scared, crybaby?  Door's over there, so
go ahead and run.  I won't even try to stop you, you pile of crap,
'cause you're not worth the effort.  We all hoped that this time we'd
get a <em>decent</em> Lord, someone we could take pride in, someone
who could actually pull this off and save the Land.  Instead we get
you.  You and your worthless fat goddamn useless ass.  From what the
Commander tells me, your supposedly oh-so-brilliant otherwordly ideas
are for CRAP, you pathetic quim."
</p>

<p>
He spit on the ground.  "So go on and run.  Do us all a favor, you
cowardly piss-bucket because it's hot out here, and you're not worth
raising a sweat for.  Or you can show me you've got some damn balls
and take a swing."  His face wore a nasty grin; I knew he was going to
curbstomp me, and he knew that I knew.
</p>

<p>
I spat out the dirt, never taking my eyes off him.  Blood was gushing
from my mouth; both lips were split, and several of my teeth had been
knocked right out.  My jaw felt like someone was shoving a chainsaw
into it, my heart was pounding and I could feel my eyes staring wide.
My breath came in fast, shallow pants.
</p>

<p>
"COME ON, MAGGOT!  I AIN'T GOT ALL DAY!" he shouted, waving me forward
with one hand.
</p>

<p>
I shifted into a defensive stance and took a step to the side, looking
for an opening.
</p>

<p>
I was down again, this time clutching my groin.  He had kicked me so
hard my senses shut down for a moment, the whole world going white and
silent.
</p>

<p>
When it cleared, he was standing back, hands on his hips, laughing
uproariously.  
</p>

<p>
I pushed myself to my feet, unable to straighten up but knowing that
being down was just going to make the next attack worse.
</p>

<p>
He didn't attack though, just kept laughing.  "God, what a worthless
mewling bucket of crap!  I've had twelve year olds apply to join the
'Guard who fought better than you, you pathetic asslicker.  Are you
even ABLE to hit?  Jesus Christ on a cracker, boy, you just plain
<em>SUCK</em> at this.  Tell you what, I'm curious if you've got anything at
<em>all</em> in you, so I'll give you a free hit.  Won't even move.
Take your best shot."
</p>

<p>
I eyed him, not moving; this couldn't have been a more obvious trap
if he'd put out a neon sign.  Slowly, I forced my breathing back under
control until I could straighten up.  My balls still felt like someone
had crushed them in a vice, but at least I could move again.
</p>

<p>
He just waited, smirking at me in contempt.
</p>

<p>
But he had finally given me the time I needed.  I calmed my breathing,
forced my shoulders to relax, and felt my mind detach and go cold.
Everything still hurt just as much, and I knew exactly what was going
to happen&mdash;either I wouldn't swing and he'd beat me senseless, or
I would, in which case he would block and beat me senseless.  Either
way, he was going to hurt me badly, then pull me up and start it all
over.  Despite all that, I was calm.  I knew that, once this crisis
was over, I was going to have the mother of all freakouts but for
right now, I was ok.
</p>

<p>
I'd had this feeling plenty of times before; it usually happened in
crowds, like the few concerts and dance clubs I'd been
to&mdash;basically, anywhere that mobs of people were having a great
time with a shared, emotionally charged experience.  I could never let
myself participate.  I was always separate, watching, wishing I could
be part of the excitement but unable to submerge myself in the mob.
When it happened like that, it was a lonely and miserable
experience...but it also happened whenever there was a crisis and then
it was a blessing; I was calm in the middle of the crisis, saving my
shakes for afterwards.
</p>

<p>
Pulling the calm in deliberately meant that it didn't fit quite right,
and that lack of fit made it fragile...but it was much better.  At
least I could think again.
</p>

<p>
The smirk had finally faded from his face, to be replaced by a frown
of anger and contempt.  "Come on, mouse dick.  Either you take that
shot right the hell now or I swear by the Land, I will kick your
goddamn head in and call it a day.  I am not in the mood for dealing
with some piss-drinking coward when there is a perfectly good card
game waiting for me back at the barracks.  Take.  Your.  Shot."  He
adopted an 'at ease' position, legs shoulder width apart, hands
clasped behind him...but his eyes were still on me and he still had a
look of raw contempt on his face.
</p>

<p>
I knew he meant the part about kicking my head in, so I moved forward,
watching for the inevitable attack.  As I approached, I evaluated
where to hit (not that it would land)&mdash;the throat could be lethal,
and I was feeling ok about that; it was probably the only way I was
going to come out of this not in traction.  A kick to the belly would
keep slightly more range open but wouldn't do enough damage to stop
him.  A kick to the knee might slow him down afterwards.  A shot to
the head seemed like a generally good choice too.
</p>

<p>
I decided I couldn't bring myself to actually kill him, so instead I
stepped in close and slammed a hammerfist into the side of his head,
pivoting from the hips to generate power like I'd been taught.  I
knew, <em>knew</em> that he was going to duck it and smash me again,
but I had nothing to lose so I swung for the fences.
</p>

<p>
He actually stood there and let it land.
</p>

<p>
It wasn't a bad hit, either; a bit off target, it hit just above his
ear instead of on the disabling temple or mastoid bone, but it knocked
him off his feet.  He rolled smoothly and came back up, staggering
just slightly as he caught his balance.  Checking to make sure I
wasn't following up, he shook his head to settle it, then touched the
side the side of his head.
</p>

<p>
"Not bad, maggot," he said, with just the tiniest hint of respect.
"Solid hit; you've got some training.  Not much, and you're obviously
too fat and lazy to stick with it, but you've got some.  'Course, you
should have gone after me while I was down, because now I'm going to
kick your damn teeth in."
</p>

<p>
I knew that he was just trying to rattle me.  Yes, I was a bit lazier
than I thought I should be, but I wasn't a complete couch potato
either.  Yes, I had a spare tire from working a desk job, but I was
fitter than most Americans.  Safe in my detachment, the words just
rolled off like rain off a roof.
</p>

<p>
"Well, back to it, then," he said gleefully.  Then he was coming in
again, but not as fast this time.  Maybe the blow to the head had
scrambled him a little, because I saw through the feint with the left
hand, and he telegraphed the uppercut with his right.  I stepped
around it and went for a kotegaishi wrist throw.  It had always been
my single best aikido move; if I was going to bet on any technique, it
would be this one.
</p>

<p>
I got his wrist, made the initial turn, pulling him around with me.
For once, my technique was flawless: I took exactly the right grip on
exactly the right part of his hand and pivoted my entire body as one
seamless unit with our hands right in front of my power center.  He
was whipped around the outside of the spin, off balance and trying to
catch up to himself.  I brought my other hand up, folded his fingers
back, shifted my left foot back as I started the actual throw.  It
would either slam him hard into the ground or break his arm, depending
on how he took the fall.  I was fine with either outcome.
</p>

<p>
I was face down in the dirt again.  He was kneeling on my neck, both
my arms yanked up behind me. I had no idea what had just happened.
</p>

<p>
"Not bad, kid.  You saw the punch when I hung it out there and you
didn't panic.  Granted, first time I saw that throw you were probably
still in diapers...but not bad.  So, what did you learn here?"
</p>

<p>
Agony was lancing through my shoulders but a part of me was still
cold, still detached.
</p>

<p>
"That I can be calm in a fight," I grunted.
</p>

<p>
"What did you learn?" he demanded, pulling my arms a little higher.  I
hissed in pain.
</p>

<p>
I scrambled for a better answer; what was he looking for?  Whatever it
was, I really wanted to figure it out so that he'd let go of my arms.
"That...this is what a physical fight is like?  What pain is really
like, and so a verbal argument just doesn't stack up?"
</p>

<p>
"Goddamn it you little crap-eater!  Stop wasting my goddamn time and
tell me what the hell you learned!  Or do I need to rip your arms
right off your body and beat you with them?!"  He yanked my arms
significantly higher and I felt something tear.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know!" I yelped.  "I don't know, just let go of my arms and
tell me!"
</p>

<p>
He laughed, but there was honest humor in it.  "Well, first thing you
should have learned, your Almighty Lordness, is that it's ok to ask
for help on a question that you don't know the answer to, or a problem
you don't know how to solve&mdash;like, for example, improving your
confidence.  And that the Landguard is the sensible group to ask; it's
what we're here for, and we won't betray your secrets.  As to
this&mdash;even the other Landguard aren't going to know about these
little sessions of ours.  Now, come on M'Lord.  Let's get you to the
healer."
</p>

<p>
He let go of my arms, releasing them slowly instead of just dropping
them; it prevented them from slamming back down and potentially taking
more damage.
</p>

<p>
One hand under my arm, he brought me back to my feet and braced me for
a moment until I was steady on my feet again.  Then he brushed the
worst of the dust off my tunic and started helping me back into the
castle.
</p>

<p>
We were three corridors down before I thought to ask.  "What's the
second thing?"
</p>

<p>
"Hmm?" he responded, eyebrows raised.
</p>

<p>
"You said the first thing I should have learned was to ask for help.
If that's the first thing, there must be a second thing.  What is it?"
</p>

<p>
He chuckled.  "Oh, that.  Second thing is that you should have learned
not to mess with me, for I <em>am</em> the baddest son of a bitch in
the 'Guard."
</p>

<p>
I nodded, which sent more blood pouring from my battered jaw.  "Oh
yeah.  Definitely got that part."
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
The Landguard healer didn't bat an eye when the Sergeant escorted me
in bruised and battered.  He just looked at the Sergeant, looked at
me, and gave the slightest twitch of a smile.  "I'm terribly sorry you
fell down the stairs M'Lord.  Very slippery, they can be," he said
with a barely-suppressed snicker.  I glared at him but it rolled off.
I really needed to work on my glares.  A despotic ruler should have a
better glare.  And a white cat.  Definitely a white cat.
</p>

<p>
"Here, let me help you with that," said the Healer, now all business.
He laid a hand on each of my shoulders, bowed his head, and whispered
a brief prayer.  Light flooded into me, gold as honey, warm as a cozy
fire.  It spilled down his arms and filled me up, seeking out every
tiny scrape or scratch and washing it away. I could feel the pain
stopping, the bruises fading&mdash;even my teeth growing back!
Afterwards, I felt as refreshed as if I'd just woken up from the best
night's sleep ever.
</p>

<p>
The healer didn't even wait for my thanks, just patted me on the
shoulder and shooed us out the door.
</p>

<p>

"So, that's it then?"  I asked the Sergeant out in the hall.  "One
good beating and my confidence issue is all dealt with?"
</p>

<p>
Just for the record?  Sergeant Duncan has an incredibly creepy grin,
and seeing it now was not a happy-making experience. 
</p>

<p>
"Oh no," he said gleefully.  "We're not even close to done, M'Lord.
Today was just to teach you a proper appreciation of how seriously you
should pay attention during your lessons.  Each time, the lesson will
continue until you actually fight back in an effective way;
eventually, you'll learn to fight back <em>before</em> you get pounded
into hamburger.  Now, you need to go back to planning strategy, I get
that.  And that's going to run late, and afterwards you're going to be
tired.  Which means that will be a <em>perfect</em> time for our next
lesson.  And when that's done, we'll heal you back up, and start again
tomorrow."
</p>

<p>
I groaned, and his grin just got wider and evil-er.  "I don't suppose
just telling you that my confidence was all fixed would be enough to
get me out of this?" I offered weakly.
</p>

<p>
I didn't see him move but suddenly he was right up in my face, glaring
into my eyes and snarling, spittle flying.  "SHUT YOUR TRAP YOU
GUTLESS PIECE OF CRAP!"  I flinched back, my eyes widening.
</p>

<p>
And then he relaxed again, with a smile that held just the faintest
hint of regret.  "You ain't ready yet, M'Lord.  By the time I'm done
you will respond to abuse with either immediate physical action or
relaxed calm.  Signs of intimidation just won't do.  Don't worry, this
ain't my first wolf hunt.  I'll get you there, and probably in less
time than you think."
</p>

<p>
I sighed.  "Yeah, I know.  And I suppose the end of that thought is
really 'less time than you think...it just won't be pleasant.'"
</p>

<p>
He laughed and clapped me on the shoulder before turning to escort me
to the official castle War Room (apparently we had outgrown the
sitting room).  For a moment I found myself wondering why I was only
being escorted by one Landguard instead of the usual four or more.
Then I snorted; who in their right mind would attack Sergeant Duncan?
He'd just shout them to death.
