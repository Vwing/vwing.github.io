<em>
Here you go, folks.  Three challenges for you: 1) What problem did
Jake solve, 2) What problem(s) did Jake create for himself, 3) Why was
the coat essential and what is the note in the footer referring to?

<hr />

<p>
There is nothing bright on the robes of an Adjudicator.  This is by
design; justice is a somber profession that must be treated with the
greatest seriousness and caution.  There must be nothing of
distraction in the garb or surroundings of an Adjudicator, lest he or
she lose focus at a key moment and speak the single wrong word that
lets a murderer go free or, even worse, condemns an innocent soul.
</p>

<p>
Outside, the sun was glimmering faintly through a thin spot in the
overcast. This went unseen in the High Court, where the Lady Justice
sat atop her raised throne as Adjudicator of this critical case.  She
was surrounded by the armed and armored Wardens of the Court, while
the Speaker for the defense stood before her.  His case was concluded,
and he was waiting alongside his clients to find out what the results
of his efforts would be...and just how much havoc would occur
afterwards.
</p>

<p>
The defendants&mdash;five men dressed in the easily recognizable robes
of magi&mdash;sat at a narrow table behind their Speaker.  Their hands
were pressed together palm to palm, bound in leather mittens that
prevented them from moving so much as a finger, lest they make the
handsigns that would bend reality around them.  Gags prevented them
from speaking a single word, again to prevent them weaving a spell.
Behind each wizard stood a Warden, blade in hand, ready to kill the
accused instantly should they somehow manage to free themselves of
their bonds and begin a spell.
</p>

<p>
Excessive as the precautions might seem, they had been proven
essential time and time again throughout Flobovian history; even the
least mage was capable of calling down havoc, and the only way for
mundanes to fight one was to take ruthless advantage of the few
weaknesses that magi have.
</p>

<p>
Behind the accused stood a low barrier dividing the court proper from
the gallery, where the public could come to see justice delivered.
Every seat was full; to the left of the aisle the benches were filled
with common citizens.  Families, fathers and mothers and children, who
had come in hopes that their nation would do what was right, would
protect them against those more powerful than they.  They sat
nervously in their seats, shifting uncomfortably as they darted looks
across the aisle.
</p>

<p>
To the unobservant, those who filled the seats to the right of the
aisle were an elegant sight: urbane men and women in sophisticated
robes, all sitting straight and proud with calm, patient expressions.
</p>

<p>
To those with eyes to see, however, that sight was terrifying, for
those seats were filled with some of the most powerful, and many of
the nearly-as-powerful, of the Association of Magi.  The men and women
on those benches were quite capable of rending the building around
them into fine powder, of not just killing everyone in the room but of
unmaking their existence.  And those expressions that seemed so calm
and patient...well, a jungle cat also seems calm and patient in the
moment before it strikes.
</p>

<p>
Lady Justice raised her judicial scepter in judgement.  "All evidence
having been presented, this court has reached its verdict.  In the
matter of City vs Hillman, Robert, Grace, Tyler, and Alexander, the
court finds the defendants&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The heavy doors of the room crashed open, propelled by a size sixteen
hobnailed boot worn by an enormously powerful warrior.
</p>

<p>
We stalked up the aisle, Thomas and I, me slightly in the lead.  He
carried a crossbow, cocked and aimed before us.  Mine was uncocked and
slung casually over my shoulder, the bolt pointing to the sky behind
me.  My brown leather trenchcoat swirled dramatically around my legs;
I had spent an hour frantically tearing around the castle to find one,
but it was critical for what I was about to do.
</p>

<p>
"Well look at this!" I cried.  "Appears we got here just in the nick
o' time!  What does that make us?!"
</p>

<p>
"Big Damn Heroes, sir!" Thomas shot back.
</p>

<p>
"Ain't we just!" I called, spacing each word with heavy emphasis.  I
dropped the crossbow into alignment; it wasn't cocked and the bolt was
actually glued to the stock (Thomas didn't trust me to not
accidentally shoot someone, possibly him).  Regardless, no one else
needed to know that my weapon was nonfunctional.  "Sorry to interrupt,
folks, but y'all got something that I need, and I'd like to take it
with me."
</p>

<p>
"This is a Court of law, you cannot think to thwart the Writ!" the
Lady Justice asserted in icy tones.  I stifled a giggle. I had given
Thomas a script which he was faithfully sticking to, but somehow the
Lady Justice had gotten <em>her</em> lines right too!  Just for once,
this universe was actually doing right by me.
</p>

<p>
"Y'all see the man behind me with the really big crossbow?  He didn't
want to come in the first place, and he's real good at killin' folk.
So really, it's his will y'all should be worrying about thwarting."
</p>

<p>
We reached the gate in the court barrier, and I had to break character
for a moment to fiddle with the latch.  It took a moment to work it
with one hand while holding the heavy crossbow braced with the other,
especially since I was trying to hide how much I was straining to
support the heavy weapon with my off hand.  Finally, I got the gate
open and we swept through, sidling to the defendants' table.
</p>

<p>
"Y'all want to get out of here safe and sound and gain a whole crapton
of levels, enough to make you Archmagi?" I asked them in a jailyard
whisper.  "Gain levels, and be surrounded by warriors who think you're
the greatest thing since fire and will do anything to protect you?  If
so, go along with what I say."
</p>

<p>
Micrometric nods and carefully hidden fear-of-crazy-person were my
only response, which suited me just fine.
</p>

<p>
When I had discovered that I needed to stage a rescue from the middle
of a trial, a trickle of memories from my world had squirted before my
eyes.  Instantly, I knew there was only one way I could possibly do
the rescue.  No, it wasn't the 'right' way, and it was going to cause
me problems later, but I couldn't help myself.  When was I ever going
to have the chance to live this moment if I didn't seize it with both
hands when it presented itself?!  Surely this wacky universe could
give me this much.
</p>

<p>
Thomas had balked at first, since this would come perilously close to
trampling on the Writ, which held higher priority for him than my
orders.  It had taken some fast talking, a lot of promises, and even
some mild begging before he agreed to go along, but he finally had.
</p>

<p>
The hardest part had been convincing him that the two of us had to go
in alone.  He had nearly tied me to a chair when he heard that one,
but I had begged, pleaded, promised that we wouldn't really break the
Writ, and finally flat out lied about how it needed to happen this way
as part of the preliminary stages of a complex mystic ritual that
would result in the protection of Flobovia, no really, honest!  I'm
pretty sure he didn't believe a word of my 'mystic ritual' baloney,
but eventually he had grumbled and agreed.  There were, of course,
some provisos: two dozen Landguard, including the hulking Alpha Squad,
were just outside the door.  If Thomas decided things were too dicey,
I would be spirited out of here at warp speed, magic in the area would
be locked down, and everyone in this room who looked even remotely
hostile would be cut in half before they could blink.
</p>

<p>
I turned to face Lady Justice, slinging my crossbow as I spoke.  "Your
Honor, I'm not sure what verdict you were about to pronounce, but I
hope in all sincerity that you were about to declare these men
guilty."
</p>

<p>
She blinked at that, and settled back in her throne.  A lot of the
tension went out of her as she realized that I wasn't actually here to
contravene her will.
</p>

<p>
"Cut 'em loose," I told Thomas.
</p>

<p>
Thomas looked startled.  The script I'd given him had run out after we
got past the gate; this demand was a surprise, and an unpleasant one.
</p>

<p>
"M'Lord, they're magi, they could&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yeah, but they're <em>our</em> magi, so cut 'em the hell loose," I
told him in a no-nonsense voice, wishing with all my heart that I
could rack the crossbow like a shotgun.  I couldn't help myself; the
giggles started slipping out and I had to fight to swallow them back
before more than a couple had escaped.  I made myself recover my
forceful expression as Thomas moved to obey.  Meanwhile, I turned to
face Lady Justice.
</p>

<p>
"Your Honor, here's the thing.  These men are clearly guilty, and the
level reduction that you've chosen as their punishment...it ain't
enough.  Level reduction is a temporary thing, and they'd eventually
recover from it.  Instead, I think they need to learn the importance
of proper relations with honest folk, and maybe have a little humble
pie on the side.  So here's what I propose: first off, they pay
reparations to the folk they harmed and apologize real pretty-like.
Then, we draft 'em into the army and put Geas locks on 'em so they
can't run away.  Once that's done, we send 'em off to a frozen, poorly
supplied place where they can spend every minute of every day fighting
against horrible evil monsters with noone but a bunch of soldiers to
keep 'em company and make sure they don't get killed before they've
suffered through every single minute of their punishment.  The accused
had the choice to be fine upstanding citizens in their lovely robes
and shiny hats&mdash;" everyone looked at me oddly, since the magi
weren't wearing hats&mdash;"and they chose to misbehave.  Well, if
they aim to misbehave, I say we let 'em misbehave in a way that serves
and protects the people they harmed.  What do you say, Your Honor?"
</p>

<p>
She sat back on her throne, a tiny smile playing around her lips as
she recognized what I was doing.  She got to have her cake and eat it
too: the magi in question would be harshly punished, thereby showing
the Association that they weren't above the law but&mdash;even
better!&mdash;any backlash from the Association would land on me, not
on her or her Justiciars.  After all, hadn't I highhandedly stormed in
and usurped her authority?
</p>

<p>
"Yours is a far harsher punishment than this Court had intended to
pass, My Lord.  The Court had decided to reduce their sentence to a
fine and a short term in jail," she responded, shaking her head
portentiously as she lied through her teeth.  "That said, you are the
ruler of Flobovia, and if it is your will that these men be treated
so, then this Court cannot lawfully protest.  Since you will it,
M'Lord, the Court shall agree.  Wardens, take these men to the back
and have the Geas sealed on them.  The clerics are waiting."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Your Honor.  That's right decent of you," I told her with
a respectful nod.  I turned to face the Association.  "If anyone here
has a problem with this ruling, you just step right up.  There's an
acre of those monsters to go around, and I'd be happy to send you to
fight 'em if you care to disrespect me or mine."
</p>

<p>
There was dead silence, and I couldn't help rolling my eyes.  For a
profession that was based on intelligence, these guys were a little
slow.  "Good to see that none of you want to have the experience of
fighting monsters every day while surrounded by uncouth soldiers.
Now, since noone here cares to stand up and object to this court's
decision&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
One of the magi in the gallery jumped to his feet.  "I object!"  I
sighed in relief; <em>finally</em>, he got it!  I still needed a
little more to make it look good.
</p>

<p>
"You object, huh?  And what exactly might you be objecting to,
mister?"
</p>

<p>
He seemed a little taken aback at that; clearly, he hadn't expected to
need to give details.  Fortunately he rallied quickly.  "I object to
your highhanded ways!  You can't disrespect a court of law like this
you...uh...you extradimensional freak!"
</p>

<p>
I raised an eyebrow.  "Did you just call me an 'extradimensional
freak?'  That sounds like an insult to the throne.  Don't that sound
like an insult to the throne, Thomas?"
</p>

<p>
"That it does, sir," he responded tightly, again reciting from the
lines I'd fed him in advance.  He might not know why I was insisting
he use these particular words, but he was willing to go along.  My
inner fanboy jumped up and down and went squeeeeeeee!  Not only had I
managed to recover a few memories, but these memories were just made
of awesome and covered in awesome sauce with a serving of awesome on
the side...and I actually got to reenact them with me as the star!
Say what you will about my current situation but, just occasionally,
life was <em>really</em> good to me.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my fine sir, it would appear that you're going to be joining
your friends in the Army.  Thomas, take this man into custody.  If he
resists, kill him. You know, politely."  
</p>

<p>
Thomas whistled and Alpha Squad advanced into the room; apparently the
Landguard had some kind of whistle-code, because this was apparently
the whistle meaning "gentlemen, I would appreciate it if you would
come here for a moment, but don't worry, it is not required that you
kill anyone."  As Alpha Squad entered, they weren't by any means
'sauntering' but they also weren't 'racing through the room like
overclocked blenders.'  Perhaps the best word was 'stalked.'  They had
their hands on their weapons but hadn't actually drawn; they were
keeping their eyes all around, but weren't actually in
'Back-to-Back-Badass' mode.  Despite that, they were still, on
average, six foot five, two hundred and fifty pounds of pure muscle,
and marching perfectly in step so that each footfall crashed down with
a loud, implacable roar. It was an impressive display of understated
intimidation, and the room got very quiet as they entered.
</p>

<p>
My friend the new volunteer got especially quiet and a mite wide-eyed
as he watched them approach.  As a general rule, a normal fighter is
no threat to a mid- or high-level mage, but the Landguard were an
entirely different question.  With their numbers, training, Anti-Magic
swords, superhuman speed and strength, and whatever other secrets they
had hidden up their armored sleeves, they presented a threat that even
Archmagi had to take seriously.
</p>

<p>
The Landguard marched up to the 'volunteer' and halted, moving exactly
in sync so that after the final footfall there was echoing silence.
Robert nodded to the mage and nodded towards the door in the back of
the room, where the Wardens had taken the five accused.  "After you,
sir."  It was not a suggestion.
</p>

<p>
Hoping not to lose the momentum, I called to Alpha Squad.  "Gentlemen,
treat him politely and don't touch him so long as he goes willingly.
Now, as to the rest of you, I'm glad to see that you're sensible
enough not to join your friend here as he faces these monsters, with
all that that entails.  Since that's the case, I suppose we're done
here."
</p>

<p>
My words were the pebble that set off an avalance.  One after another,
magi from the gallery stood up, clamoring their "protests" at being
denied the opportunity to gain tremendous numbers of experience
points&mdash;and, therefore, <em>levels</em>&mdash;while being closely
guarded by an army.  In the end, there was a handful of magi still in
their seats, with the rest on their feet calling out mild imprecations
at me.  Some of them were quite hilarious; I've never actually been
called a 'pootyhead' before.
</p>

<p>
More Landguard came in to escort them away to get their Geas spells
and subsequent level increases. I'm sure the Geases were an
unappealing part of the idea, and probably what had made them
hesitate, but once they realized that this guy would end up surpassing
them in level as he fought the monsters, they couldn't resist jumping
on board.
</p>

<p>
I tucked one thumb into the collar of my coat and rocked back and
forth on my heels, a satisfied smile on my face.
