</p>

<p><em>Here's a second chapter for you this week, because the previous
one was so short.  R&R gratefully accepted.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Nothing is worse than death.  But resurrection sucks pretty hard
too.</p>

<p>Your mind returns first; this is a problem if the cause of your
death was the fact that you'd been turned into a charcoal briquette.
Your lungs are burned to tatters, so you can't scream and you
immediately start suffocating.  When you died your skin was
flash-fried, your eyes were boiled away, your eardrums were burst, and
your nasal passages were burned to ash; as you return you can't feel,
see, hear, or smell anything...total sensory deprivation, except for
the pain.  And worst of all&mdash;at least if the fire was as hot as
the one that killed me&mdash;large parts of your brain were cooked
like a pot roast.  So when you come back and start thinking again, you
can't do it very well.  In fact, you can think just well enough to
recognize that you can no longer think well.  That you are, in fact,
brain damaged.
</p>

<p>If all your life you've been a geek, a person whose entire sense of
self-worth and self-identity is based on the strength of his
intellect, on his ability to know and learn and deduce and remember, a
person who delights in word play and puns...if you are that person,
then there is no more horrifying fate than recognizing you've been
reduced to the level of a low-grade moron.  The Devil himself, in a
billion years of pondering, could not come up with a worse hell.
</p>

<p>
No, that's wrong.  That's <em>not</em> the worst.  The worst is that,
even as the magic heals all the damage done to you, you know that you
will remember this moment forever.  You will always remember exactly
what death and brain damage feel like.  And those memories will erupt
into your dreams every single night for the rest of your life...and
also into your waking moments.
</p>

<p>
After a time the magic finally caught up with all the damage and I
found myself conscious, no longer in pain, and lying on cushions in
the Work Room.  Around me stood the Archpriest, two of his
subordinates, seven Landguardsmen that I didn't recognize, and Thomas.
</p>

<p>
It was a long moment before I could find any words.  "So...I guess we
won?" 
</p>

<p>
Thomas nodded slowly.  "We used your lightning weapon to electrify the
point where they were appearing.  As they appeared, they fell.  After
a while, they stopped appearing.  At that point we had enough men to
stop the rest...barely.  There were several thousand of them through
the portal at that point, and many of them had made it off the Plaza
and into the city proper.  There was a lot of damage."
</p>

<p>
"How many survivors?"
</p>

<p>
He took a deep breath, looking sad.  "When the attack began, we had
seven hundred and twenty-four regulars on the square, two hundred and
twenty-eight Landguard, one hundred and four mages of various levels,
and one hundred and eighty seven mage apprentices.  Eight of the
regulars are still alive, along with forty three of the mages and
sixty eight of the apprentices."
</p>

<p>
I digested that.  "And the Landguard?"
</p>

<p>
With his face completely blank, he made a small gesture around the
room. 
</p>

<p>
I blinked.  He couldn't mean...?  "You're kidding.  This is all of the
surviving Landguard?"
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.  "No.  The rest are in the provinces.  They're on
their way back, but it'll take a couple of days for them to get here.
We're all that's left in the capital; we lost over ten percent of the
entire Landguard in this one attack.  There's no way we could stop
another like it."
</p>

<p>
When you've just come back from the dead, it's really not fair for
something to happen that gives you an immediate heart attack, even if
it's only metaphorical.  Actually, it was more like a brain-attack; my
brain crashed hard and yanked the power cord right out of the wall to
protect itself.
</p>

<p>
There was no way to stop an enemy who could teleport huge masses of
men directly into the capital.  No way at all, period, end of
sentence, done deal.  I was going to die.  For real this time.  No
resurrections, no heroic rescues or cheating-death-at-the-last minute.
I was going to flat out die.  I would never see home again.  My
parents would never know what happened to me, would never have any
kind of closure.  My friends would assume I vanished and didn't bother
staying in touch.  My landlord would eventually come into the
apartment to evict me and find me gone; he'd either take my computers
for himself or sell them.  Either way, all my private information
would end up public.
</p>

<p>
Some tiny little part of me recognized just how ridiculous that last
fear was; the rest of me grabbed that hint of self-awareness and held
onto it like a lifeline.  From there, I managed to slowly pull myself
up that slender rope, bootstrapping my way back to sentience.
</p>

<p>
I took a few deep breaths to calm down, forcing my shoulders to relax
a little further with each breath.  I focused all my attention on the
tip of my tongue; it's a really stupid trick, but it works.  It's
impossible to worry about pretty much anything while you're thinking
about the tip of your tongue; it starts feeling weird and becomes very
distracting.
</p>

<p>
Once I was breathing a little easier, I climbed to my feet and looked
at the Archpriest.
</p>

<p>
"How long was I...down?"  I asked, substituing a nicer word for
'dead' because I couldn't face the real one.  
</p>

<p>
He quirked a lip at my choice of words.  "About four hours.  We
weren't able to get you off the battlefield until the battle ended,
which took about three hours.  Then it took about an hour to get you
to the castle and get us all here."
</p>

<p>
I nodded, a bit stunned.  "We can't&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Thomas broke in.  "I would imagine that being dead has been draining,
My Lord.  Why don't we get some food while we discuss what to do
next?"  
</p>

<p>
I stared at him for a moment before realizing that what he was
actually saying was "shut the hell up before you say something that
will wreck everyone's morale."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Commander, that would be perfect."  He gave a tiny, ironic
bow and gestured for me to precede him out of the room.  I took the
hint. 
</p>

<p>
Thomas was stretching his legs, walking just a bit faster than the
others who had followed us out of the room.  I kept pace with him,
my long legs letting me keep from having to trot to keep up.
</p>

<p>
"We can resurrect the other Landguard, right?  And once they're back
we can hold the city."
</p>

<p>
He looked sideways at me for a moment, his lips twisted in repressed
anger.  "Eventually, yes.  There are two clerics in the city who can
cast <em>True Resurrection</em>, twelve who can
cast <em>Resurrection</em>, forty-one who can cast <em>Raise
Dead</em>, and various numbers at the intervening levels. Higher level
spell slots can be used for lower level spells, so the eighth and
sixth level slots can also be filled with resurrection magic.
</p>

<p>
"Given those numbers, if we had all of those clerics do nothing but
raise the Landguard we could theoretically have all of them back on
their feet in twenty-four hours.  Most of them would lose a level in
the process, but that's better than being dead.  The problem is that
the majority of them would have to be brought back with Raise Dead,
which requires that the body be whole; the Deorsi made a point of
decapitating all the bodies, presumably to make it harder for us to
raise them.  That means we can only bring back about forty Landguard
per day; it would take more than five days to bring them all back, and
I doubt the Deorsi will give us that much time. Plus, we can't start
until tomorrow, because most clerics don't normally memorize
resurrection magic; there isn't nearly as much call for it as for
healing and curing disease."
</p>

<p>
"Oh,"  I said, daunted.  "We're totally boned, aren't we?  We only
stopped this attack because we happened to have a major military
presence right on top of where the Deorsi started teleporting in.  We
can't count on that next time, and we can't stop them if they can
teleport in anywhere.  We need to evacuate; maybe if we can get the
people through the Elfhame the Deorsi won't follow.  After all, they
don't care about genocide, they just want to conquer Flobovia.  Once
everyone is safe, we can try to figure something out."
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.  "We aren't done yet.  I talked to the Archmagi,
and we have a plan.  We can stop the Deorsi if they send in troops
again&mdash;at least we can if we can spot them arriving soon enough.
We don't have a good plan for that though.  It's going to require some
luck, which I don't like."
</p>

<p>
He started explaining the plan; by the time we arrived at the sitting
room I was grinning like a shark.
</p>

<p>
Walking through the doors, I took up my usual spot (I was beginning to
regard this as my own personal living room) and turned to the
Archmagi, already seated and waiting across from me.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," I greeted them.  They nodded in response and we all got
settled.  (Although, speaking of settled, it was decidedly UNsettling
to have Thomas and two other Landguard take up station behind and
beside my chair, live steel in each hand.)
</p>

<p>
"Commander Thomas has filled me in on the current situation, and I
love your plan.  We just need to figure out how to locate where they
are teleporting in and get the troops there in time."
</p>

<p>
Isaac preened at my compliment; clearly, he thought that he deserved a
lot of the credit (if not all the credit) for coming up with this
idea.  Who knows, it might even be true. "Yes, My Lord.  That is
exactly the problem we were discussing when you arrived.  Since
clearly, standard warding methodology is poorly suited to the existing
situation, we will create a new technique. Which is easier said than
done."
</p>

<p>
I perked up at the mention of wards.  "What were you saying about
wards?  How hard would it be to ward the entire city?"
</p>

<p>
Isaac shook his head ponderously.  "My Lord, the connection of the
Prime Material to the Astral is ubiquitous and highly bounden,
mystically speaking.  The only spells that can disrupt that connection
have insufficient&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, we can't," say Reynard, talking over his compatriot.  Matthew
nodded in solemn agreement.  "There are two spells that can block
teleportation&mdash;Forbiddance and Dimensional Lock&mdash;but they only
cover a few square yards."
</p>

<p>
Isaac harumphed and crossed his arms, glaring at his peer.  Clearly,
he was unhappy about being interrupted.  I really didn't care right
now.
</p>

<p>
"Ok.  Other than those spells, what stops a teleportation?"
</p>

<p>
Isaac and Reynard shook their heads sadly.  "Nothing, My Lord," said
Reynard, just as Isaac said "A Teleport spell is a most efficacious
means to create an Astral tensor that will bridge between two&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A location error in the teleport, or the spell failing entirely," said
Matthew.  Everyone looked startled at hearing him speak; those were
the first words out of his mouth since I'd arrived in this wacky
world. 
</p>

<p>
"Ok, can we force an error, or a failure?" I demanded, starting to
feel the slightest twinge of hope. 
</p>

<p>
He frowned, concentrating.  "Well..." he said slowly.  "There's no way
to force an error that I know of.  But some effects, like Greater
Teleport, fail if the actual destination is too different from how you
picture it.  And if there's a wall or other object in the spot that
you're teleporting into, most teleportation effects will either fail
or shunt you to the nearest open area.  Some don't though, so they
would actually let you teleport into a solid object."
</p>

<p>
Isaac jumped in the moment that Matthew paused.  "Of course there are
ways to induce error!  What about Teleportation Trap?  It's
specifically intended to exchange the arrival locus of a Tenser bridge
with another spatial locus!  And the Anticipate Teleportation series
will also interfere with the attachment of the bridge, causing an
error in the temporal dimension."
</p>

<p>
That caught my interest, and I flipped through the Brainopedia.  A
seventh level spell, Teleportation Trap belonged to wizards and
sorcerers.  Anyone teleporting into the area of effect was redirected
to a location of the caster's choosing, which had to be open and on a
solid surface.  It didn't say how big a surface though, so a giant
metal spike would work as an arrival point.
</p>

<p>
No, that wouldn't do it.  The first person teleported, maybe the first
two or three, would be killed by the spike, but their bodies would
cover up the spike and allow the rest to come through safely.  What we
needed was a way to kill all those coming through the portal, but
remove their bodies quickly so that the ones behind them kept coming
through without knowing there was a problem.  Maybe a killing ground
with a crossfire of cannon?  The cannon would blow the fragments back,
opening up space for more victims&hellip;.
</p>

<p>
"Teleport Trap sounds like what we need.  We can divert them somewhere
and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Reynard was shaking his head.  "Won't work.  Teleport Trap has a ten
minute casting time; by the time we found where they were appearing,
we wouldn't have time to set up the trap."
</p>

<p>
I was determined to make this work; it was such a beautiful idea.
"What about Time Stop or Haste, to let you cast the spell faster?"
</p>

<p>
Isaac stepped up to the plate on this one, determined to grab the
limelight again.  "Unfortunately, M'Lord, that strategy will be
ineffective, due to the maximum temporal flux capacity of the Time
Stop dweomer which, in accordance with Elminister's Third Postulate,
is inadequate to contain a level of charge adequate to sustain the
effect for more than a few&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I cut in quickly.  "Ok, gotcha, it won't work.  Haste?"
</p>

<p>
Matthew shook his head and I didn't even bother asking for the
explanation; it had been a long shot anyway. 
</p>

<p>
I was flipping frantically through the Brainopedia, trying to find any
way to make this work, because if we couldn't I was pretty sure we
were all toast.  Magic items?  Spells?  There had to be something...we
needed to be able to cast the spell fast enough, but we had to also be
able to get the caster to the right place fast enough.  How, how,
how??? 
</p>

<p>
"Ahem!  As I was <em>saying</em>," Isaac put in with a distinct sniff.
"The obvious solution for this issue would be to construct the
Astral linkage either by means of a more powerful mystic field with a
lower activation energy or via a reified spell field."
</p>

<p>
I stared at him for a long minute, trying to figure out what the hell
he had just said.  I was pretty sure it was important, so it was
irritating that he had picked that exact moment to start speaking
Martian.  
</p>

<p>And then the light dawned&hellip;.</p>
