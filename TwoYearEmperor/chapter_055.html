<em><strong>Author's Note</strong>:  Still don't own D&D.</em>
</p>


<p>
<em><strong>Author's Note #2:</strong> Until September 21, 2014 I am
on the opposite side of the International Date Line from normal.  As
such, you are probably seeing this update on a different day than
normal.  Updates still happen on Saturday of whatever time zone I'm in
at the time.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em><strong>Author's Note #3:</strong> Don't forget that chapter 54
was an omake (it did not really happen, it was just a 'what if'), so
this chapter actually follows the end of chapter 53.</em>
</p>

<hr />

<p>
I sighed.  "Fine, let's back up and make sure we've caught everything.
Anyone notice anything else from what he's been talking about?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas frowned.  "What was it he said earlier, about Afi's Ice
Assassin?  About the scrying...."
</p>

<p>
"Here you are, Commander," Suze said, reaching forward to hand him a
sheet of paper.  We all leaned in to see what was on it; eyebrows went
up as we found ourselves looking at a word-for-word copy of everything
that had been said since Loki appeared, all written in a neat,
feminine hand.
</p>

<p>
All eyes turned to Suze; she ducked her head a little but did not
shrink into her seat this time.
</p>

<p>
"Suze, this is amazing," I told her frankly.  "I didn't ask you to do
this...."
</p>

<p>
She smiled shyly.  "I thought it might help to have a record, M'Lord.
You know, so that you can give the information to other people without
having to recite it yourselves?"
</p>

<p>
I grinned and turned to fully face her.  "The memory maiden to the
rescue!  I hereby promote thee to the rank of Imperial Executive
Assistant, Order of the Golden Pen!  Arise, Dame Suze!" With extended
index finger, I tapped her ceremoniously on each shoulder.  She
blushed, but looked pleased.
</p>

<p>
Thomas watched my antics with a small smile, then turned back to
reviewing the transcript.  "Here it is," he said, jabbing his thick
finger partway down.  "Afi can only scry on his thing when he's within
a mile of it.  Loki said that Afi was able to use Scry Location on us
because the Ice Assassin saw this place.  That means that Afi himself
must have been nearby."
</p>

<p>
Well, that didn't put a damper on the mood or anything.
</p>

<p>
"If he was here...why didn't he just kill us all?" asked Unn in
confusion.  "Instead of coming here himself, he could have used a
Teleportation Circle to send in one of his Legions and overrun us.
Especially if he's found a way to bypass our warders...."
</p>

<p>
"How <em>did</em> that work, anyway?" I asked curiously.  I flipped
through the Brainopedia, looking for the spells that Loki had
mentioned.  When I found the answer I started laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's just <em>wrong,</em>" I snickered.  "Mind Blank prevents
divinations from working on the subject.  True Seeing is a divination,
so Mind Blank keeps it from seeing the user if he's under
Invisibility."
</p>

<p>
Unn was grumbling under her breath.  "Most wizards don't know that
trick; the Academy has worked hard to keep it quiet.  We figured that
Afi might know it, so we put up Invisible nets to prevent him just
walking in."
</p>

<p>
My smile was a little bit twisted; I had to admire Afi's brilliance,
although I didn't like the fact that it was aimed at killing me.  "So
he probably came in with a True Seeing of his own so that he could see
the net, then teleported past it, or Shapechanged into an ant and
walked under it, or something like that.  Anyway, he did it.  His Ice
Assassin got in here, Afi looked around, and <em>bam!</em> we're
open."
</p>

<p>
"It won't matter too much," Albrecht put in.  "What he saw is the
existing layout of the corridors and <em>this particular</em> instance
of this particular Magnificent Mansion.  It'll run out in a few hours
and we'll cast another one.  Even if it looks exactly the same, it
will still be an entirely different plane and he'll need to get
another look at it before he can scry us again.  As to the corridors,
we'll shift those around; we can keep the same layout but, as long as
the Holes are connected in different sequence, it'll be outside his
ability to scry without getting another look."
</p>

<p>
He gave a harumph of annoyance.  "As to him getting another
look...we'll just have to step up security a bit.  Excuse me."  He
scribbled some orders on a piece of paper and ducked out into the hall
to hand it to someone.  Moments later, he was back.
</p>


<p>
"Thank you, Loki," I said, completely sincerely.  "I know it wasn't
easy for you to be so straightforward, but we really are grateful."
</p>

<p>
He gave a pleased grumble and went back to watching his portable TV.
He was polite enough to use earbuds, at least.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, what else?" I asked, trying to move the focus back to what I
viewed as the important point.  "Anyone?  Suze, Alpha Squad, if you
have anything, chime in."
</p>

<p>
We all turned our eyes to the until-now-silent occupants of the room.
</p>

<p>
For a moment they all looked wildly uncomfortable, but eventually
Aerith spoke up.  "The colors seemed like the important part to me,
M'Lords and Ladies.  Why were His Majesty's colors like that, and what
about the black flames and the normal-colored flames?"
</p>

<p>
"Hm," I hm'd.  My brain wasn't spitting out an answer as fast as I
would have liked, so I dispatched a slug of Scotch to lubricate the
gears.  "Mine wass probibly weird because I'm a real person, and
outside your alignment system," I said thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"My assumption," Drifa began, speaking thoughtfully.  "Was that the
black flames were the basic color of the ritual...that they were the
outward expression of the matrix that absorbs the sacrifices and
converts them into the shell we're building for the Lady.  The red
flames would have represented a minor flaw in the ritual, a brief
disruption after absorbing a sacrifice large enough to disturb the
matrix."
</p>

<p>
The word 'matrix' brought a memory bubbling up from my
carefully-locked-away subconscious.  <em>"The arcane matrix of a
Polymorph Any Object spell is constructed using a Kafkan
transformation field interleaved with a Delphic information-gathering
matrix...,"</em> whispered the pompous voice of Isaac, immediately
followed by a mushroom cloud blowing the top off Mount Herabu and
vaporizing a man who had been loyal and proud to serve.
</p>

<p>
One panic attack and one Calm Emotions spell later, I was beginning to
feel like something out of a Looney Tunes...something like the poor
guy standing between a doctor with a Heal-O-Matic and a villain with a
Mega-Bonkulator.  "He's up!  He's down! He's up!  He's down!  He's up!
He's down!"  I sent eighty or ninety thousand dollars worth of Scotch
to shore up the defenses against such memories.  I was fine now, of
course, thanks to that never-to-be-sufficiently-praised Calm Emotions
spell, but it seemed like a good idea to deploy some defenders in
advance.
</p>

<p>
"By the way," I said, raising a finger in emphasis.  "I've been
forgetting suthing verr important.  Things have been so nuts, what
with the oceans of undead, an the eyeball stabbing an the gods an
the whatnot.  I've been forgetting, and tha's a verry bad thing."
</p>

<p>
I nodded decisively, pleased with how efficiently I had conveyed my
point, and took a sip of Scotch in celebration.  Looking around, I was
suprised to find that everyone was looking at me expectantly.
</p>

<p>
"What have you been forgetting, Jake?" Thomas asked patiently.  He
reached for my bottle and I absently moved it out of his reach.
</p>

<p>
"Isaac and Reynard, an all the Languard who died on th way in here,"
I told him, confused at why I had to repeat this.  "We need to get
them rezrrected.  Drifa, could you plis handle that?"
</p>

<p>
She looked uncomfortable.  "I <em>can</em>, Your Majesty...but it
might be better if I didn't."
</p>

<p>
I raised an eyebrow at her.  "Whahuh?"  I took a sip on my Scotch and
was surprised to find the cup empty.  Shrugging, I filled it up again
and <em>then</em> took my sip.  And another, just to keep it company.
For some reason, Thomas got a pained expression when I did.
</p>

<p>
"Well," she began, looking more uncomfortable by the minute.
"We <em>can</em> still do resurrection magic, of course, but it's
started being...unwise.  For the last year, every time we've
resurrected someone, there's been...issues.  Sometimes the dark gods
have used the resurrection channel as a way to slip something into our
world."
</p>

<p>
"Huh," I said, a bit owlishly.  <em>Resurrection sucks pretty hard.
Suffocating...lungs burned to tatters.  Eyes boiled, skin fried,
eardrums burst, nasal passages scorched&mdash;total sensory
deprivation.  Brain was cooked like a pot roast...going to be stupid
forever, just smart enough to know you're stupid....</em>
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, we were at the tail end of the Calm Emotions spell when
those memories word-associated through my brain.  I quickly sent a
warhammer of Scotch to break up the images so that I wouldn't have to
deal with them when the time ran out in another twelve seconds.  With
valiant cries, my golden Scotch warriors charged to battle, burying my
enemies in a pleasantly warm haze.  It was nice.
</p>

<p>
"And, sometimes it's worse," Drifa continued, oblivious to my mental
issues.  "Sometimes the dark gods have done things to people's souls,
in the afterlife.  Sometimes the people come back...wrong."
</p>

<p>
I must have been pretty tired, because things seemed a little foggy
and my head felt wobbly.  I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes so I could
focus on Drifa.
</p>

<p>
"Thash definitely na good, then," I declared firmly, making an effort
to speak clearly through the sleep haze.  (It <em>was</em> sleep haze.
Really.  Honest.)  "We pro'lly shouldn't do that."
</p>

<p>
Thomas sighed and tipped his head in a signal to Rob.  Rob's hand came
down on my shoulder and he said "Neutralize Poison," in a voice that
told reality that yes, this <em>was</em> the way it was going to be.
</p>

<p>
My lovely, horrible-memory-suppressing alcohol haze disappeared
instantly, leaving all those aforementioned horrible memories of
burning to death and being resurrected but not actually resurrected
because the Landguard had to sacrifice their religion to a stuck up
tinpot egomaniac god in order to pull me through time and I repaid
them by conspiring with Albrecht to get them all killed which made
Thomas torture me and ohgodohgodohgod....
</p>

<p>
"Calm Emotions," Bob said, doing a lovely job of not sounding
exasperated or disapproving.
</p>

<p>
I sat up from my fetal hunch and calmly took another serving of the
fried bananas that Loki had summoned with the meal.  "Thanks, Bob.
Anyway, where were we?"
</p>

<p>
"Are you <em>sure</em> you don't want me to fix that, Your Majesty?"
Unn asked carefully.
</p>

<p>
I waved her off and kept enjoying the bananas.  "Nope.  No mucking with
my head.  I'll deal with the memories."
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty&mdash;Jake, you are <em>not</em> dealing with the
memories," Thomas told me gently.  "That's the problem.  It's getting
worse, and the booze isn't helping; you really need to lay off that
stuff.  Why don't you give me the bottle?" He reached out his hand
slowly, as though towards a skittish horse.
</p>

<p>
Without looking up, I moved the bottle to the side opposite him and
tucked it in the crook of my arm.  "I'm good, thanks.  I can handle
it; I'll just be more careful.  And besides, if I <em>do</em> get
hammered, Bob can always sober me up, right?  Easy peasy, no problem."
</p>

<p>
"Jake, I'm with Thomas on this one," Albrecht said quietly.  "You
really need to do something about these panic attacks.  I know you're
nervous about mind magic, but perhaps we could&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I looked up, eyebrow raised.  I couldn't be angry at the moment, but
there was no way I was letting Albrecht get away with that.  "What is
this, an intervention?  Forget it, you people are not screwing with my
head again.  It's <em>not happening,</em> so stop suggesting it.  Now,
we were talking about resurrections and why they're a bad idea.  Is
there anything we can do about it?"
</p>

<p>
Uncomfortable silence reigned for several rounds as everyone resisted
the topic change.  I stared at them, calmly (of course) waiting for an
answer.
</p>

<p>
"I...don't think so," Drifa finally answered.  "The gods won't
actually deny mortals access to spells or stop us from using them; if
Neklos were to outright deny me the ability to use True Resurrection,
the Overgods would crush him like a bug.  And usually they
don't...interefere with things.  Right now though, with all the chaos
in the world, it seems like some of the rules are being bent a
little."
</p>

<p>
Loki snorted, not looking up from the bucket of fried chicken he was
chomping on.  (No, really&mdash;he was eating <em>the bucket</em>, not
the chicken.)  "'Being bent' if generof," he told us, cheeks packed
full of cardboard.  He chewed and gulped down the mouthful; I watched
it distend its way through his throat and eventually disappear into
his belly.  There was something very disturbing about it.
</p>

<p>
We all waited patiently for him to continue, but he just went back to
eating his bucket, tossing the chicken over his head so he could get
at the cardboard better.  (The various bits of chicken repeatedly
reassembled themselves into clucking reddish-brown hens, which
promptly disappeared.)
</p>

<p>
"Um...yes," Drifa said, nonplussed at the sight of Loki's antics.
Clearly, she had not spent enough time around him if this was
registering on her Weird-o-meter.  "In any case...there's nothing that
we can do to change what Neklos is doing with the resurrections.  We
can bring people back if it's important enough, but it's usually a
good idea to use Programmed Amnesia on them afterwards, to make sure
that their minds are put back the way they should be.  And, sometimes
the, soul-riders can be an issue."
</p>

<p>
I nodded, carefully focusing on this as an abstract problem instead of
thinking about that whole 'death' and 'resurrection' and 'brain was
cooked' thing which I absolutely was not thinking about at the moment,
nope, definitely not.
</p>

<p>
"What's a 'soul-rider'?  Something that hitchhikes back on the
person's soul?  What sort of thing are we talking about?" I asked
carefully.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht shrugged.  "We've had different ones.  Sometimes it will be a
demon that rides along with the resurrection, using it like a reverse
Gate. Sometimes there will be a taint on the person's soul that works
like a communicable form of mummy rot.  Sometimes the dark gods have
modified the mind attached to the soul, so the one resurrected returns
as an agent of evil.  Sometimes...well, the list goes on.  The dark
gods are very creative, and Neklos in particular is both cruel and
evil."
</p>

<p>
"And terrible at chess," Loki added, not looking up from the game of
Pok&eacute;mon Emerald he was playing on his Trash80.  "I mean
seriously, the last time we played I gave him a rook and my king-queen
pawns and he still lost!  <em>A rook and the king-queen pawns!</em>
Honestly, how do you lose with an advantage like that?"
</p>

<p>
He paused to sip his Dr. Pepper, and then added, "He's also a sore
loser.  Really terrible.  Throws a hissy fit, even if you're nice
about it."  He put Pok&eacute;mon on pause and glanced at us with a
wicked smile.  "Although maybe I shouldn't have done the victory
dance.  Or chanted 'you suck, I rule' at him.  And the butt wiggling
may have been a bit over the top."
</p>

<p>
He paused, looking thoughtfully at the ceiling and tapping his chin.
"Yep.  Maybe over the top.  Still, blowing up an entire island?
Probably a bit of an overreaction."  
</p>

<p>
Without another word, he went back to having a holographic Bulbasaur
pummel Squirtle on a machine that had been the cutting edge when I was
in kindegarten.  The rest of us just watched him, then turned back to
our conversation, refusing to encourage him by giving him attention.
</p>

<p>
"I would really like to see Isaac and Reynard brought back," I told
Drifa, feeling a little embarrassed as I said it.  "I kinda owe them,
for tricking them into killing themselves, and I'd like to make it
right."  All of the Deorsi except Albrecht were suddenly looking
alarmed, so I hastened to reassure them.  "Don't worry, I was
psychotic at the time, but now I'm not."
</p>

<p>
The faces around me showed a remarkable lack of reassurance.
</p>

<p>
I sighed.  "Look, this is why I'm so down on mind-editing spells.
When I got here, Isaac, Reynard, and Matthew decided that I needed to
be a better warlord, so they edited my brain.  Took out fear,
embarrassment...anything that might get in the way of me ruthlessly
killing all of Flobovia's enemies.  They cranked up the 'ruthless'
part a little too high, though; when I figured out what they had done,
I started planning how to kill them off and, um, how to kill off the
Landguard for allowing it."  I ducked my head a little as I glanced
over at Thomas; he didn't react.
</p>

<p>
"Anyway," I hastened to add.  "I tricked Isaac and Reynard into
blowing themselves up, I banished Matthew to the furthest outpost in
Flobovia&mdash;speaking of, Thomas, send a Sending to tell him he can
come home.  After all that, I talked with Albrecht about getting the
Landguard killed."  All of the Deorsi, again except for Albrecht,
looked at Thomas with wide eyes, then looked back at me.  "We never
actually did anything about it," I hastened to add.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht raised an eyebrow.  "Of course I did.  You don't think we
teleported into the middle of all those drauga by accident, do you?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas turned an icy gaze on him; a raised eyebrow invited further
detail.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht just ignored Thomas's death glare and met his gaze calmly.
"I made a formal treaty between nations.  Part of my duties under that
treaty were to get the Landguard killed.  It would have been easy
enough to load all of us onto flying carpets and use Teleportation
Circle to appear a few miles above the city, then fly straight down.
Instead, I sent all of you in on foot and waited until you'd taken
enough casualties before my men and I pitched in."
</p>

<p>
The faint jingling of chain mail echoed through the room as Alpha
Squad shifted their weight.  The expression on Thomas's face was
drifting back into that sheer blankness that he'd had when he stabbed
Albrecht in the eye.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht shrugged casually, taking a spoonful more of the coconut
pudding. "I'm telling you this now so that it doesn't come out at a
less convenient time later."  He finished his pudding, licked the
spoon clean, and turned back to Thomas.
</p>

<p>
"Understand this," he told the Landguard leader.  "I keep my deals,
period.  At that time, getting you all killed was part of the deal I'd
made.  <em>Now,</em> keeping you alive is part of my new deal.  Do you
have a problem with that, Commander?"
</p>

<p>
The silence creaked by like the wheels on a death cart. I could almost
hear someone in the background chanting 'Bring out your dead!  Bring
out your dead!'...and not in the funny Monty Python way, either.  Much
more the actual "hey, two thirds of the population of Europe just
dropped dead with seizures and gangrene.  Throw the bodies on the cart
so we can burn 'em before anyone else gets sick" sort of way.
</p>

<p>
"No.  No problem," Thomas finally ground out.  He considered Albrecht
for another moment, looking as though he was measuring him for a
coffin.  "What about the resurrection issue?  When you blackmailed us
into annexing Anundj&aring;, you told us that you would make your
resurrection ability available to us."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht shrugged.  "I have.  What ability we have to resurrect people
is at your disposal.  I never said we had a <em>lot</em> of ability,
or that it was a good idea to use it."
</p>

<p>
The table creaked where Thomas's fingers gripped the edge; I heard the
faint <em>pop!</em> of wood starting to give way.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht's expression was suddenly just as lethal as Thomas's; the
geniality that he wore as a mask fell away to reveal the centuries-old
general and statesman.  Leaning in, he looked Thomas directly in the
eye.
</p>

<p>
"<em>I protect my people</em>, Commander," he asserted.
"<em>Whatever</em> that takes.  Yes, I have tricked and manipulated
you and your government since the moment we met.  I have lied to you,
deceived you, destroyed two of your cities and most of their
inhabitants, and gotten most of your men butchered by undead horrors.
And now, <em><strong>you</strong> are my people, and all of my skills
are turned to saving your ruler and your Land from an apocalypse</em>.
If you have a problem with me, do something about it now.  Otherwise,
stop acting like a petulant child and get over it."
</p>

<p>
The table's edge shattered in Thomas's fingers; aside from that, he
was still as a statue.  His face promised instant death to anyone who
spoke, moved, or even so much as hinted at thinking about breathing
too loudly.  Alpha Squad waited in the four corners of the room, hands
on their swords, ready and more than ready to butcher Albrecht and
anyone who got in the way at a single word from their Commander.
</p>

<p>
After several of the longest seconds of my life, Thomas let go a
shuddering breath and relaxed in his seat, placing the broken-off wood
on the table with exquisite gentleness.
</p>

<p>
"Can we safely resurrect Archmagi Isaac and Reynard?" he asked,
turning to Drifa with a tone of polite inquiry.  "They are both
intelligent and powerful, and would be a significant asset.  Also,
they are familiar with the Programmed Amnesia spell and could help to
cleanse the minds of other people we resurrect.  If we alternated
between resurrecting high priests and archmagi, could we get ahead of
the issues you've described?"
</p>

<p>
Drifa raised an eyebrow at Thomas's suddenly-calm affect but, seasoned
adventurer that she was, she rolled right by it.  "We can resurrect
them, yes.  We'll need to be very careful; they'll need to be rendered
unconscious instantly upon revival, and then we'll need to verify and
possibly correct their minds.  We'll need to do multiple scans to find
soul corruption, diseases, enchantments, and such.  We'll also want to
have a separate group of casters, divine and arcane, ready to contain
any creatures that ride back on their souls."
</p>

<p>
She paused to calculate.  "It will take about forty person-hours per
resurrection, and all of those people will need to be high level
personnel.  Even with all those precautions it still won't be entirely
safe.  Something could come back with them, then immediately Plane
Shift directly to Afi, or it could read an Explosive Runes bomb the
moment it appears."
</p>

<p>
Thomas gaze got a bit distant as he thought through the process. "Yes,
that makes sense.  We can help with a lot of that; I'll have a squad
onhand when you do the resurrection.  They'll have readied actions to
activate mage defense the instant the subject appears; that will drop
them, the subject, and any soul-riders into a single Portable Hole
where no magic or supernatural abilities work.  They can render the
subject unconscious and kill most riders quickly.  That will free up
some of your casters."
</p>

<p>
Drifa thought about that and nodded.  "Yes, that should work.  It
won't significantly reduce the time though; the casters who are there
to contain soul-riders are only needed for a few minutes.  The
majority of time is spent in the investigation and cleansing phases."
</p>

<p>
Turning to me, she continued.  "Your Majesty, I want to be very clear:
even with all of these precautions, this is not a safe procedure.  No
matter how much it would help increase our combat power, I strongly
suggest against beginning mass resurrections.  We've tried this route,
with all sorts of precautions; no matter how careful we are, about one
time in four we miss something.  And in every case where we miss
something, the results are very bad."
</p>

<p>
"Understood," I told her.  "Still, I would very much like to have
Isaac and Reynard back; I owe them big time.  If you think that you
can do it reasonably safely, please do.  But the final call is
yours&mdash;if you don't feel safe enough, we won't do it."  That was
a painful thing to say, but I'd always made it a policy not to gainsay
expert subordinates when they were talking about their chosen field.
</p>

<p>
"Cough, cough.  Questions?  Asking thereof?  Getting bored here," Loki
announced.  He was floating upside down, what looked like a graphic
novel magically suspended in front of his face.  I couldn't get a good
look, but it seemed to feature some sort of greenish blob monster
fighting marsupials.
</p>

<p>
"Right!  Sorry, give us just one more minute, please," I told him with
a guilty start.  We all went into a quick huddle, debating what to
ask next.
</p>

<p>
"I've got a list of questions that I'd like answered about this war,"
Albrecht offered, producing a thick sheaf of parchment from an inner
pocket.  "We could ask him 'what is the maximal set of numbers such
that every element of the set is the numerical index of a true
statement from the following list?'"
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.  "No go.  I tried something similar the last time he
and I played this game, and he treated all of the statements as
separate questions.  He gave me a discount because he was in a good
mood and liked the trick, but we don't have enough questions to burn
on something like that."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht looked disappointed but nodded acquiescence.  He left the
list of questions on the table, and I took a moment to skim through
the first few pages quickly.
</p>

<p>
"I think digging out more about the ritual should be the top
priority," Drifa suggested.  "If it's not going to work, we need to
relocate Gr&#491;fhamr now, before Afi's troops show up.  If it is,
then we need to know more about what Herr&uacute;n will be like when
she reifies."
</p>

<p>
Thomas was frowning.  "The military situation seems more immediately
important to me.  Afi has Legions standing by, ready to deploy.  He
knows where this place is; he could have dropped millions of undead on
us already, but he hasn't.  Why not?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht shrugged.  "They can't teleport closer than six miles; it
will take them an hour or two to march that distance.  We have a
little time yet.  We can push as many people through the ritual as
possible, and get as much information from Lord Loki"&mdash;he paused
to give the trickster god a polite nod&mdash;"and then decide if we
need to move Gr&#491;fhamr or not."
</p>

<p>
"Personally, I'm most interested in knowing more about the gods in
general," I put in.  "Why are they trying to wipe out the world?  Why
aren't the gods of life shutting down the undead?  Also, it seems
clear that there's a correlation between power of the god and number
of worshippers, but which way does that flow?  What exactly are the
limits on them, and why?  If this Neklos is driving the drauga's
expansion, is he pitching in?  If not, why not?  The gods are the root
cause of everything we're dealing with, so if you
want <em>strategic</em> information"&mdash;I gave Albrecht a
significant look&mdash;"then that's it."
</p>

<p>
"Seriously bored now, guys," Loki called, an edge coming into his voice.
</p>

<p>
"Sixty seconds, please!" I called.
</p>

<p>
The following sixty seconds was the fastest and most intense
conversation I've ever had but, eventually, we were ready.  The words
weren't polished, but I was keeping all of Unn's earlier advice in
mind and mentally reviewing what I was going to say.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, we're ready," I declared, breaking the huddle and turning to face
Loki.  He was currently being a zebra, but I didn't let that stop me.
</p>

<p>
I picked up the inkwell and took a deep breath, pondering my wording
carefully.  "I'd like to use one of the 'honest and complete'
questions, please."  I paused to review it again, licking my lips
nervously; I really did not want to screw this up.
</p>

<p>
"What is the set of words in a language that everyone at this table
understands that contains all the truths that we most need to know and
that you will award us for the cost of only a single question, sorted
by importance from most important to least important?"  This had
seemed just different enough from the 'which of these is true' that it
was worth taking a chance on.  And, worst case, it would only cost a
single question.
</p>

<p>
Loki stared at me, frowning and tapping one hoof in irritation.  I
gulped and carefully stared at his chin.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly his face lit up in a happy equine grin.  "Sure, no problem,"
he said, somehow forcing coherent speech out of a mouth that was never
intended for it.  "I'll even write it down for you for easy reference.
Here you go."  He reached into the pocket of his overalls and tossed
me an old-fashioned brass key.
</p>

<p>
Startled, I fumbled the catch and had to pick the key up from the
floor.  I turned it over in my hands, confused.
</p>

<p>
"What's this?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Look behind you," he said with a grin.  I glanced back; a wooden door
hovered, unsupported, two feet behind me.  It was painted white with
sky blue trim, and it had a large brass doorknob and keyhole, clearly
a match for the key in my hand.
</p>

<p>
Carefully, I got up and unlocked the door.  Thomas rose to stand
beside me but Loki gestured casually and he was slammed back into his
chair.
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry, it's safe," Loki said casually. Thomas struggled for a
moment and then sat, tensely watching me.
</p>

<p>
I opened the door and looked inside.  Behind the door was a room lit
by buzzing, flickering fluroescent lights.  Three tall bookcases
filled the room, leaving just enough room to slip between them.  The
shelves were jam packed with tomes, each a yard high and wide and at
least six inches thick. The impressiveness of the books was completely
overwhelmed, however, by the impressiveness of the room.  It went on,
and on, and on, receding farther and farther away until it hit the
vanishing point.  I was pretty sure it went on from there.
</p>

<p>
"These books contain everything you should know about everything
you've expressed interest in," Loki said smugly, leaning back in his
seat and crossing his arms.  "It's all here...the enemy, the gods,
whatever.  Enjoy."
</p>

<p>
I knew perfectly well that there was a catch, but I pulled down the
first volume from the first shelf and flipped it open.  Aside from the
margins, the pages were completely black.
</p>

<p>
I looked at Loki with an inquiring eyebrow, cocking the book so
everyone could see.  "What's this?" I asked again.
</p>

<p>
Loki's grin stretched so wide it met behind his ears.  "Well, there's
a lot of info!  I had to use a small font...I'm sure you can find an
electron microscope around here somewhere."  He snickered a bit.  "Oh,
I'm afraid it's a bit wordy.  That first volume you're holding there?
That contains the opening paragraph of the discussion about the nature
of the gods.  The rest is in the books from the next nine linear feet.
</p>

<p>
"And don't think about using Scholar's Touch or some other
speedreading magic," he told us, wagging a finger in disapproval.
"That room is an antimagic zone, and the books are immune to magic.
Still!  It's everything you asked for, Jake!  Honest, <em>very</em>
complete, and non-deceptive!  All of my juiciest info, laid out for
your perusal.  Enjoy!"  He crossed his legs, his grin so utterly smug
that it must have smugly cornered the market on smugness and
completely shut down the ability of anyone else in the entire
multiverse to look smug for the next century.
</p>

<p>
"Come on," he said, waving his hands in a Matrix-esque 'come and get
it' gesture.  "That was fun.  Be with the asking of your next one."
The scoreboard behind him dinged, leaving us with only six 'honest and
complete' answers.
</p>

<p>
I stepped out of the room and walked around a bit, watching over my
shoulder as the doorway kept a steady distance of two feet from me,
expanding the room whenever it needed space.
</p>

<p>
"Don't forget to lock up," Loki reminded me.  Shrugging, I put the key
in the lock and turned it; the door instantly vanished.  Suspecting
how this worked, I stuck the key into thin air and turned it the other
way; sure enough, the door reappeared and clicked open.
</p>

<p>
"Right, thanks," I said in disgruntlement.  I locked up again, resumed
my seat, and rolled my mug around in my hands, trying to think of the
next question.  At least he was in a good mood now.
</p>

<p>
I turned back to the others to figure out what to ask, only to be
interrupted by Loki's throat clearing.  "Like I said, bored now," he
told me sternly.  "If you want more questions answered, ask 'em
yourself.  I'm tired of waiting while all of you natter on."
</p>

<p>
I gulped and glanced at the others.  Unn made a 'well, go on!' gesture
at me, so I turned back to Loki and gathered my thoughts quickly.  It
didn't take long to figure out the right question.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to use a 'truthful but maybe deceptive' answer, please," I
told him.  It was a risk, but the question was simple and I hoped that
Loki wouldn't muck around too much.  Also, it would give him a break
from being so open, since that was obviously a problem for him.  I was
all in favor of anything that would put him in a better mood.
</p>

<p>
"If Afi was in here, he knows that we're doing the ritual," I began.
"He was probably able to Detect Thoughts the details out of someone,
so he probably knows what it's about, too.  Could he do the same
ritual himself and resurrect her in his own location, grateful to
him?"  It was important; I needed to know if we were in a race to
finish our ritual before he finished his.  And I figured that, if I
had the slightest idea that Loki got tricky with his answer, we could
always just discard what he said and burn an 'honest and complete'
question.
</p>

<p>
"Hm," Loki said, standing up so that he could pace back and forth,
hands clasped behind him in thought.  "Well, simply put, no.  Starting
a ritual like this requires abilities that undead simply don't have.
So, no, he can't do his own copy of this ritual on his own ground and
resurrect her before you finish yours, which is what I figure you
really wanted to know."  The scoreboard behind him went <em>ding!</em>
and decremented to '4'.
</p>

<p>
I digested that.  It seemed pretty straightforward, but
this <em>was</em> Loki.  I would accept the answer as evidence, but
assign a relatively high probability that there was something sketchy
about it.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to use another 'truthful but maybe deceptive' answer,
please.  Is the following statement true or false: the blackness of
the ritual fires represents some facet of the ritual magic itself, as
opposed to being caused by an externality."
</p>

<p>
Loki smiled.  "False," he told me, in an uncharacteristic display of
straightforwardness.  The board behind him <em>bing!</em>ed like the
horn of the apocalypse.
</p>

<p>
I went white as a sheet.  "Oh, crap...."
</p>

<p>
Loki bowed from his seat.  "Seems like you have some things to talk
about," he snickered.  "I'll leave you to it.  Tata!"  With a fanfare
of vuvuzelas in F# Major, he vanished.
</p>

<p>
This was definitely a leemer moment, but I forced my way through it
and turned to face the others.  "Albrecht, I think this is the time to
deploy that little surprise your apprentice magi have been taking care
of.  Like, <em>right now.</em>"
</p>

<p>
Everyone else had gotten it too, because they were looking just as
pale as I was.  Albrecht nodded jerkily.  "I'd say we should also try
unloading the Portable Holes.  First one, then the other."
</p>

<p>
It seemed like a good idea but, even if it hadn't, I wasn't about to
spend time arguing with him.  I nodded sharply and we all headed out
the door one step short of a dead run.

<em>The blurb for "One Hot Night" is:</em>
</p>
<p>
"In a society without death, Ingfred is 20 years old and has no
prospects. All the good jobs are filled by undying masters of their
craft, and it's hard to be taken seriously when you are, compared to
everyone around you, an infant.  Fortunately, he has a solution:
undergo an illegal transformation and sell the memory to The
Experiental Herald for a ridiculous sum.
</p>

<p>
There's two problems: how can Ingfred convince a powerful wizard to
risk his mage license and his freedom to help with such a crazy plan?
And, once that's done...how will Ingfred deal with the law?"
</p>
