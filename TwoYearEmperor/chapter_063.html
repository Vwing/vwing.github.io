<p>
The canyon floor was bedlam.  Semi-organized bedlam, but still bedlam.
No longer were people racing out of the various Holes on the south
wall of the canyon, past the altars, and into the corresponding Hole
on the north wall.  Instead, they came out of the various Holes on the
south wall, into the Teleportation Circle that had been set up in
front of it, out the linked Circle on the top of the canyon where all
our industry was set up, through the various POPE engines, made a
quick stop at their assigned FLEA so they could go from being a level
1 commoner to a level 60 multi-caster, then through the appropriate
Teleportation Circle that led back down to their particular altar, and
into the corresponding Hole on the north wall.  Everything was set up
so that they never had to change direction or stop moving...if you
could twist your head around far enough, the whole thing was a
straight line path.  It just happened to be a straight line that had
Euclid spinning in his grave so fast you could have run a steam engine
off of him.
</p>

<p>
As the new POPEs came online, we'd been setting up new FLEAs and new
altars to work with them.  Another (particularly involved) set of
spell engines were creating the Teleportation Circles.  It was a
complex process; two engines fired, using True Creation to create two
spidersilk blankets.  A third fired, casting Teleportation Circle on
one of the blankets, with the other blanket as the emergence point.
Finally, a fourth engine cast Permanency on the Circle, at which point
a railgun of people would snatch up the blankets and move them to
where they were needed.
</p>

<p>
The blankets were, in my opinion, a very cool hack.  The intent of the
spell was clearly to be immobile, but the wording was that it could be
cast on 'the floor or other horizontal surface,' which meant that
blankets were perfectly doable.  I'd been impressed the first time
that Albrecht told me about this, back when we first met.  Actually
seeing them being set up was even more impressive.  The upshot was
that our mobility was increasing by leaps and bounds every round.
</p>

<p>
The flow of people was not as efficient as it could be, however.
There was too much rubbernecking as people paused momentarily to gaze
in awe at the Milky Way-esque spray of glowing haze that had settled
over the altars.  By now we had several dozen altars stretching down
the canyon for a hundred yards; the haze stretched from one end of the
line to the other, overhanging several dozen yards on each end.  It
had no defined shape, ebbing and flowing slowly in something that was
either simple Brownian motion or a fibrillating heartbeat, I wasn't
sure which.
</p>

<p>
The haze was...impressive.  And scary.  And disturbing.  And a lot of
other adjectives that I was a bit too numb to come up with at the
moment.  It was composed of the light emitted by individual star-like
points of light in varying colors&mdash;black and silver and blue and
green and white and gold.  They varied in size; some were smaller than
a grain of sand, one was the size of a cow, and most were about the
size of a marble .  There were a <em>lot</em> more black stars than
all of the other colors together.  Disturbingly many.  And most of
them were above average size.  The implications of all this were
sufficiently obvious, even without the fact that every sacrifice was
now generating a colored star that floated up to join the rest.
</p>

<p>
"Well <em>that's</em> not good," I said with studied calm.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see any more black stars going up," Drifa said in the tone of
someone desperately groping for a silver lining.
</p>

<p>
We all stared at it for a while in silence.
</p>

<p>
After a while, I noticed something odd: the stars at the southernmost
end of the ravine were substantially larger than average, each being
about the size of a plum.  "What's that?" I asked, pointing.
</p>

<p>
"That's an experiment suggested by Archmage Cullen, M'Lord," Suze told
us.  "Everyone who graduates from the FLEA gains a very large number
of skill points.  Some of them are being told to sink all of those
points into highly esoteric Language- and Knowledge Skills like
'clothing fashions in the merchants quarter of Akornhamr between 1000
BA and 1002 BA.'  That gives them a lot of knowledge sufficiently
esoteric that no one else in the world possesses it, which means it's
effectively a secret.  Then they sacrifice all of it."
</p>

<p>
I blinked at that.  "That's...really slick," I said.  "Isn't it not
that big a sacrifice, though?  Sounds like it's most unimportant
trivia."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht shrugged.  "They're basically giving up several hundred skill
points that they could have used for things that actually benefited
them.  Based on the size of the stars we're getting, it seems
efficient.  It's been running since last night and the results seem
positive, so we're going to switch everyone over to doing that.
Probably not <em>all</em> of their skill points, but the majority of
them."  He paused.  "Personally, I'm just glad that it turns out you
can sacrifice broad swaths of knowledge at a time, without needing to
write down each individual item."
</p>

<p>
I nodded in silent agreement, still watching the parade of lights
before me.  After a moment, a thought struck me and I turned to Suze.
"How did you know about that, Suze?"
</p>

<p>
She ducked her head a bit but maintained eye contact.  "I figured it
was my job, Your Majesty, so I went around the city last night to see
who was who and what was going on."
</p>

<p>
My eyebrows went up in pleased surprise.  "Nice going," I told her.  I
was reminded again of what a treasure I had found in my memory maiden.
</p>

<p>
She blushed and smiled, ducking her head a bit more.  "Thank you, Your
Majesty."
</p>

<p>
I gave her a wink and then turned back to the others.  "Ok, things
seem to be coming along here as far as getting it done.  We're two
days in, maybe halfway through the city's population, and the black
secrets still outnumber the rest.  Nothing to do that I can think of
aside from keeping on keeping on.  Drifa, how much time do we have
left?  When is the ritual over?"
</p>

<p>
"When we say it is, Your Majesty," she responded.  "There was a series
of ritual elements that marked the beginning of the ritual, and
there's another series that mark the end.  When we perform those, the
spell completes and the Lady's...form, I guess?...is finalized.  We
can keep going as long as we want, but once we finish it, that's it.
No second chances."
</p>

<p>
Everyone looked thoughtful at that.
</p>

<p>
"How long does it take to do the closing ceremonies?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"A couple of hours," she replied.  "And there can't be any more
sacrifices during that time, or it will destabilize everything."
</p>

<p>
"What signs will we receive that the spell is ready for a successful
completion?"  Isaac asked.
</p>

<p>
Drifa shrugged.  "No idea," she said.  She waved a hand at the haze
above us.  "I wasn't even expecting this.  The whole ritual is spit
and baling wire; nothing like it has been done in recorded history, so
we have no clue what we'll see along the way."
</p>

<p>
"Hmph," Isaac muttered disapprovingly. 
</p>

<p>
"Ok, so, I guess we're back to the 'nothing more to do except keep on
keeping on.'" I said.  "Given that, what's our next course of action?
Anyone?"
</p>

<p>
<em>*My suggestion would be to talk to Icefi about what Afi is up to,
especially this research into Mindscrape,*</em> Albrecht sent to all
of us over our Telepathic Bond.  "We should probably try to brainstorm
up ways of locating the lichs' phylacteries," he said aloud.
</p>

<p>
I blinked at the two-tiered response, and then recognized his thought
process: he was providing plausible intel for any gods who might be
scrying us while we were exposed outside the city, making it seem that
we weren't aware of the possibility of divine scrying.
</p>

<p>
<em>*I'm with you on that.  Hey, Icefi!  What can you tell us about
what Afi's up to? Especially with this Mindscrape research?*</em> I
sent.  "Seems sensible," I said, responding to Albrecht's out-loud
comment.  I was having trouble switching between the two
conversations; I suspect my words came out pretty wooden, but
hopefully it wouldn't be too obvious.  "Before we do that though,
could we take a break?  I don't know about you guys, but I could use
some quiet time to think."  By which I actually meant I didn't want to
have to juggle two conversations at once.
</p>

<p>
<em>*There is a limit to what I can tell you,*</em> Icefi responded mentally.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," Albrecht said, answering my out-loud words.  "Why don't
you head up to the top of the canyon and walk around a bit?  I'm going
to take a look at the production of the new altars, see if there's any
way to streamline that."  Giving a polite nod, he walked off and
through one of the Teleportation Circles that lead up to the canyon
top.
</p>

<p>
<em>*Why so?*</em> I sent over the link in response to Icefi's rather
cagey answer about information sharing.
</p>

<p>
<em>*I may be Chaotic Good now,*</em> the thing responded.  <em>*That
doesn't mean that I can go against my programming.  I still need to do
what I view as in my creator's best interests, it's just that now I
have a different perspective on what those interests are.*</em>
</p>

<p>
I noticed Suze looking worried by that response and forced myself to
keep a blank, thoughtful expression as we walked through the Circle to
the top of the canyon.  Choosing a direction at random, I started
pacing away from the canyon edge, the Landguard spreading out around
me in their standard overlapping circles of protection.  Alpha Squad
and Thomas stayed close in, but another thirty or forty Landguard
formed several outer perimeters.  By now, the various production lines
had spread far enough, and there were enough commoner railguns moving
goods around, that we had to wind around quite a bit to keep to open
ground, and it made it hard for the Landguard to hold relative
position.  Somehow, they managed.
</p>

<p>
<em>~Can't really call these 'commoner' railguns any more,~</em> I
thought to myself.  <em>~These are now some of the most powerful
people in the world, or about to be.~</em> I shook the thought aside
and concentrated on the mental conversation with the mega-lich Ice
Assassin.
</p>

<p>
<em>*Very well,*</em> Albrecht sent.  <em>*What</em> can <em>you tell
us?*</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>*As to the Mindscrape research, that's not the Creator,*</em>
Icefi told us with an edge of amusement.  <em>*That's actually us,
members of the the Free Corps.  We've been masquerading as the Creator
and buying up all those scrolls and spellbooks.*</em>
</p>

<p>
Pretty much everyone in the link sent the equivalent of a mental
'Huh?' at that.
</p>

<p>
<em>*Aren't you worried about the potential consequences?*</em>
Albrecht sent.  <em>*If someone mentions the purchases in the presence
of the real Afi he'll know that he hasn't been doing it, and that he
never told any of his bound Ice Assassins to do it.  If Neklos were
manifesting at that time, it could put Him on the track to being aware
of your 'Free Corps,' as you call it.*</em>
</p>

<p>
A mental snort came over the wire.  <em>*Hardly.  Give us credit,
mortal.  Most of us have only existed for a few years, but we
have</em> millenia <em>of experience to draw upon.  We Mindscraped one
of the Known into thinking that it was his idea, and that he was going
to use it to research a mass version of Mindscrape that could be used
as a battlefield spell.  We purchase the books, copy them, then pass
them on to him.  He thinks that we're just other Known that he's
delegated to.*</em>
</p>

<p>
A mass version of Mindscrape?  Now <em>there</em> was a charming
thought.  It was bad enough that Afi had a few legions of fanatically
devoted clones of himself, all of whom had enough Diplomacy ranks to
function as mind control.  The idea of all of them being able to
instantaneously edit the loyalties and memories of large numbers of
opponents gave me a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach.
</p>

<p>
<em>*I take it that's not what you're actually working on?*</em> Unn
asked.
</p>

<p>
<em>*No.  It would have some utility, of course, but it's not
essential.  No, we're looking for a way to remove the shard from the
Creator.*</em>
</p>

<p>
I stumbled in shock.  <em>*How does Mindscrape do that?  The shard
isn't just a memory, is it?*</em> I demanded.
</p>

<p>
<em>*The shard has both a mental and spiritual component,*</em> Icefi
responded.  <em>*Mindscrape leaves the mind utterly open and
manipulable by the caster.  It also has a limited access to the
spiritual side of the target, which is what's used when you Mindscrape
a target to have another alignment.  We are trying to extend the
spiritual side of it enough that we could edit out the shard.*</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>*Is that</em> possible<em>?*</em> Drifa demanded, somewhere
between awe and horror.
</p>

<p>
The response came tagged with a mental shrug.  <em>*Maybe not.
Certainly we've had no success so far, but it's the only idea we've
come up with for how to get the Creator free.  If he retains the shard
then, sooner or later, Neklos will take him over completely.*</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>*Couldn't happen soon enough for me,*</em> Thomas sent over a
private channel to me.  <em>*Neklos is a micromanager with no patience
and, as far as I can tell, little experience in war.  Afi is a general
and battlemage with thousands of years of experience, strategically
and tactically brilliant, and has a virtual hivemind of duplicates.  I
would much prefer that Neklos were in charge of the opposition.*</em>
</p>

<p>
I nodded abstractedly at that.  <em>*Hey, why did Afi accept the shard
in the first place?*</em> I asked on the public 'frequency.'  <em>*If
he's so smart, why didn't he recognize the danger?*</em>
</p>

<p>
Icefi shrugged mentally.  <em>*I was created before he took the shard
and I wasn't present when it happened, so I don't know the answer for
certain.  Neklos may not have given him a choice.  Or perhaps the
Creator felt he needed the power for something he was currently
facing.  Or perhaps Neklos influenced him...he's not able to simply
force a sentient being to do something, but it does seem that he can
exert subtle influence on the undead.  As I said, I simply don't
know.*</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>*Another question,*</em> Unn put in.  <em>*You keep talking about
how Afi Mindscraped himself, and how you Mindscraped one of the Known.
Undead are immune to mind affecting spells, so how did you do
that?*</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>*Simple,*</em> the thing responded with overtones of
amusement.  <em>*You Polymorph Any Object the target into something
that isn't undead, then use Dispel Magic to put it back into its
original form. As the Dispel goes off, you have a second caster do the
Mindscrape as a readied action.  The Mindscrape leaves the target with
no memory of it being cast, and the two spells happen so close
together that there's no perceptible time in between for the target to
wonder why he's in a different form.*</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>*Clever,*</em> Thomas sent.  <em>*As long as you're being clever,
how did Afi find Magnhild's phylactery?  It would be useful if we
could do the same thing to the other Lich Kings.  Or can't you tell us
because it would threaten your creator?*</em>
</p>

<p>
Mental snickering came over the link.  <em>*No, it's not an issue; you
won't be able to use it.  The Creator assigned a few thousand of us to
each Lich King.  First we made ourselves amulets of Mind Blank so we
couldn't be detected via divinations, then we set up Permanent
Telephatic Bonds connecting each member of the group to each other
member and to the Creator. Finally, we used Polymorph Any Object to
turn ourselves into dust mites&mdash;we cast it twice so that it was
permanent.  One of us would climb into the target's skull and wait
there while the rest scattered around their lair and the surrounding
area.  After that it was just a question of waiting a few decades
until the target went to check on their phylactery, then reporting
back by way of the Telepathic Bond, passing on full details of the
protections and how to bypass them.*</em>
</p>

<p>
Well, that wasn't sobering at all.  And the reason that the thing was
willing to share was pretty obvious: even if we had the necessary
legions of Ice Assassins and the time to wait, Afi probably never
visited his own phylactery.  He didn't need to, since he could just
send a random Ice Assassin to do it, and it wasn't feasible to 'bug'
every single Ice Assassin he had.  Also, it was even more sobering to
hear that there were "thousands" of Ice Assassins&mdash;actually, tens
of thousands, since he'd assigned thousands to each of several dozen
Lich Kings.  And that was probably only part of his force.  I had
known it was foolish, but I had still been holding on to the hope that
maybe the six hundred-ish that we'd killed had been the majority of
his total.
</p>

<p>
We spent a minute or so chewing on all that, but couldn't really see
where to go with it from there.  Since no one had any more questions,
and the conversation seemed more or less over, we all turned our feet
back towards Gr&#491;fhamr.  Meeting up at the entrance, we spent
some not-insignificant time pacing the halls and discussing what to do
next.  It took a while, but eventually we had a consensus.
</p>

<p>
"Loki, Loki, Loki," I recited, feeling sufficiently afraid of what I
was about to get into that a Lovecraft reference seemed appropriate.
</p>

<p>
"You don't have to shout, you know," the Harlequin-painted Trickster
said from his position floating face-down above us in the corridor
where there was totally not enough room for him.  "What's goin' on,
kid?  Kudos on the magic stuff, by the way.  The production lines are
slick."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," I told him diffidently.  I was seriously worried about how
he was going to react to my next question&mdash;worried enough that I
was having trouble talking around the lump in my throat.
</p>

<p>
"So, what's on your brain?" he asked, floating down to the floor with
a pike and a half-twist.  He proceeded to pace us down the corridor,
walking on his hands.
</p>

<p>
"We're private, right?" I asked, still stalling.
</p>

<p>
"As a new Army recruit," he told me.  He frowned, then flipped himself
upright.  "Hm.  Maybe not the best analogy.  Privates don't actually
have any privacy...although their privates are supposed to, but that's
a fairly private subject, even though a lot of privates seem to enjoy
talking about their privates."
</p>

<p>
I let that one go right on by; it wasn't anything I wanted to get
into.
</p>

<p>
"So, there's something I wanted to ask you.  This isn't one of my
questions, I just wanted to get your reaction," I told him.
</p>

<p>
One red-and-black-diamond-spangled eyebrow went up.  "Fascinating," he
said in a completely calm monotone.  "Shoot." 
</p>

<p>
I licked my lips nervously and took the plunge.  "Suppose that
Deathboy...weren't...um.. here, any more.  What do you think would
happen?"
</p>

<p>
A wide grin split the clown face; he flickered and suddenly there was
a Stetson-wearing, leather-chaps-clad cowboy rolling along beside me
with a bowlegged gait, spurs jingling with every step.  "Wal now,
pahdna, y'all shur ain't thinkin' small, now is ya?"  There was
another flicker and he was in a tracksuit and running shoes.
</p>

<p>
"We should probably pick it up a bit.  We're going to want to be
transitioning quickly," he informed me, breaking into a high-paced
lope.  I sped up to match him, but it was a pretty darn fast jog and
he didn't talk for a while. I was winded within a minute, but forced
myself to struggle on.
</p>

<p>
"Death is one of the major portfolios," Loki murmured, his mouth
covered by a pixelated blur as he took care to spread the words across
half a dozen corridor segments.  "If the Death god were to disappear,
there'd be a major power struggle as everyone rearranged.  It would be
mostly political though, meaning that it would be happening in the
Meeting Hall over in Sigil"&mdash;he glanced at me and saw my lack of
comprehension.  "Sigil, the city at the center of the multiverse.
There's a Meeting Hall there that the gods use when we all need to
gather.  Last time we were there was when we created Shailos's Edict.
Anyway, we'd all gather there to sort things out.  We'd leave our
seconds&mdash;angels, whatever&mdash;to deal with answering prayers
and granting spells while we were there, so there wouldn't be as much
pressure being placed here on the Prime Material.  It wouldn't make
the wars just <em>stop</em>, but it would prevent them from ramping up
any further, and the local reps might take some time to regroup
instead of pushing forward.  So, yeah, it would probably take some of
the pressure off of you.  Why?"
</p>

<p>
Now we got to the real sticking point.  "Suppose that we were,
um...maybe...possibly somehow tangentially involved in the Death God
not being around anymore.  What would happen to us?"
</p>

<p>
He snickered.  "Well now, that <em>is</em> an impressive number of
weasel words, isn't it?  I think it would very much depend on how the
new power structure shook out.  If, after the shakeup, the majority of
the top gods liked you, then you'd be fine.  If not...well...squish."
</p>

<p>
"Ah," I said faintly, panting a bit and favoring the stitch in my
side.  "So...is there any...chance that you could...get us an audience
with the Death God...do you think?"  I leaned on my knees to catch my
breath.
