<hr />

<p>
"Jake, what is it?  What's wrong?"  A normal person would have been
panicked; Thomas just needed targetting data.  
</p>

<p>
I couldn't talk through the sobs, I could only shake my head and try
to suck in air between tear-choked whimpers.
</p>

<p>
Thomas cursed and lay me down so he could turn to the other two
Landguard.  "Do either of you have it?" he demanded.  Duncan and
Robert both shook their heads without turning around.  "I think Bob
does," Duncan ground out.  Even though they had to know by now that
there was no material threat, they remained on guard because it was
all they could do to control the situation.  Thomas was doing what
could be done for me; all they could manage was to ensure that no new
complications came up.  Ideally, by stabbing said complications in the
face.  Repeatedly.
</p>

<p>
"Sending to Bob Guardson: Foxglove in emotional breakdown, need
assistance stat."  I could hardly see through the kaleidoscope of my
tears, but I made out movement as the smoke sparrow winged away.  It
barely impinged on my conscious mind; I was far too busy drowning in
regret, shame, and horror at my own failures, at the
horrible <em>premeditated</em> evil that I had committed...not once,
not twice, but over and over.
</p>

<p>
When Thomas released me to turn to the others, I had curled into the
tiniest ball I could and rolled to the side, facing away from all of
them in shame.  The sobs ripped through me, shaking me like a rag
doll.  Thomas knelt beside me and scooped me back into his arms,
rubbing my back and murmuring quiet comforting noises, the way you
would soothe a crying infant. I was only vaguely aware of his efforts,
and couldn't focus on them enough for them to have any real impact.
</p>

<p>
I have no idea how long it was before booted feet came tearing into
the room so fast there should have been Doppler shift.  Bob slid the
last few feet on his knees, slapped a hand on my shoulder and cried
"Calm Emotions" in a voice infused with power.
</p>

<p>
A wall of glass dropped between me and the pain.  Instantly, I was as
calm and centered as a Zen master during meditation.  I sat up,
blinking and wiping the tears from my eyes and the snot from my nose
and mouth.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing?" I asked in muted curiosity.
</p>

<p>
Bob's eyes were closed as he answered, a frown of concentration on his
face.  "It's a spell to provide centering.  It removes pain, joy,
fear...like the name says, it leaves you calm.  We usually use it to
protect against magical attacks, but it works for normal emotions
too."
</p>

<p>
I wasn't actually bothered by this&mdash;I doubt I could be bothered
by anything at the moment&mdash;but I was pretty sure that I should
be.  "You're messing with my mind <em>again</em>?  Is that your answer
to everything?"
</p>

<p>
"No, M'Lo&mdash;er, no Your Imperial Majesty," Thomas said cautiously.
"We need to know what the problem is, that's&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, <em>'again'</em>?" Duncan growled, sheathing his
blades and turning to face me now that the room and the corridor beyond
were a living wall of Landguard.
</p>

<p>
Oops.  Telling them the whole story was probably contraindicated, so
far as my survival chances went.  The Calm Emotions spell was clearly
area effect, as everyone around me looked merely curious instead of
worried.  Despite that, I was reasonably certain that when the effect
wore off they would be...displeased, were I to admit that I had
betrayed them to their enemies, arranged the deaths of two of the
original three Archmagi, killed six hundred Landguard (along with a
dozen Special Squads and several dozen sages) and reveled in the
horrific death toll they had paid fighting through an ocean of undead.
Oh and, lest we forget, I had also literally blown a small Flobovian
village off the map.
</p>

<p>
"I meant...."  Quickly, I groped for a lie.  "Well, when I came here,
you downloaded all this information into my brain.  And now here you
are, manipulating my mind again."
</p>

<p>
Duncan studied me through slitted eyes.  "No," he said slowly.
"That's not what you meant.  What <em>did</em> you mean, and why do
you need to lie about it?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas stared at me; with the calming spell in effect he couldn't
literally have his hackles up but he might as well have.  "Answer the
question," he demanded.  His tone brooked no refusal.
</p>

<p>
My mouth worked for a minute, but I had nothing.  I decided maybe a
partial truth would do.  "I figured out that the Archmagi messed with
my memories my second night here, and you had to have allowed it.
What were you thinking?!"  I tried to inject righteous indignation
into my tone to help shift the focus from my errors to theirs.
Instantly, I realized that was a mistake; I couldn't actually
be <em>feeling</em> righteous indignation at the moment, so if I
sounded like I was then I was, by definition, lying.
</p>

<p>
Thomas narrowed his eyes.  "You're lying. Whatever you're worried
about, does it relate to your breakdown?"
</p>

<p>
The calm that was being forced on me kept any trace of guilt from my
voice.  "No.  I was pissed when I figured out that they blocked off
some of my memories, but I assume it was so that I wouldn't be
distracted from the war effort by homesickness.  Good cause or not,
they still should have asked first."
</p>

<p>
Thomas stared at me, not quite sure if he believed me.  "Then what
caused the breakdown?"
</p>

<p>
"Uh&mdash;" my brain froze.  I had absolutely no idea what to say.
Knowing I had to say <em>something</em>, I opened my mouth; amazingly,
words came out.  "Claustrophobia.  It's too tight in here, too many
people."  The instant I said it, I knew it was the wrong thing to say.
If Thomas knew that the Archmagi had removed my capacity for fear,
then he would instantly know that this was another lie.
</p>

<p>
His lips firmed and my heart sank; yep, he knew.
</p>

<p>
"It is our duty to protect the Land, and to protect you, no matter
what it takes." The words were calm, and freighted with implacable
intent.  "Albrecht needs you for tactics in order to protect the Land.
If you're having a breakdown you can't supply those tactics and the
Land will be at greater risk.  Also, we can't protect you if we don't
know what the threat is.  Try again, and tell us the truth this time
or I will dig it out for myself."
</p>

<p>
I really wanted to be angry; it would have been a great way to deflect
this and change topics.  Unfortunately, the Calm Emotions spell had
locked my anger away in the same cell that was currently housing my
debilitating misery.  "It's nothing, Thomas.  Let it go&mdash;that's
an order.  We need to go find Albrecht so that we can start planning
our next move.  Come on&mdash;" I started to push myself to my feet,
only to run into a hand that felt more like an iron bar.  Without
seeming to exert any effort, Thomas pressed me back to the floor.
</p>

<p>
"Detect Thoughts," he announced, staring intently at me.
</p>

<p>
My brain tried to panic and couldn't.  Instead, I used my magic-given
perfect recall to pull up the memory of the brick wall next to my
apartment back in the real world.  I sank myself in its faded red, the
many bumps and extrusions where warped and broken bricks had been
reused to give it a texture like a climbing wall, the very faint smell
of hot earth and dryness that it exuded.  I built that wall in front
of my mind and held it there, filling my thoughts with nothing but
that.
</p>

<p>
"What is it you don't want us to know?"  Thomas demanded; my wall
shivered for a moment, flashes of other memories leaking through.  I
clamped down before any of them could come into focus.
</p>

<p>
Thomas frowned.  "He's thinking of a brick wall," he said to the other
Landguard.  Turning back to me, he probed further. "Why were you angry
about the Archmagi's spell?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas's little brain-reading spell had to run out eventually, and
they couldn't have an unlimited number of them.  I soaked in the zen
calm their magic had given me, thinking about my wall, enjoying the
magic that was holding at bay all the horror of my prior
actions...crap, I shouldn't have thought that.  I focused on the wall
again.
</p>

<p>
Thomas's frown got deeper.  "It's about something he's done; whatever
it is, it horrifies him," he said over his shoulder to the other
Landguard.  "Does it relate to the secret mission that you sent
Archmagi Isaac and Reynard on?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
The wall shivered as their names brought Isaac and Reynard's faces to
mind, and my imagined picture of what they looked like at the moment
of detonati&mdash;no.  I focused on the wall.
</p>

<p>
"Something about Isaac and Reynard.  He had them cast a spell, and
then there was a giant noise and a flash of light&mdash;almost like an
Explosive Runes blast but...different somehow.  He's holding the wall
too tight, I can't see the details."
</p>

<p>
Duncan humphed thoughtfully.  "Could it be a legitimate strategic
ruse?  Compartmentalizing secret data, even from trustworthy people?"
</p>

<p>
A faint surge of hope flickered through me; would Thomas buy that and
break off the questioning?...crap, he must have seen me thinking
that. I set the memory of my hands on the memory of the wall and
looked for the exact position of the brick extrusion that looked like
it should make a decent foothold but really didn't.  On top of that
image I layered the sound of every obnoxious, stick-in-your-mind
commercial I had ever heard, starting with <em>Double good, double
good...Doublemint gum!</em>
</p>

<p>
Thomas shook his head.  "No.  He was hoping that would be enough to
make me let it go.  I think it might be Case Black."  The other
Landguard shifted, looking concerned even through the Calm Emotions
spell.
</p>

<p>
Thomas turned back to me, a determined look on his face.  "Since
coming to Flobovia have you taken any actions harmful to the nation or
her people?"
</p>

<p>
A flash of the crater where Yellow Pines had been passed before my
eyes; I immediately replaced it with the image of Duke Frederick's
hand being crushed at my orders.  "Well, I had Duncan hurt Duke
Fre&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Thomas spoke right over me, keeping his eyes fastened on me even as he
passed the information over his shoulder to the other Landguard.
"Something about Yellow Pines.  I think he might have had something to
do with its destruction, but he's holding on tight to that wall."
</p>

<p>
"Should I drop the Calm Emotions, Commander?" Bob offered.  "He won't
be able to hold the wall, but it'll scramble him up pretty bad, might
be hard to read through."
</p>

<p>
Thomas studied me for another moment, then nodded firmly.  "Do it.
It'll run out pretty soon anyway, we might as well make it useful."
</p>

<p>
"Dismiss Calm Emotions," Bob said firmly, his voice echoing with
power.
</p>

<p>
The spell had not removed my misery, my horror at my own
depravity&mdash;it had only set a wall between me and those emotions,
holding them at bay for a time.  The instant that Bob released that
wall the emotions smashed back into me, far harder than even a
Landguard could punch.  Instantly, I was curled up in a ball again,
sobbing.
</p>

<p>
Rough hands rolled me over onto my back so my face was visible.
Distantly, I heard Thomas speaking, his voice insistent. "What is
causing this breakdown?  What happened to Isaac, Reynard, and Yellow
Pines?"
</p>

<p>
My head was far too jumbled and chaotic to put up any sort of defense,
and this was exactly what was causing the chaos, so the images were at
the surface anyway.  They flashed back, like a highlights reel of my
worst evils.
</p>

<p>
  <center><em><strong>~= seven days before today =~</strong></em></center>
</p>

<p>
<em>
Archmage Isaac Davidson's thoughts were
interrupted&mdash;finally!&mdash;by the arrival of a tiny, ghostly
bird.  It flew up, hovered in front of him and spoke in Thomas's
voice.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>"Now." </em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Isaac leapt to his feet in triumph and cried out "Polymorph Any
Object: rock to six grams of antimatter osmium!"</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>
Fifty miles away, Albrecht and I watched the mushroom cloud climb
slowly into the sky, revealing the big empty hole where the top of
Mount Herabu&mdash;and, although we couldn't see it, former Archmage
Isaac Davidson&mdash;completely ceased to be.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>
"And lo, I am become Death, Destroyer of Worlds," I whispered softly,
and smiled as I marked off the first item on my todo list.
</em>
</p>

<p>
  <center><em><strong>~= four days before today =~</strong></em></center>
</p>

<p>
<em>"You found it?!" Had Albrecht been any more astonished I think his
jaw would have actually bounced off the ground.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>"Yep," I responded smugly, hooking my thumbs in the edges of my
trenchcoat and rocking on my heels a bit.  "Surely did.  And I have a
mage right outside ready to bring us there, if you'd care to
come."</em>
</p>

<p>
  <center><em>o-o-o-o</em></center>
</p>

<p>
<em>We paced slowly through the stone corridors of the temple,
studying the carvings and reliefs on the walls.  Although elegantly
carved and beautiful in their own right, they were not just for
decoration.  Those "decorations" held secrets: history, biographies,
descriptions of gods and monsters, magical theory&mdash;the list went
on and on.  They were clearly just as new to Albrecht as they were to
me...and to every other mage, sage, and historian who had come in here
to study them in the last twenty four hours.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>"How did you find this place?" Albrecht asked in a reverent
whisper, his eyes still on the walls.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>I shrugged.  "Loki owed me twenty questions; I burned a bunch of
them to binary search the country until I had this place narrowed down
to about twenty square miles.  Then I shipped in six hundred Landguard
and they did a brute force search from there."</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>He snapped out of his distraction and turned to face me, a frown
creasing his face.  "How did you 'ship in' six hundred Landguard?  You
don't have Teleportation Circles or enough mages to move large numbers
of people around, and as of yesterday ago there weren't more than fifty
Landguard within a hundred miles of this place."</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>I smiled secretively.  "Are you sure we don't have Teleportation
Circle?  Just because we don't use it regularly doesn't mean we
can't."  I turned and paced up the corridor, leaving him to wonder.
The truth, of course, was far more prosaic: I had stuffed all
thirty-one of our Portable Holes full of Landguard and then had a mage
teleport the whole mess to the area.  It had been risky; jamming
twenty people into a pit ten feet deep and only six across had meant
that they were literally sitting on each other's shoulders and packed
together so tightly they had to take turns breathing.  There were only
ten person-minutes of air in a Portable Hole, so they would all have
suffocated in a few minutes once the Holes were closed.  Fortunately,
it only took a few seconds to pick up the Holes, teleport, and set
them down again.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Albrecht stared at my retreating back for a moment with narrowed
eyes, then hurried to catch up.  "What do you mean 'brute force
searched'?"  he demanded.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>I shrugged and turned to inspect a carving that showed a battle
between a woman with a trident and something with far too many
tentacles.  "I mean they formed a line five miles wide, ran north four
miles, turned around, stepped five feet west, then ran back.  I don't
know how many passes they had to do, but eventually one of them saw
through the illusion that was masking this place&mdash;mostly because
he bumped into the door.  The Landguard can run four miles in a few
minutes, so the search only took a few hours."</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Albrecht looked flabbergasted for a moment, then started grumbling
under his breath.  Personally, I think he was just jealous that he
hadn't thought of it first.</em>
</p>

<p>
  <center><em>o-o-o-o</em></center>
</p>


<p>
<em>The temple itself was small&mdash;at least, the part of it that
showed aboveground was. Below ground, layer after layer of rooms
sprawled out in all directions.  Each level was accessed through a
carefully hidden secret door; the entrances were cleverly masked both
physically and magically.  Level three was reached by swinging the
kitchen stove back from the wall and going down the steps thus
revealed.  Level eight was accessed by climbing <strong>up</strong> a
ladder in the ceiling of level seven, but only if you skipped every
third rung. To reach level fourteen you needed to walk down a
particular hallway backwards, hooding and unhooding a specific
sequence of wall sconces as you went.  Level twenty three...well,
suffice it to say that it got harder as you went down.  I had a dozen
rogue-heavy Special Squads tearing the place apart looking for the
accessways.  Dozens of sages followed along behind, trying to learn
all they could about what we were seeing.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Level forty seven was the lowest we had so far located.  Unlike
the rest, it was a stretch of vast caverns, connected by short and
often windy passages.  The caverns were filled, top to bottom, with
books.  Shelf after shelf after shelf, most of them fifty or sixty
feet high, with rolling ladders to make reaching the upper shelves
feasible.  The magi were literally drooling as they stared in wonder
at the largest library anyone had ever heard of, much less seen.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>"So, care to tell me about this place?" I asked casually as we
stared out at all the books.  "Why were you looking for it?"</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Albrecht glanced at me for an instant, then went back to swiveling
his head around like a tourist in Times Square.  "This is the temple
of Herr&uacute;n, the forgotten goddess of secrets.  It cannot be
scried on, located by magic, teleported into...it is undetectable
unless you literally walk into it.  Even if you know where it is, the
door is the only entrance; you cannot dig in, phase in, or enter in
any way except through the door. It would make an ideal base of
operations for strikes against the drauga."</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>I raised an eyebrow.  "You had to come to another continent to
find this place?  She didn't have any temples in your zip code?"</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Albrecht shrugged.  "Like I said, <strong>forgotten</strong>
goddess.  She hasn't been worshipped in at least nine thousand years,
as far as we can tell. In fact, no one had even heard of her until a
few months ago when one of our sages dug up a passing reference in the
archives.  We figured that, if we could find this place and find the
appropriate rituals, we could have a few million people start
worshipping her in order to give her the strength to come back and
help us.  Having the goddess of secrets on our side would be an
unstoppable intelligence advantage, and if we were her only
worshippers she'd be strongly motivated to help, if only to maintain
her own power."</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>I nodded attentively and went back to considering how best to
address my oath to Loki.</em>
</p>

<p>
  <center><em><strong>~= three days before today =~</strong></em></center>
</p>

<p>
<em>"Reynard, I know you've been wondering where I sent Isaac off to.
Simply put, I sent him on a secret mission to get us a game changer,
just in case we end up having to fight the Deorsi after all.  I want
you to join him, but remember: total communication silence.  No
messages in or out until the mission is completed.  We can't risk the
Deorsi finding out what we're doing.  Got it?  Good.  Now, as the
first step in this mission, I need you to go into the temple and do
something for me.  I've written the details on this paper; just use
Polymorph Any Object to create what it says and note the results.
Remember, this is really important, and you can't tell anyone."</em>
</p>

<p>
  <center><em>o-o-o-o</em></center>
</p>

<p>
<em>The explosion destroyed every trace of Herr&uacute;n's temple,
leaving a crater three miles wide, destroying everything within five
miles of the rim&mdash;the size and sprawling nature of the caverns
meant that I wasn't sure how far "the temple" actually extended, so I
figured there was no kill like overkill.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>The village of Yellow Pines was only three miles away from ground
zero.  A flyspeck of a town, Yellow Pines was the home of a thousand
men, women, and children, most of whom made their living either
logging or working in the sawmills.  When I had seen it on the map and
noticed it was inside the blast radius, the thought that came to mind
was "I hope they stocked up on SPF2000 sunblock."</em>
</p>

<p>
  <center><em><strong>~= earlier today =~</strong></em></center>
</p>

<p>
<em>The Landguard carved their way through the undead, paying a
horrific cost as they went.  If I hadn't been so busy clinging to
Robert I would have clapped my hands in glee.  This wasn't the way I'd
planned to do it, but they were dropping like flies!</em>
</p>

<p>
  <center><em><strong>~= now =~</strong></em></center>
</p>

<p>
When I eventually broke free of the memories, I forced myself to choke
down the sobs, wipe my eyes, and sit up.  I looked over at Thomas to
gauge his reaction; I didn't like what I saw.  His eyes were slitted,
all the blood had drained from his face, and his whole body was
shaking in rage. I had never seen him so furious, even when he
attacked Albrecht after we fought our way in here.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Commander?  What did you see?" asked Duncan in a gravelly
voice that said he knew he wasn't going to like the answer.
</p>

<p>
For a full minute, Thomas said nothing.  Another minute passed, and
still he was silent.  The tension in the room was almost physical; I
sat perfectly still, a mouse hoping that the cat wouldn't notice it.
When Thomas finally spoke, his words were low and harsh and he never
took his eyes off of me.
</p>

<p>
"Get. Out.  All of you."
</p>

<p>
The other Landguard looked at each other and then, reluctantly, left
the room.  The door closed with a quiet 'click'.
</p>

<p>
Thomas pressed one hand over my mouth to keep me quiet.  The other
hand wrapped around my elbow and ground it to paste with a casual
squeeze.
