<em><strong>Author's Note</strong>:  Still don't own D&D.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em><strong>Author's Note #2:</strong> Until September 21, 2014 I am
on the opposite side of the International Date Line from normal.  As
such, you are probably seeing this update on a different day than
expected.  Updates still happen on Saturday, but that's Saturday of
whatever time zone I'm in at the time.</em>
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Thomas took my hand and helped me to my feet with a casual ease that
reminded me of how inhumanly strong he was.  And, incidentally, just
how much of a double-edged sword that had been in the time I'd known
him.  I winced as phantom pain shot through my elbow.
</p>

<p>
"What was <em>that</em>?" Drifa demanded, sounding rattled.  "Even Loki's
sacrifice wasn't that big.  What in the name of all the Holy Ones did
you sacrifice?"
</p>

<p>
I shrugged helplessly.  "No idea," I told her honestly.  The fact that
she asked showed just how flabbergasted she was; she knew perfectly
well that I wouldn't be able to answer, but the question had clearly
been jolted out of her involuntarily.
</p>

<p>
Truth to tell, I wasn't thinking about it very much.  My "that's weird
and nervous-making" sense was tingling frantically, and I was trying
to figure out why.
</p>

<p>
This wasn't an unusual experience for me; like most people, my
hindbrain was really good at pattern matching, and often noticed
things that my rational forebrain didn't.  Unfortunately, it wasn't
really good at verbalizing what it noticed, so instead it gave me this
annoyingly non-specific sense of worry until I managed to fix whatever
was bothering it.  In pure self defense, I had evolved a system for
'talking' to it so that I could figure out what was worrying me: ask
questions internally and watch for what made the worry worse.
</p>

<p>
<em>~Is it about people?~</em> I asked myself, monitoring my internal
experience closely.  Nothing changed, so I abandoned that line of
inquiry.
</p>

<p>
<em>~Is it about Afi?~</em> I asked myself.  A flash of fear rolled
through me at the thought of the incredibly dangerous lich; the way he
turned all my companions against me with a few words&mdash;words that
weren't even magical!&mdash;left me sweating.  And thinking about the
lich reminded me of his undead followers that we had had to cut our
way through to get to Gr&#491;fhamr in the first place.  <em>Landguard
head bouncing off my back / leg torn off by zombie wolves / Olivia's
life being torn out by wraiths as she becomes one....</em>
</p>

<p>
"Calm Emotions," Bob said.  I blinked, surprised to find myself on my
knees, arms wrapped around me.  Shrugging, I stood up and brushed the
dust off.  Everyone&mdash;and I mean <em>everyone</em>, including the
several dozen random Gr&#491;fhamrites who were passing by to make
their sacrifices&mdash;was staring at me.
</p>

<p>
The joyful thing about being under a Calm Emotions, however, is that
you can't feel embarrassed.  I <em>so</em> needed to find a way to
make this permanent.
</p>

<p>
"Are you all right, Your Majesty?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
I gave him an arch look, expressing something along the lines
of <em>Obviously not before and obviously now.</em>  He probably would
have blushed, if he weren't included in his own spell.
</p>

<p>
"I think we should return to the war room," Drifa remarked.  "I'm not
sure about the rest of you, but I need a drink."
</p>

<p>
The interruption made me lose the train of thought that I'd been
groping to reclaim, but it sounded like a generally good idea.  I
turned for the entrance to Gr&#491;fhamr (well, the part of
Gr&#491;fhamr that we had emerged from) and followed the others.
</p>

<p>
Once we were all seated around the table and sipping contemplatively
on half-million-dollars-per-bottle Cire Perdue Scotch, I threw the
issue out to the crowd.
</p>

<p>
"Something's bugging me; I think it's about the ritual, but I can't
figure out what it is," I told them.  "Any thoughts?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas interrupted before anyone could respond.  "More immediately,
that last flare must have been seen from miles away.  Gr&#491;fhamr's
position is thoroughly blown; we need to move as soon as possible."
</p>

<p>
Drifa nodded her agreement.  "No argument, but we can't move until the
ritual is over; any interruption will ruin it."
</p>

<p>
"Is there any reason we couldn't stop now?" Thomas demands.
</p>

<p>
Drifa hesitates.  "I can't say for certain; no one in recorded history
has done a ritual like this.  Einarr and I cobbled the details for it
together from theory and speculation, with the outlines of major
sacrificial rituals from a dozen cultures as the foundation.
</p>

<p>
"What I <em>do</em> know," she told us firmly.  "Is that we only get
one chance.  We need the maximum amount of...'pull' behind it, in
order to gather all the fragments of the Lady back together and
properly reify her."  She paused, clearly wondering if she should go
on.  After a moment, she made her choice.
</p>

<p>
"I suspect that as the ritual progresses we will start to see visible
signs," she told us, giving an apologetic shrug at the imprecision.
"I can't say for sure what kind, or even if it will happen, but I
would expect that something will show us that it's succeeding.  In any
case, we don't dare stop now.  We've run less than a hundred thousand
people through; there's almost no chance that that would be enough.
Even if it was, She would be terribly weak, and probably
somewhat...limited, or confused...in her mental faculties."  She
snorted.  "After all, it's not every day that you come back from
having your spiritual essence torn into rags and scattered across
every plane of the multiverse."
</p>

<p>
Something about that resonated with the niggling worry at the back of
my head.
</p>

<p>
"What will she be like?" I asked, trying to find the connection.
"When she comes back, I mean.  What kind of personality should we
expect, what kind of attitude will she have to us?"
</p>

<p>
She shrugged.  "You should really ask Einarr about that; he's the
theorist, he'd have a better idea.  Based on what Loki said, though,
it sounds like she'll be something of an amalgam of all the people who
sacrificed to her&mdash;or, at least, she'll be focused on those
people, and probably some of her agenda will be based around what they
want.  That's just a guess, though.  I could have completely
misunderstood."
</p>

<p>
I startled, remembering something important that had utterly slipped
my mind.  "Right.  Loki.  I made a deal with him to give us&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You <em>what?!</em>" Thomas barked.  "Are you cr&mdash;" he cut
himself off midword, and resumed in a more normal tone of voice.  "Are
you sure that was a good idea, Your Majesty?"  The passive-aggressive
formality while here in private showed just how annoyed he was.
</p>

<p>
I think it was the passive aggressiveness that finally pushed me over
the edge.  Thomas had been a bulwark of strength for me ever since I
got here.  He had also tortured me so, yeah.  That.  For him to now be
all snippy about how I had obtained a major intelligence advantage was
just the last straw.
</p>

<p>
"<em>Yes</em>, I'm sure, Commander!" I snapped at him.  "<em>Yes,</em>
I made a deal with Loki.  I sacrificed...something, I don't know
what...that he wanted kept private, and in return we get eight
questions.  Eight questions where he promised to be <em>honest,
complete, and not deceptive.</em>  I don't see you getting us any
advantage like that, so shut your goddamn mouth!"
</p>

<p>
Everyone was a little taken aback by that; in the moment of silence
that followed, I took a breath and forced myself to calm down.
Getting into a sniping match with Thomas was not just immature, it was
a waste of time that we didn't have.  I took a pull on my Scotch, took
another couple of breaths, and forced myself to continue in a more
reasonable tone.
</p>

<p>
"Look," I said, more calmly.  I spread my arms in a calming gesture,
forcing my face into a pleasant smile.  "What's done is done.  Our
biggest disadvantage in this war is a lack of information&mdash;well,
and the fact that we're facing a nigh-infinite horde of evil monsters
from beyond the grave."  That last bit started off as a joke but the
images it brought to mind drained the blood right out of my face and
left me shaking, bathed in fear-sweat and hyperventilating.  I focused
on my breathing, teetering on the edge of an all-up panic attack.  A
tiny whimper pushed its way out of my throat.
</p>

<p>
"Calm Emotions," Bob said.  Instantly, the fear was trapped behind
that lovely wall of glass.
</p>

<p>
"Ahhh," I sighed, taking as much pleasure in the absence of terror as
I could while the spell was muting my capacity for pleasure.  "Thanks,
Bob, that's much better."
</p>

<p>
I nodded gratefully and took a sip on my mug to help reorganize my
thinking.  Where was I...?
</p>

<p>
"Right, yes.  So, as I was saying," I began, thinking out loud as I
went.  "Our big problem is lack of intelligence about the enemy.  We
need to know what weaknesses they have&mdash;in particular, where
their phylacteries are.  So, what questions do we ask?"
</p>

<p>
Everyone was staring at me in consternation.
</p>

<p>
"We really need to do something about these 'panic attacks' of yours,
Your Majesty," Drifa told me, in an annoyingly caring voice.  "Not
only is it a weakness that we can't afford, but no one should have to
live with such a thing.  I don't have Break Curse prepared today, but
I can get one of my junior clerics in&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I waved her off.  "Won't work," I told her.  "It's not a curse, it's a
psychological condition.  Nothing magic can do about it.  Well," I
hastened to add.  "Except Calm Emotions, of course.  That's just a
stopgap though."  I twisted around so I could see Bob.  "How many
times can you do that, anyway?"
</p>

<p>
He shrugged.  "Quite a few.  I've started devoting most of my spell
slots to it.  The others can pick up the slack on defense and offense;
we decided it was more important for me to help with this."
</p>

<p>
I nodded acknowledgement and turned back to the table, where Unn was
clearly gearing up for a quiet little rant.
</p>

<p>
Unn raised an eyebrow at that.  "Really?" she responded in a dry,
sarcastic tone.  "Magic can't do anything about it?  I have yet to
find a problem that can't be solved through appropriate use of magic,
young man."
</p>

<p>
I suspect I would have found that tone annoying if it weren't for the
lovely glass partition that was currently sectioning off all strong
emotions.  Instead, I just shrugged.  "It's not caused by magic.
Break Curse, Break Enchantment, Dispel Magic...none of it will have an
impact."
</p>

<p>
Unn snorted.  "If it's merely a state of mind, have you tried simply
not having panic attacks?  It seems simpler."
</p>

<p>
The Calm Emotions had expired.  I could tell, because suddenly I was
both angry and exasperated. "You can't...it doesn't...that's
not...argh!" I yelled, clutching my head.
</p>

<p>
Three deep breaths; I set my hands on the table, pressing them flat
and spreading the fingers to help me focus.  "Thank you for the
suggestion, Master High Mage," I told her, forcibly shoving calm into
my voice.  "Unfortunately, that's not how it works.  Whatever works
for you Stupidworlders"&mdash;I used the term deliberately, needing to
hit back for her insensitive comment&mdash;"people from my world can't
just edit out pieces of our brains.  There are ways to get rid of
PTSD, but they involve serious drugs and lots and lots of therapy,
none of which are available here.  We'll just have to keep people on
hand with the Calm Emotions spell; it seems to solve the problem well
enough."
</p>

<p>
Unn wasn't prepared to let it go.  "Well, we could just remove the
fear.  A quick Programmed Amnesia and we could&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I cut her off instantly.  "<em>Hell</em> no!  No one is mucking around
in my head again!"
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;" she started.
</p>

<p>
"No!  I order you to drop it," I told her firmly.  "Moreover, I order
all of you to never use mental magic on me again without my express
permission...or allow anyone else to do it."  I swung to face Thomas
and, behind him, Robert and Aerith.  "And don't get any cute ideas
about mucking with me being a service to the Land and therefore higher
priority than my orders.  If I even suspect that you have done that, I
will order every single Landguard to go get themselves killed fighting
undead.  And if you disobey <em>that</em> order, then we are at direct
war and I will do everything in my power to prosecute that war, even
if it means exposing myself and Gr&#491;fhamr and anyone else to
greater risk.  Seriously, do <em>not</em> mess with me on this."  I
finished up with my best threatening glare, trying to stare them down.
</p>

<p>
Thomas wasn't affected; he returned my glare with a considering look,
then shrugged.  "Fair enough," he responded.  "Now, back to the matter
at hand.  What about these questions?""
</p>

<p>
I watched him for a moment, then let it go.  I closed my eyes and took
a heavy pull on my Scotch to beat the anger away.  I focused on my
breathing for twenty or thirty seconds until I was able to continue
the conversation.
</p>

<p>
"Right.  Anyway, as I was saying," I began.  "We have eight questions
where Loki isn't allowed to deceive us or leave anything out.  We
also have seven questions left over from my previous deal with him.
He's required to be truthful with those, but he's already shown that
he's slippery as hell and can easily be deceptive and truthful at the
same time.  On the other hand, there's no 'I don't have to answer
that' clause on those seven questions.  So, whatever we ask, we need
to be careful to specify which set of questions we're using."
</p>

<p>
Unn nodded.  "We actually have classes on this at the Academy.  When
bargaining with extraplanar creatures or allowing them to grant
Wishes, it's very important to be careful with the wording.  My
suggestion would be...."
</p>

<p>
Things rapidly devolved into an esoteric discussion of syntax,
grammar, rules of logic, and tips for failure-mode analysis.  (Not
that they called it that, of course.)
</p>

<p>
After fifteen or twenty minutes, Loki sighed.  "Bored now," he
informed us, lounging back in the chair that absolutely had not been
there two seconds earlier and for which there was no space at the
table yet it totally fit.
</p>

<p>
I really hate gods.  Trickster gods most of all.
</p>

<p>
"Hi Loki, great to see you," I told him with a big smile.  "We were
just talking about you."
</p>

<p>
He waved indolently in my general direction while sipping on his
pi&ntilde;a colada.  "Yeah, I know; I've been watching you for the
last twenty minutes.  So was Afi, for that matter.  You guys are
idiots, you know that?"
</p>

<p>
There was a lot of concern flying around the table all of a sudden.
"What do you mean Afi was watching us?" Albrecht demanded.
</p>

<p>
Loki rolled his eyes.  "Scry Location lets you see across planes,
which means you can use it to see into a Portable Hole. And, of
course, Gr&#491;fhamr is <em>made</em> of Portable Holes.  Afi walked
right in here earlier&mdash;well, his Ice Assassin did, anyway.
Invisibility to get past the guards, Mind Blank to prevent the Door
Warden's True Seeing from seeing through the invisibility, some ranks
in Move Silently so as not to be heard and voil&agrave;!  Simple
infilitration of your sanctum sanctorum.  And, of course, Afi can see
the area around his Ice Assassin unless something is blocking the
view.  And once he's seen a place, he can use Scry Location to find it
again."
</p>

<p>
Over his left shoulder, a green digital readout appeared showing the
number '7'.  Immediately, there was a loud <em>Bong!</em> sound and
the number changed to '6'.
</p>

<p>
"Whoa whoa whoa, that wasn't supposed to be one of the questions!" I
yelped.
</p>

<p>
Loki raised an eyebrow at me.  "Sounded like a question to me.  And
the answer was complete and truthful.  Do you have any idea how hard
it is for me to be complete and truthful?  I'm the friggin' God of
Trickery and Lies, you idiot.  Don't push me."
</p>

<p>
I shut up instantly.
</p>

<p>
"Right, ok, fair enough," I said after a moment.  "But let's set some
ground rules.  From now on, only my questions count against the
total&mdash;you don't have to answer anyone else's, obviously.  And we
need a second scoreboard for the eight questions you owe me from the
new deal we made."  Another scoreboard, this one in blue, appeared
over his right shoulder with the number '8' displayed.
</p>

<p>
Suze leaned forward.  "Make it only when you're holding this, M'Lord,"
she whispered in my ear, passing me an inkwell.
</p>

<p>
"Suze, you're brilliant!" I told her excitedly.  "Right, Loki, it's
only one of the questions if I'm holding this inkwell.  Otherwise it's
just me talking with other people or thinking out loud, and it doesn't
count.  And I'll specify which set of questions I want to use each
time, but if I don't then it's one of the 'honest and complete and
non-deceptive' ones."
</p>

<p>
Looking like he just bit into a lemon to find half a worm, Loki
nodded.  I carefully set the inkwell on the table and slid it out of
reach.  It wouldn't do for me to start unconsciously using it as a
fidget toy and burn up our questions by mistake.
</p>

<p>
"Also, that answer wasn't complete," Unn said with a predatory smile.
"You didn't inform us of the purpose and weaknesses of the Ice
Assassin spell.  It's not one we have knowledge of, so clearly that
should have been stated in order to make the answer complete."
</p>

<p>
Loki reclined his Laz-E-Boy, popping out the footrest.  A mechanical
arm unfolded from the back, rapidly flapping a small, brightly painted
Japanese hand fan so that a cooling breeze played over his face.  A
light buzzing noise and a happy divine sigh indicated the chair's
massage feature activating.
</p>

<p>
"Sounds like a fair point to me, Loki.  Answer the lady's
question...or do you&mdash;answer the lady's question unless you
intend to break your word."  I only just caught myself from saying 'or
do you intend to break your word?'  Even while I wasn't holding the
inkwell, I shouldn't phrase things as questions unless I meant them to
be.
</p>

<p>
A long silence stretched out as we all waited breathlessly for Loki's
reaction.  It took about a thousand years, but finally he sighed,
pulled his chair erect, and rolled up to his feet.  Waves of sheer,
terrifying divine presence, heavy with with the threat of death,
rolled out from him as he stalked counterclockwise around the table.
Everyone except the Landguard were cowering in their seats; their
paladinhood allowing them to ignore the waves of fear, they raced to
block his way.  Without even breaking stride, Loki blew out a puff of
breath that sent them tumbling across the room to fetch up against the
wall with a frighteningly loud <em>crack!</em> sound.  The invisible
power of a God held them pressed against the wall, frozen in place
like insects pinned to a board.
</p>

<p>
Loki stopped when he reached Unn's chair and bent down so he was nose
to nose with her.
</p>

<p>
"Ice Assassin is a ninth level arcane spell, little mage," he told her
in a flat, lethal voice.  "It is an improved version of Simulacrum.
It creates a soulless being from snow and ice and imbues it with a
shard of another creature's life&mdash;this requires that the creator
have some physical fragment of the target to start with.  The Ice
Assassin then spends the rest of its existence attempting to find and
destroy that creature.
</p>

<p>
"The Ice Assassin has all of its target's skills and abilities, and to
everyone except its creator it looks essentially identical to the
target, although there are very small differences.  It has a permanent
Locate Creature spell, tuned to its target.  The creator of the Ice
Assassin always sees it as a statue of ice.  The creator has total
control over it; it must obey any and all orders from its creator.
What walked through your door was an Ice Assassin of Afi himself; he
created it and then ordered it to never harm him and to always act in
his best interests.
</p>


<p>
"So long as the creator is within one mile of the Ice Assassin, he has
a telepathic bond to the thing and, so long as they are on the same
plane, he can see the area around it as though he were scrying on
it. If the thing moves more than a mile away, the creator cannot see
its surrounding, or use the bond to telepathically issue it new
orders, but it must still obey his previous orders. Spells that the
creator casts on himself can be made to affect the Ice Assassin as
well, from any range.  If you kill it with fire while it's in its base
state, the thing melts harmlessly. If it's not in its base state it
burns normally, then reverts to its base state.  If you kill the base
state any other way, it explodes and throws painful ice fragments
everywhere&mdash;unless, as you surmised, you kill it inside an
antimagic field.  It cannot increase its powers or heal itself; that
requires a complicated and expensive ritual.  Now, is that
answer <em>complete</em> enough for you, Master High Mage Unn Lager,
husband of the potter Hadwin and mother of Brandt, Maartje, and Mabel,
ages nine, seventy one, and two hundred and thirty four respectively?"
</p>

<p>
Her face pale as a ghost, Unn nodded her head spastically, cowering
back in her chair.  Her eyes were fixed on Loki's like a mouse caught
by a cobra's stare and it was obvious that she couldn't look away, no
matter how hard she tried.  The odor of a privy poured off of her as
she suffered the same physical issue I had when Loki locked that gaze
on me.
</p>

<p>
Loki stared her down for a moment longer, then stalked back to his
obsidian throne and sat down.  The pi&ntilde;a colada had been
replaced by a crystal goblet full to the brim with blood.  He lifted
it to his lips, took a deep pull on it without looking away from Unn,
and set it down.  His mouth dripped with the blood for a moment until
he wiped it slowly away.
</p>

<p>
The aura of terror vanished and he leaned back against his throne,
once again smiling.  "Next question?" he asked in a genial tone that
almost-but-not-quite covered the underlying menace.
</p>

<p>
No one moved; we all just sat, panting and trying to gather our wits.
</p>

<p>
"Pr-Pres-Prestidigitation," Unn stammered.  Slowly, her robes and body
cleaned themselves; it took a while, since she was shaking so hard it
was difficult for her to aim her finger.
</p>

<p>
The Landguard climbed stiffly to their feet and resumed their prior
locations.
</p>

<p>
No one spoke for at least a minute.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps we should delay using the rest of the questions until later?
Especially if Afi is scrying us?" Drifa said faintly.  I jerked at the
mention of Afi; in the startlement of Loki's other information, I had
completely forgotten that he had told us the lich was spying on us.
</p>

<p>
Loki snorted.  "Don't be stupid.  The moment I got here, I wrapped
this place in notice-me-not.  He's currently forgotten that he was
scrying on you and is off giving orders to some minions.  Now, I'm not
in the mood to come and go at your whim, so ask your damn questions."
</p>

<p>
There was another long pause as we all gathered our wits.  A short
discussion followed as we reviewed what we wanted to know.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I leaned across the table so I could pick up the inkwell.  I
cleared my throat, and in a somewhat shaky voice I asked, "I would
like to use one of the 'honest and complete' questions, please.  What
course of action would be most effective at getting you or some other
god to give us favors, information, or other forms of support that
would increase our odds of survival and/or help us defeat our
enemies?"
</p>

<p>
Loki chuckled and the last of the menace disappeared.  The blood
became a pink Cosmopolitan in a martini glass, a froofy little teal
umbrella sticking out of it at a jaunty angle.
</p>

<p>
"Nice," he complimented me.  "Well phrased, and a good choice."  He
set the Cosmopolitan on thin air, tipped his cheap plastic lawnchair
flat back, folded his hands over his belly, and eyed the ceiling in
contemplation.
</p>

<p>
"Hm.  Well, first off, keep in mind that all of this is my personal
opinion and I might be wrong about what particular gods would want or
like.  That said, you could get any of the Team Death gods to support
you by becoming undead.  That would be easiest.  Alternatively, if you
sacrificed a few thousand babies to them and swore eternal obedience
and servitude, that would probably work too.
</p>

<p>
"Let's see, what else...?  Well, you can get favors and whatnot from
me by keeping me interested and making more progress in your war
efforts.  Being clever and doing tricky things is a good start; I
liked that orbital bombardment stunt that Jake came up with...and the
'infinite money' thing was amusing too."  He lifted his head and
nodded to Albrecht, flicking him a casual, two-fingered salute.  "Of
course, Albrecht took the cake.  Making you think he had an
overwhelming force, tricking you into surrendering, then tricking you
again into making him a Duke in a country you were obliged to protect
but didn't have the resources to rule?  Masterful.  Seriously, great
job, dude.  You totally lived up to your rep."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht still seemed a little faint, but he managed to offer a
hesitant "Thank you?"
</p>

<p>
Loki put his head down again, still thinking.  "Hm.  Shailos, of
course, is so stuck up that all you have to do is swear total fealty
to him and deny the existence of all other gods.
</p>

<p>
"Of the current Team Life gods, your best bet is probably Arros.  He's
big on anything that increases the amount of magic in the world, or
the power of magi.  Research some new spells, or trade him some more
of your tricks that require magi&mdash;something like that orbital
bombardment thing.  He'll deal, although he's stuffy about it."
</p>

<p>
Still lying down, he shrugged.  "Although, of course,
your <em>best</em> bet is Herr&uacute;n.  Once she's reified, she'll
be inherently grateful to her creators, and highly motivated to help
her worshippers."  He paused in thought.  "Although, she <em>is</em>
the Goddess of Secrets, so getting information out of her can be
tricky.  I'm honestly not sure what the best method would be; under
the current circumstances, I have no idea what she'll be like when she
reinstantiates."
</p>

<p>
The blue blueboard went <em>Bong!</em> and the number dropped to '7'.
</p>

<p>
He kicked the floor with one foot, causing his lawnchair to spin a
full circle, taking him head down, then horizontal, then stop when it
was just past perpendicular to the floor and rotate a hundred and
eighty degrees so he was facing us.  It left him still reclining
comfortably, but able to look at all of us.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, all of us are limited in what we can do," he admitted
casually.  "We can grant spells, we can answer requests for miracles
under very defined circumstances&mdash;and only when the one
requesting it is in the center of one of our holy places, or uses a
specific magical invocation.  We can manifest in our temples, or in
places where someone is threatening ascencion or otherwise poses a
danger to the world or to the gods themselves...a few other times, but
that's the main ones.  We can create artifacts&mdash;well, we can
imbue existing objects with a fragment of our power to <em>make</em>
them artifacts, although there's limits on that that I don't feel like
going into.  And there's limits on what we can actually do to
non-divinities. Moreover, there's limits on what we <em>will</em> do
to and for non-divinities...some things would upset the balance of
power too much, and we won't go there.  So, basically, don't expect us
to just solve your problems for you."
</p>

<p>
I set the inkwell down hurriedly and pushed it out of reach again.
Turning to the others, I asked, "Ok, what did we learn from that?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht, the master politician, was the first to notice the 'teams'
item.  "There are at least two teams of gods; one is oriented towards
death and one towards life.  Presumably, the 'Death' gods are the ones
supporting the drauga, and the 'Life' gods are the ones opposing them.
Quite possibly, they're using the war here as a proxy battle between
themselves.  And the fact that he called them 'teams' means that
they're actively working together, not just a group of individuals
with common interests.  Possibly it even implies some sort of
leadership hierarchy, a 'team captain' if you will."
</p>

<p>
I glanced at Loki; he was hiding his face behind his Cosmo, but I
thought I saw a tiny bit of crinkly smile lines around his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"One of the things that he wants from us is to make more progress in
our war efforts," Drifa added.  "That implies that he wants us to
succeed."
</p>

<p>
Loki coughed pointedly.  "Ahem.  Still in the room, you know?  And
what makes you think I want you to succeed?  Maybe I just find your
doomed little struggles cute."  He slurped hard on his pink Slushee,
cheeks caving in around the bright red plastic straw.
</p>

<p>
We all looked at him, then turned back to our own discussion.  "Yeah,
let's go with 'he wants us to succeed.'" I said with a nod.  "Let's be
positive."
</p>

<p>
Thomas smiled sardonically.  "Alpha Squad, gimme an attitude check
about the war!"
</p>

<p>
"It sucks!" they chorused, with the tone of someone sharing an
inside joke with friends.
</p>

<p>
Thomas flashed them a mock-fierce glare.  "Gimme a <em>positive</em>
attitude check!"
</p>

<p>
"It <em>positively</em> sucks!" they chorused gleefully.  The rest of
us laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, what else?" I asked, face still twitching in a smile.  Something
niggled for my attention.  "There was something about how he talked
about Herr&uacute;n...anyone else catch it?"
</p>

<p>
"'Once she's reified, she'll be inherently grateful to her creators,
and highly motivated to help her worshippers.'" Drifa repeated
thoughtfully.  "'Her creators' is an interesting word choice.  He
didn't say 'once <em>you</em> reify her', or 'grateful
to <em>you</em>.'"
</p>

<p>
"Implying that she might have other creators than us," Thomas mused.
</p>

<p>
Loki was ignoring us, too busy playing Simon to pay attention to what
we were saying. He was floating face-down in midair, still seated in
that cheap green-and-white plastic lawnchair.  The chunky black
plastic game hovered in front of him so that the lights faced him.
His hands moved so fast I could barely see them as he tapped the red,
green, yellow, black, and silver lights.  The beeps came so quickly
they blended together into a low electronic whine.
</p>

<p>
I frowned.  Black? Silver?  The original Simon didn't have
black <em>or</em> silver lights.
</p>

<p>
"What about the ritual?  There was something weird about it," I mused.
"Why was my sacrifice so different from everyone else's?"
</p>

<p>
The others were nodding.  "It was different in a lot of ways," Drifa
said thoughtfully.  "Bigger, obviously.  Both of them.  The colors
were strange, and there was sound."
</p>

<p>
"And ash," Unn nodded with a frown.  She seemed to have finally shaken
off the last of the terror.  "No other sacrifice left ash behind, not
even Loki's."
</p>

<p>
Frowning, I pulled up my memories of the experience.  She was right;
mine was the only one that had left physical traces.
</p>

<p>
"Suze, do you have a handkerchief?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"No, M'Lord," she said, clearly upset to have failed in her perceived
duty to be able to supply whatever I needed.  "But...will this do?"
She pulled the blue-green silk scarf off her neck and passed it to me.
</p>

<p>
"Perfect, that's even better than a handkerchief, thanks," I told her
truthfully...and because I wanted to see her smile again.  She did,
and I felt better immediately; making Suze sad was kinda like kicking
a puppy that just wanted to be your friend.  "Don't worry, I'll have
someone Prestidigitate it clean afterwards."
</p>

<p>
I laid the scarf out on the table in front of me and carefully brushed
as much of the ash off my clothes and into the scarf as I could.  Once
I had gotten all that I could off&mdash;a surprising amount,
actually&mdash;I knotted the corners of the handkerchief up and passed
it back to her.
</p>

<p>
"Could you find an alchemist and have him analyze this, please?  I
want to know what it's the ashes <em>of</em>."  She nodded, happy to
be able to help, and scooted out the door with the scarf clutched
tightly in hand.
</p>

<p>
I turned back to everyone else.  "The height of the flames probably
correlates to the importance of the secret, but the colors are what
I'm confused about.  Why did everyone get different results?"
</p>

<p>
"For that matter, are the results consistent?" Unn asked, with the
look of a researcher who'd gotten her teeth into a juicy problem.
</p>

<p>
"Easily checked," I told her.  I turned to my chief bodyguard.
"Thomas, go send a bunch of Landguard out there.  Have them sacrifice
multiple secrets&mdash;doesn't matter if they're picayune little
things like 'my favorite book when I was a kid was Clifford the Big
Red Dog.'  Just run each of them through three or four times and
record the colors.  Tell them to grab some of the general citizens and
have them do the same thing.  I want to know if people's colors vary."
</p>

<p>
Thomas nodded and sent a ghost sparrow winging off.
</p>

<p>
"While we wait, let's get some food in here.  Anyone else hungry?" I
inquired.  Immediate nods went around the table.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly realizing that we had an extra guest, I turned to Loki.  "May
I offer you anything, sir?"  The honorific seemed like a good idea,
given his recent flare of temper.  A little oil on troubled waters,
perhaps.  "I don't know if you eat or drink mortal food...I just don't
want to leave you out if you do."
</p>

<p>
Loki smiled and tapped one finger on his jaw in idle contemplation.
"I do, actually.  Hm.  How about...pizza?"  Immediately, the table was
covered in a layer of deep-dish pies, heavy on the toppings in every
imaginable combination, each better than the next.  The delicious
scent of cheese and sweet baked pineapple and roasted garlic and
sauteed mushrooms drifted into my nose like the promise of home, and I
whimpered in anticipatory gastronomic ecstacy as I reached for a slice
of the delicious&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&mdash;mushu chicken.  "Maybe Chinese?" Loki said, still tapping his
chin and gazing at the ceiling in thought.  "No, not that. Indian?" he
mused, as it all vanished to be replaced by curries, kormas, naan,
dosas, and every other form of scrumptious deliciousness...which
instantly vanished again.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, wait!" he cried happily.  "Thai!  I love Thai!"  The table was
now groaning under an assortment of curries, rice, noodle dishes, and
soups. A cheap plastic cup in the center of the table held the kind of
paper-wrapped breakapart chopsticks that you get in a streetcorner
asian fusion place.
</p>

<p>
We all paused to see if the food was going to change again.  When Loki
served himself a heaping portion of rice and poured red chicken curry
over it, we all shrugged and dove in.  I was still thinking murderous
thoughts at the cruel, cruel person who had snatched away my luscious
pizza.  Still, if I wasn't getting pizza then Thai was a good second choice.
</p>

<p>
I rapidly learned two things: watching paladins attempt to eat with
chopsticks is hilarious.  Also, Loki's curries were ohmygodthat'shot
hot.
</p>

<p>
"Something wrong?" he asked innocently as my face turned red and tears
ran from my eyes and smoke blew out my ears with a steamwhistle sound.
</p>

<p>
Well, ok, maybe not the smoke.
</p>

<p>
"It's a little hot," I whimpered, chugging water between words.
"Maybe you could tone it down a little?"  My words were rendered
indistinct by the amount of pain I was in.  I was sure that there were
vegetables in there...the thing couldn't really be <em>pure</em>
capsaicin, no matter what it felt like.
</p>

<p>
He sighed dramatically but flicked his fingers.  Green sparkles
drifted over the food and it suddenly became edible.  He was even nice
enough to get rid of the lethal burning flame of firey burning painful
agony that was searing its way through my mouth and down my gullet.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," I told him gratefully.
</p>

<p>
"Don't mention it," he grumbled.  Flicking a glance up at me he
continued.  "Seriously, don't.  If the other gods knew that I was
wussying up the food like this, I'd never hear the end of it."
</p>

<p>
I made a zipping gesture across my lips.  "Mum's the word."  I went
back to watching Thomas fumble with the chopsticks; he was doing
better than he had been, at least.  Now he was managing to get an
average of five or six grains of rice in his mouth each time.
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
Partway through the meal, a ghost sparrow appeared, hovering in front
of Thomas.  In a deep, masculine voice that I didn't recognize it
said, "Landguard always get white-gold.  Ten citizen subjects colors
consistent: five white-gold, two blue, three green.  Citizens vary:
gender, age, profession, etc."
</p>

<p>
Further discussion yielded no ideas.  Partway through the talking,
Suze came back in.
</p>

<p>
"M'Lord, I spoke with Master Alchemist Ukrit," she told me quickly,
wringing her hands slightly in nervousness as everyone stopped eating
to listen to her.  "He said that the ash is from some kind of
animal&mdash;it's a mix of flesh and bones, burnt so fast and so hot
that there wasn't anything left but the ash.  He's working on figuring
out what the animal might have been, but he said it will take a
while."
</p>

<p>
I don't know why, but I glanced over at Loki.  He seemed bored; he had
pushed all his silverware to the right side of his plate and was
carefully aligning it such that the spoon was <em>precisely</em> the
same distance from the knife as the knife was from the salad fork as
the salad fork was from the dinner fork and all of them were precisely
parallel.  He caught me looking and immediately turned his attention
back to his silverware, continuing to align it perfectly with the edge
of the table.
</p>

<p>
I stared; there was some sort of clue here, but I couldn't.... 
</p>

<p>
"Alignment.  What alignment were the citizens?  Did people of the same
alignments get the same colors?" I demanded, suddenly getting it.
</p>

<p>
A quick exchange of ghost sparrows and the results were in.
"Landguard and citizens: lawful good.  Citizens: two chaotic good,
three neutral good.  White-gold, blue, green."
</p>

<p>
Everyone was nodding.  "Lord Loki, I believe you stated you were True
Neutral?" Drifa asked with careful courtesy.  Everyone was still
walking on eggshells around the mercurial deity.
</p>

<p>
Lightning bolts danced around Loki, none of them touching him.  "Yep!
Not an ounce of charge anywhere!"  
</p>

<p>
"You positive?" I asked him, straightfaced.
</p>

<p>
He flashed a grin at me.  "Totally.  By the way, are those curries ok
for you now?  If not, I can Coulumb down some more."
</p>

<p>
I snickered.  "That pun was pretty good but I bet Joule top it before
the evening's over."
</p>

<p>
Thomas, Drifa, and Unn were staring back and forth at us in confusion.
Suze just wore a patient expression as she waited for me to stop
speaking gibberish.
</p>

<p>
"Gettin' some punning skills there, bucko," Loki congratulated me.  "I
can see I'm gonna have to keep an ion you!"  He teleported across the
table to slap me on the back; I saw Thomas stiffen and Alpha Squad
shift forward onto the balls of their feet.  Fortunately, none of them
did anything and Loki teleported back to his chair immediately.
</p>

<p>
Words related to electricity were popping up in my head, arranging
themselves neatly into a relationship graph, related concepts and
names tying themselves onto each of the words, the graph spreading
outwards faster and faster.  It was all laid out for my easy
reference, a seemingly endless well of puns to draw upon.  God, I
loved being smart.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, I was also smart enough to quit while I was ahead.  The
whole point had been to make Loki laugh, and to let him win.  I didn't
want another display like the earlier one; I wasn't sure we'd survive
it.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I am bested!" I cried, hamming it up and clutching at my chest as
though skewered to the heart.  I collapsed melodramatically to the
table, lay there for a second, and then sat up straight.
</p>

<p>
Loki was snickering at my antics and lounging in his chair, pleased
with himself.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, so it looks like the colors coordinate to alignments," I
remarked, turning serious again.  "Lawful good is white-gold, chaotic
good is blue, neutral good is green, true neutral is silver.  There's
probably some sort of 'ocean is chaotic, nature is neutral' symbolism
there. Does everyone else's alignment match the color they got?"  I
looked around the table, getting a nod from everyone...except Unn.
</p>

<p>
"My color was silver, but I'm lawful neutral, not true neutral," she
said worriedly.  "Although, my color was a lighter silver than Lord
Loki's, so perhaps that still matches."
</p>

<p>
"Wait," Thomas said with a frown.  "The flames were always black,
except for when Loki and Jake sacrificed.  Then they were normal fire
color.  What does that signify?"
</p>

<p>
I frowned in thought.  "Well...."  I stopped, having nowhere to go
from there.
</p>

<p>
We hashed it around but no one had any ideas.  Finally, I reluctantly
picked up the inkwell and turned to Loki.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to use an 'honest and complete' question, please," I began.
"What information exists related to the ritual that it would be useful
for us to know?"  I carefully set the inkwell down as soon as I
stopped talking.
</p>

<p>
Loki smiled like a cat.  "I'm not going to answer that one," he told
us, taking a swig directly from his cut-crystal decanter of Cire
Perdue.
</p>

<p>
"Huh," I muttered.  I hadn't been expecting that.  I ruminated on it
for a minute, then had a bright idea.
</p>

<p>
"I have seven questions left from our first deal," I began slowly.  I
wasn't totally sure that I wanted to do this, but it seemed like a
good idea.  "That deal said that you had to be truthful, although it
allowed you to be deceptive...but it did <em>not</em> allow you to
refuse to answer.  So, I have a question for you: what is the answer
to a question so phrased that the answer to the question would contain
all of the information that would be contained in a full and complete
and non-deceptive answer to my previous question in which I asked
'what information exists related to the ritual that it would be useful
for us to know?'"
</p>

<p>
Loki calmly continued eating from his box of chocolates, still using
his curry-stained chopsticks.  "I don't have to answer that," he told
me, an annoying hint of glee leaching into his voice.
</p>

<p>
I scowled.  I was so <em>sure</em> I had him!  That recursive question
should have gotten us the info we needed.
</p>

<p>
"You weren't holding the inkwell," Albrecht pointed out.  "You said
earlier that it wasn't one of your questions unless you were holding
the inkwell."
</p>

<p>
I cursed, snatched up the inkwell and repeated my question.  
</p>

<p>
Loki leaned back in his chair and propped his boots up on the table,
legs casually crossed at the ankles.  He laced his fingers behind his
head and puffed on his corncob pipe for a bit.
</p>

<p>
"Well now, that's a poser, ain't it?" he asked.  "Yep, definitely a
poser."
</p>

<p>
He tipped his chair back on two legs and sat there, rocking back and
forth slightly in thought as the ceiling above him slowly turned into
a smog cloud.  Fortunately, he was polite enough to be sure that all
the smoke stayed stuck together in a cotton-candy-sized ball.
</p>

<p>
"'What information exists related to the ritual that it would be
useful for you to know?'  Hm."  He rocked a bit more before
continuing.  "I suppose," he said thoughtfully.  "That there's
information about why the flames were sometimes black except when I
was there or Jake was turning them into blowtorches.  And what the
black signifies, given the other colors.  And how that ties together
with the ash.  Oh, and probably something about what you should expect
as the result of the ritual and why."  He paused again, seemingly lost
in thought.
</p>

<p>
After a moment he nodded decisively, dropping his feet to the floor
with a <em>clop</em> and sitting up straight.  "Yep.  That's pretty
much everything that I can think of as far as information that exists
that is both related to the ritual and useful for you to know."
</p>

<p>
The number on the green scoreboard <em>ding!</em>ed and dropped to '5'.
</p>

<p>
It took a long minute but I finally realized that he wasn't going to
continue; instantly, I cursed as I saw my mistake.  I hadn't asked him
to <em>provide</em> the information, I had only asked what
information <em>existed</em>.  Damnit.
</p>

<p>
I sighed.  This was going to be a long night.
</p>

<p>
"In a society without death, Ingfred is 20 years old and has no
prospects. All the good jobs are filled by undying masters of their
craft, and it's hard to be taken seriously when you are, compared to
everyone around you, an infant.  Fortunately, he has a solution:
undergo an illegal transformation and sell the memory to The

<p>
There's two problems: how can Ingfred convince a powerful wizard to

And, once that's done...how will Ingfred deal with the law?"
