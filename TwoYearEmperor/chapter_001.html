<hr />

<p>
Someone smashed me in the head with a big fractal brick.
</p>

<p>Suddenly, I wasn't standing munching a tasty croissant at my
favorite bakery anymore. I was falling...about a foot, to land flat on
my back on a deep pile of cushions.
</p>
  
<p>
As I hit, someone poured half a gallon of LSD into my eyeballs.  The
sound of red and the color of salty exploded in my brain; words I'd
never heard slammed through my ears and beat Broca and Wernicke to a
bleeding pulp.  Pages of non-existent books and maps and clay tablets
and scrolls spun past too fast to see.  Horrific monsters, all teeth
and claws and wings and talons and spikes, sprang at me from all
directions, passed through me and fought one another amidst terrifying
roars.
</p>
<p>
After an eon or six, it stopped.
</p>

<p>
Blinking, I looked around to see what had happened.  Then I blinked
some more and rubbed my eyes.  Nope, still there&mdash;not just a
hallucination.  I really was in a chilly stone room, the floor around
me really did have a giant pentacle engraved into it, and there really
were runes inscribed all over the walls, floor, and ceiling.  The
whole place looked like it should be on the cover of a Black Sabbath
album.
</p>

<p>
As long as we were counting 'really's, I really wasn't alone in this
vaguely creepy piece of album art.  I was surrounded by three old
bearded guys in silk bathrobes, and behind them were half a dozen very
scary-looking men in honest-to-god chainmail, with a sword in each
hand, eyes fixed on the men in bathrobes.
</p>

<p>
"Welcome, My Lord," said the old guy with the longest beard.  He
managed to fit more pomposity into three words than appeared in an
average high school valedictorian speech.  "You are in no danger, and
we are at your service.  I am sure you have many questions, and we
will be delighted to answer them for you.  We have provided a variety
of food and drinks if you would like a meal."  He gestured behind me;
I turned to see a narrow wooden credenza looking very out of place
against the rear wall; it was piled high with the sort of spread you
typically only see at really fancy weddings.
</p>
<p>
I was nauseous, my head hurt like it was under a piledriver, and I was
so exhausted my brain felt like a fogbank.
</p>

  <p><em>~Dehydration headache and hunger~</em> I realized dimly,
knowing the signs from plenty of days when I was lost in a project and
I forgot to eat.  Moving was the last thing I wanted to do, but I
dragged myself over to the credenza, mechanically chewed a few grapes,
and forced myself to swallow.  Instantly, the nausea converted to
hunger and I started gobbling down bread, cheese, and fruit.  After
multiple large handfuls I grabbed a pint mug of water, slammed it
back, refilled it from the pitcher, slammed that, and drank a third a
bit more slowly.
</p>
<p>
As always after a refueling session like that, the headache dimmed to
a bearable level and I knew it would be gone in a few minutes.  The
hunger was gone but I felt unpleasantly bloated, like someone had
force-fed me with a tube.  <em>~Too much, too fast~</em> I admitted to
myself, exactly like I always did.  Vowed not to do it again, exactly
like I always did.  Knew that I would, exactly like I always did.  On
the upside, my brain was working again.
</p>
<p>
I hadn't noticed their approach, but there were two of the chainmail
types standing by me, one on either side, facing out with blades in
hand and staring at the bathrobe-clad oldsters with a look much like
that of a tiger who was pretty sure he was going to eat you in a
moment but hadn't <em>quite</em> decided.  The other four were behind
and beside the bathrobe brigade with exactly the same look.  A
blinking neon sign over their heads saying "paranoid elite bodyguard"
would have been completely superfluous.
</p>
<p>
What the hell?
</p>
<p>
The three bathrobed gentlemen were looking at me, but waiting
patiently for me to get my bearings.  The swordsmen were still
standing right behind them, staring at Long-beard and friends, swords
in hand.
</p>
<p>
"Ok, what is going on?  Where am I, and why am I here?"
</p>
<p>
The central bathrobe guy (<em>~aww, hell, just admit it, he's a
wizard~</em>) smiled, bowed very slightly, and said "You are in the
castle at the center of Capital City, the first and largest city in
the Kingdom of Flobovia, on a Prime Material Plane parallel to your
own.  I and my fellow Archmagi"&mdash;he gestured at the two others
standing beside him&mdash;"have summoned you across the Void to be
the absolute ruler of our nation for the next two years.  Your rule
is, I regret, compulsory, but at the end of the two years, you will be
laden with riches and our deepest thanks, and then released."
</p>
<p>
I blinked at him, then asked about the single most crucial point.
"Flobovia?"
</p>
<p>
He looked a bit embarrassed.  "Yes, well, it is a rather silly
name...the ruler ten years ago was named Flob Arten&mdash;quite a
common name on his plane, I gather&mdash;and he changed the name of
the nation.  No ruler since then has cared to change it back, and no
one else has the authority to do so."
</p>
<p>
"So...basically, the kingdom is named something like 'Bobville'," I
stated, unbelieving.
</p>
<p>
One of the other wizards chuckled.  "Hazards of an absolute dictator,
I'm afraid.  In general, the system works very well; we get a constant
supply of new ideas, new technologies, new ways of doing things, and
an overlord with the power to see them put into effect quickly.  The
terms of the Summoning ritual prevent us from getting anyone deranged
or brain damaged, but we do occasionally get rulers who are foolish,
stupid, or unkind."
</p>
<p>
I frowned in puzzlement.  "When you get someone like that, why don't
you just send them home and try again?"
</p>
<p>
The bodyguard furthest from me answered without ever taking his eyes
off the wizard whom he was clearly ready to puree.  "Because the
Landguard would kill anyone who tried.  The ruler holds power for two
full turning of the seasons.  So it is writ."
</p>
<p>
I digested that.  "So, a bunch of wizards kidnapped a perfectly
ordinary guy off the street, brought him to Bobville&mdash;excuse me,
'Flobovia'&mdash;to be their absolute ruler, to shower with jewels and
power and obey his every whim, and he has a bunch of super-lethal
bodyguards fanatically dedicated to him from the moment he shows up
despite the fact that they know absolutely nothing about him and he
could be a complete fool."
</p>
<p>
Long-beard looked a bit embarrassed.  "Well, um...yes?"
</p>
<p>
"And Capital City is the capital city of the nation?"
</p>
<p>
Long-beard was now red as a tomato.  "Um...yes?"
</p>
<p>
I just nodded, still in a bit of shock.  "You realize this sounds like
the plot to a really hackneyed piece of fanfic, right?  Likely some
sort of self-insert Mary Sue crap.  Do you have Rainbow Dash, Twilight
Sparkle, and the other My Little Ponies down in the royal stable?"
</p>
<p>
Even the bodyguards looked at me in bewilderment. 
</p>
<p>
The wizard who had chuckled before spoke slowly.  "I'm...afraid I
don't know how to get you a dash of rainbows, My Lord, but we'd be
happy to find you some ponies if that's acceptable.  If you don't mind
a suggestion, though&mdash;perhaps you'd like to relocate to a more
comfortable location for the rest of this conversation?  The Work Room
is excellent for rituals, but remarkably lacking in chairs."  His lips
quirked in humor at the last, and I decided I liked this guy.
</p>
<p>
I shrugged bewildered acceptance and gestured towards the door.
"After you."
</p>
<p>
As the wizards turned away, the Landguard troopers relaxed very
slightly.  It suddenly hit me that they had been expecting me to be
angry and order the deaths of my summoners...and that they would have
done it.  I resolved to be very, very careful about what I said and
did; I didn't want some poor chambermaid getting massacred just
because she startled me in the shower.
</p>

<p>
<em>~Do they even have showers here?~</em> I wondered idly as I
followed the Archmagi down the hall.
