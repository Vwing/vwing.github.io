<p>
Down the canyon, Icefi was busily drawing a circle in the dirt, taking
great care to make it as perfect as possible.  The rest of us stood
back by the door to Gr&#491;fhamr, heads together in a quick huddle.
</p>

<p>
"Right, everyone got both your marbles?" I asked for the fifth time.
The Landguard kept a professionally stoic face&mdash;all except for
Duncan, whom I had flat ordered Thomas to bring along.  He glared at
me, and I could almost hear his thoughts: <em>stop wittering like a
mother hen and get on with it.</em>  All of the non-Landguard just
rolled their eyes and pulled back their sleeves to show the marble
Sovereign Glued to their left forearm and the one held carefully in
their hand.
</p>

<p>
"<em>Yes,</em> Jake, we remember," Unn said with obviously forced
patience.  "Keep hold of the second marble.  Don't drop it
accidentally or we all get teleported back here.  If there's any
danger or you even think there might be, drop your marble and we'll
all be yanked back here.  Be sure that the one on your arm doesn't get
removed or you won't be touching a marble when you drop one and so you
won't be teleported.  If the marbles fail, activate the shirt button
and go ethereal. If <em>that</em> fails, activate the <em>left</em>
toe ring to Plane Shift to the Astral, then activate
the <em>right</em> toering to Greater Planeshift back to the Prime
Material.  We <em>know.</em>"
</p>

<p>
"Unn, you forgot the toothcaps!" Drifa admonished her.  "Remember,
don't eat anything while we're there, because if you bite down too
hard on the right side it will Greater Teleport you home, as long as
you're on the Prime Material and not in an extradimensional space."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht nodded with unconvincing solemnity.  "And you absolutely must
remember your belt buckle&mdash;it's a single-use Shapechange spell;
just twist it clockwise to activate it.  Your best bet is probably to
turn into a shadow or a wraith so that you can blend in."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," Reynard answered with equally false seriousness.  "Failing
that, however, chronotyryns are a good choice for both combat and
escape because they have two actions per round.  And, of course,
chronotyryns look like&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;a bird twelve feet from beak to tail," Thomas picked it up
without a pause.  "It has a raptor-like beak and arms sprouting from
under its wings.  The overall color is&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;that of adamantine, because that is what the feathers are
composed of," Drifa continued again, nodding sagely.  "Of course,
there are other good choices aside from chronotyryns, such as trumpet
archons, which have a permanent&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;magic circle against evil which will hedge out most of our
opponents.  More importantly though, they have at-will Greater
Teleport which should let you escape from almost anything, unless you
find yourself in a Dimensional Lock, which is a good time to use the
Dispel Magic spell that's in the green charm on your bracelet; just
name your target, then break the charm off."
</p>

<p>
I grimaced and rubbed my neck in embarrassment.  "Right, sorry.  I may
have repeated all that a bit much."  Every single one of the others
gave me a speaking look that practically shouted <em>ya think?!</em>
I raised my hands placatingly.  "Ok, ok, definitely repeated it too
many times.  Now, here's the plan."  At my gesture, Suze produced a
sheet of carefully-folded paper from her Belt of Many Pouches and
passed it around.  Everyone was very careful to open it only the
tiniest bit to make it as hard as possible for anyone scrying us to
see what was written on it.
</p>

<p>
Isaac read the paper, passed it to Unn, and then stared at me in
squint-eyed distrust.  "What does <em>that</em> mean?" he demanded
suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
I shrugged.  "I promise, it won't harm any of us.  And, even if it all
goes wildly wrong, I'll be standing right next to you.  Whatever
happens, I'll be affected just as much as you."
</p>

<p>
He glared at me for another long moment, then <em>hmphed</em> in
disgust and let it go.
</p>

<p>
"Everyone got it?" I asked, looking around the circle.  I got a bunch
of puzzled frowns back, but they all nodded.  They didn't
understand <em>why</em> I was asking for this, but at least they
understood <em>what</em> I was asking for.
</p>

<p>
I glanced over my shoulder; Icefi had finished scattering amber dust
in a careful layer across the area of the circle and was standing on
the edge of it, chanting with skeletal hands upraised.  The circle was
beginning to glow a soft blue.
</p>

<p>
"Time to go," I said, straightening up with a soft sigh and a knot in
my stomach.  It was time for the Rousing Speech.  I'd put it together
last night and was proud of it.  It was a mosaic of the best and
brightest, the most inspiring battle addresses of my world: "we band
of brothers" and "this, our finest hour," and "Death said that he and
his were going to waltz through Gr&#491;fhamr, and we choked him with
those words.  We have done the impossible, and that makes us mighty.
Today is our chance...and he won't see <em>this</em> coming."
</p>

<p>
I was ready to give the speech, to inspire them...and suddenly the
reality of my situation hit me.  We were about to go walk into the
arms of the <em>oldest lich in the world</em> and try to do a deal
with him so that he would get us an audience with <em>Death</em> so
that we could get rid of him...or have him kill us, one or the other.
My throat locked in a knot of near-terror.  I couldn't make a sound; I
just stood there with my mouth open while they all <em>looked at
me,</em> waiting to hear what I'd started to say.  I could feel my
uncertainty starting to spread to them as they waited...and
waited...and waited.
</p>

<p>
I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, reaching for that armor of
mental ice that had carried me through so many crises in this world
and in my own...and it wouldn't come.  My failure to find it made my
stomach knot up even worse as panic washed in; for a moment I teetered
right on the edge of losing it completely.  Jesus Christ, what was
I <em>doing</em>?  Every god I had interacted with had crushed me
utterly; even Loki, one of the <em>lesser</em> gods, had left me
quaking in helpless terror with a simple glance.  How the hell did I
think I could take on the literal God of Death???
</p>

<p>
I grabbed my fear and twisted it, turning it into anger at myself.
Rage flooded through me&mdash;how dared I panic at this moment?
Everyone else was fine, what was my problem?  Why was <em>I</em>
special, what did I get to hold up a stress card right now?  The rage
leaped higher; it swept the fear aside like a blowtorch burning away
cobwebs. I felt my spine straighten and my face firm up as fire roared
across my soul.  I let it wash through me, focusing it like a laser on
my enemies: death and its embodiment.  The loss of human lives and all
the joyous potential enshrined within them.  The mockery of life into
which Neklos&mdash;that infuriating, psychotic, megalomaniac, childish
Invisble Sky Daddy&mdash;had twisted those bright sparks.  The deaths
of countless civilization that He had caused, over and over, across
multiple eons.  Most of all, I let myself rage against the stupidity
and selfishness of the gods and their insane petty politics that
inflicted such horror upon those who should be their charges.  My
humility, my uncertainty, my fear, my belief that some obstacles could
not be overcome, my desire to be liked instead of obeyed&mdash;I
crushed them to the earth and ground them beneath my heel.  My eyes
snapped open.
</p>

<p>
"Let's go kick some ass," I told them with a bared-teeth expression
that bore no relation to a smile.
</p>

<hr width="20%" />

<p>
Apparently I wasn't the only one feeling a need to play mother hen,
because Icefi was repeating everything he'd told us last night,
looking around the circle to ensure that each of us had understood and
acknowledged.
</p>

<p>
"Again, I can't go with you," he told us.  "The Creator ordered me and
the rest of the Free Corps to never come within a mile of him, so
you'll need to make your own way.  Remember to hold your hands up and
away from your body as you pass through the Circle.  When you arrive,
you will be in the Creator's receiving room.  It's heavily defended,
and the defenders will attack immediately if they see anything they
interpret as even possibly hostile.  Someone will step forward to
ensure that you aren't carrying any weapons.  Don't move until they
say you can or you'll be attacked."  He paused, glancing at the
Landguard's empty sheaths. "You <em>aren't</em> carrying any weapons,
right?" he asked, suspicion clearly evident in his sepulchral voice.
</p>

<p>
Duncan grunted, shooting me a disgusted look.  He had been delighted
and grateful to be put back on active duty...and promptly infuriated
when I told him that he needed to disarm.  It had actually been pretty
funny&mdash;once he finally accepted the order, he handed over both
his swords and a dagger from his sleeve.  Thomas had cleared his
throat significantly; Duncan had looked at him in betrayal and pulled
a knife from each boot and one from a sheathe on his back in what I
liked to think of as 'Yippee-kai-ay' position.  A raised eyebrow from
his Commander got a pair of brass knuckles added to the pile...and two
daggers from the small of his back...and a thin-bladed knife hidden
under his bracer...and an adamantine garrote that was stitched to the
inside of his belt...and a ring that sprouted a small needle when the
stone was twisted...and&mdash;well, suffice it to say that it took a
little while for him to disarm.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we all remember this," Thomas said patiently.  "Yes, we have all
disarmed."  He gestured to the empty sheaths on his, Duncan, and Alpha
Squad's hips.
</p>

<p>
Icefi looked at all of us one last time, then nodded his skull.
"Teleportation Circle," he declared, in a voice that made reality
twist around us.  The blue-glowing circle on the ground flared for a
moment, then faded as the spell was completed.
</p>

<p>
"Take your places," he said, waving us all to the perimeter of the
circle.
</p>

<p>
I moved to my position between Thomas and Duncan, only to feel a
slight bump against my elbow.  Turning, I saw Suze squeezing in on my
left.
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely not," I told her firmly.  "Get back inside."
</p>

<p>
She gave me a mulish look, folding her arms across her chest and
scowling.  "I am the Imperial Executive Assistant, Order of the Golden
Pen!  It's my job to be beside you so that I can <em>assist!</em>"
</p>

<p>
"No. Way."  I shook my head.  "Get back to the city and get out of
sight.  This is no place for a noncombatant.  Shoot, <em>I</em>
wouldn't be going if there was an option."
</p>

<p>
She was trying to look firm, but I could see 'scared' and 'upset'
fighting their way to the surface.  "But&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Go back to the city, Suze," Thomas told her firmly.  "You are of the
Land, and I will not allow you to be harmed.  If you were to come, you
would only be a distraction."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;" she tried to object.  Finally she slumped in defeat.
"Fine," she grumbled, stepping back from the circle.  "I'll just stay
here, worrying that you're all going to die and I'm going to have to
wait, not knowing, until we all get eaten by monsters and turned into
undead horrors."
</p>

<p>
I blinked and grinned despite myself.  "Wow!  Someone took twenty
ranks in Perform (Guilt Trip)!"
</p>

<p>
She shot me a sour look and sniffed, trying to look offended.  She
couldn't hold the look for more than a moment before her expression
softened into worry.  "Come back, M'Lord.  The Land needs you."
</p>

<p>
The fury-born confidence had mostly faded now, but from somewhere I
mustered up a cocky smile and a jaunty salute.  "That's the plan,
darlin'," I told her.  "Tell the kitchen to do roast beef for
lunch&mdash;we'll be back before it's ready to eat."
</p>

<p>
She raised her hand in a tiny little wave; I winked at her and stepped
through the portal.
</p>

<p>
One stride forward&mdash;a sense of stretching, of my legs lengthening
as though I wore thousand-league boots&mdash;and I was standing in a
stone room the size of a soccer field, the ceiling towering forty feet
overhead.  Before my eyes could adjust to the dim, shadowy light, I
felt Duncan, Thomas, and Alpha Squad slot into place around me.  They
were disarmed and had their hands raised, but they were still
interposing their armored bodies between me and any possible threat.
</p>

<p>
I nearly fell over as a soft, feminine weight stumbled against my back.
</p>

<p>
"Goddamnit, Suze&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
"Arrivals will be still!" came a hundred voices, all speaking in
perfect unison.  From the dimness around us floated five score Afis,
several hundred floating black-metal golems with long arms ending in
wicked claws...and more undead shadows than I could count.
</p>

<p>
"Well, ain't that a thing," Duncan muttered.
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
The inspection was minute; they verified that there were no weapons on
any of us.  They found the marbles concealed in our hands and pockets;
the ones we had held concealed in our hands and our pockets were found
and removed.  The ones Sovereign Glued to our arms were cut
loose&mdash;they allowed the Landguard to heal us afterwards.  They
found the Shirt Buttons of Etherealness that had been our backup
escape plan.  They found everything, including the magic toothcaps and
the invisible enchanted toe rings we were all wearing, both of which
were equipped with Mystic Aura spells so they didn't show up to Detect
Magic.
</p>

<p>
How did they find all our most carefully hidden items, you might ask?
Simple.
</p>

<p>
"Mindscrape," said a dozen of the Ice Assassins as they took up
positions around us.  My memories and those of all my companions were
laid bare before them.  Our plans, our clever preparations, our every
secret spilled into their hands like the jackpot from a slot machine.
They saw my arrival in Flobovia, they saw my scientific knowledge,
they saw the nature and methods of orbital bombardment, they saw all
the details of how to free Afi from the godshard.  They saw the
existence of the marbles and all of the other items.  They saw the
Belt of Many Pockets that Suze wore below the non-magical pouch at her
hip.  They saw the multitude of shrunken-holy-water-filled Portable
Holes that each of had hidden around our persons, disguised as simple
clothing.  They even saw the key that Loki had given me which granted
access to the invisible, undetectable-because-<em>god</em>,
anti-magical extradimensional emergency bunker where several hundred
Landguard waited alongside piles of all Thomas and the others' weapons
and enough healing potions, wands, scrolls, staves, and other gear to
fight a medium-sized war.  They saw all of that, and they stripped it
all away, passing it off to some of their number to be carried away to
safe storage well away from us.
</p>

<p>
As if that weren't enough, the Icefi clones dumped eighty or ninety
Mage's Disjunction spells on us until it was virtually certain that
any magic items they could conceivably have missed had been rendered
thoroughly mundane.
</p>

<p>
It wasn't just our possessions that they took or destroyed.  They saw
all the exploitable details of our relationships&mdash;my lingering
fury at how Isaac and Reynard had edited my memories, my simultaneous
respect for Thomas and fear of the violence he was capable of, the
dislike and borderline contempt that I bore for Colborn...even my
exasperated-but-slightly-proud anger at Suze for sneaking along with
us instead of staying put at Gr&#491;fhamr like I'd goddamn well told
her to.
</p>

<p>
I tried to at least conceal our go-to-hell plan&mdash;Scrying to
locate us, followed by orbital bombardment with antimatter osmium
penetrators&mdash;but the spell brushed my efforts aside with
contemptuous ease and ripped the details out of my agonized brain.
</p>

<p>
Once they were confident that we had been rendered as harmless as
possible, we were hustled along a ridiculously wide corridor covered
in elegant tapestries and statuary.  Our escorts were carefully
interleaved among us&mdash;each of us walked in a box consisting of
one of Afi's Ice Assassins to left and right, a pair of those shadowy
floating metallic constructs in front and behind, and a round dozen
Greater Shadows filling in the corners.  It was abundantly clear that
we were prisoners, not guests, and that if any of us tried anything
that our captors didn't like, we'd be dead before we could blink.
</p>

<p>
By the time we were in sight of the portal that lead to Afi's throne
room, I was thoroughly disheartened.  I'd brainstormed a lot of
different defenses, and thought I'd covered the bases.I was
frantically scrabbling around in the back of my head, looking for some
sort of leverage to make this end in anything but a Total Party
Kill...forget trying to <em>win</em>, at this point, I just wanted
to <em>escape.</em>  I glanced around at my companions, hoping for
some sort of inspiration.
</p>

<p>
Thomas was the kind of person who got calmer as things got worse; by
the time we walked through the archway into the throne room, I suspect
his heart rate was somewhere around forty beats a minute.  I couldn't
do that.
</p>

<p>
Duncan, on the other hand, was fulminating. I couldn't do that.
</p>

<p>
Suze was terrified.  I could absolutely do that.
</p>

<p>
The archway leading to Afi's throne room was filled with a shimmering
curtain of rippling light that just screamed 'extradimensional
portal.'  My heart sank when I saw it&mdash;so much for the idea of
the Gr&#491;fhamrites being able to Scry us so they could rescue
us...or even target the area for orbital bombardment.  It had been a
faint hope, but at least a hope.
</p>

<p>
We transitioned through the portal and I felt my heart quail; the room
was designed to impress and oh boy did it succeed.  As long as a
soccer field, a hundred feet wide, eighty feet high, giant buttresses
like ribs soaring across the span of the roof.  The floor was a
perfectly flat plane of perfectly hexagonal tiles the size of a dinner
plate, each so precisely identical that they fit together with hardly
a space between them.  They came in subtly different shades of grey,
lighter by the door and sweeping in a darkening wave that dragged the
eye forcibly towards the dias at the end where Afi lounged upon his
throne.
</p>

<p>
That room would have been intimidating enough empty, but it wasn't
empty. The walls were lined with rank upon rank of midnight-skinned
drow, rocky svirfneblin, pebble-skinned troglodytes, and creatures I'd
never even heard of.  Thousands of their flat, cold eyes turned to see
us escorted up the room.  Above their heads, looking down with
watchful threat, floated scores of Icefis and even more of those
floating golems.
</p>

<p>
Our escorts spread out, allowing us to move together while they formed
a perimeter between us and the creatures on the walls.  We advanced in
an open box&mdash;our monstrous captors to the sides and behind.  I
found myself stumbling slightly, my knees getting a little wobbly, and
my head turning back and forth as I looked around in growing
desperation for anything that could be exploited for an advantage.
</p>

<p>
Thomas and Duncan closed ranks to my left and right.  Alpha Squad took
up position in a trailing wedge with us at the point, herding Suze and
the others into the middle.  Every Landguard stepped off on the left
foot, their hobnailed boots slamming into the paving stones with
a <em>crash</em> that managed to be intimidating even in these
conditions.  In perfect synch they led us up the aisle; instinctively,
all of us fell into step.  Bound together by the unstoppable certainty
of their tread, buoyed up by the aura of courage and hope that they
pushed out from behind implacable expressions, we went up the room as
a disciplined force, not as a stumbling mass of frightened prisoners.
</p>

<p>
We reached the dias together and stopped with a final crashing step
that echoed in the sudden silence.
</p>

<p>
Afi gazed down at us from above like a god in judgement, allowing the
moment to linger until the tension could be cut with a knife.  Wrapped
in the aura of courage that flowed from my paladins, I was left
untouched by what should have been a frightening moment.  Instead, I
stood serene, my mind ticking through possibilities with efficient
speed.  Force was out; only diplomacy and strategy remained, and I
intended to wring every possible advantage from them.  Everything I
knew about Afi spread itself out in a neat grid in my mind, every fact
and speculation fitting into a neat web as I searched for the lever
that would let me move him to the path I wanted...the path where we
all ended up alive and Neklos ended up dead.
</p>

<p>
After at least a minute of ominous, looming silence, Afi spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Prismatic Wall."
</p>

<p>
A brightly shimmering rainbow wall leaped into existence fifty feet
behind us, stretching from wall to wall and floor to ceiling.  Sight
and sound of the room beyond the wall was shut off like flipping a
switch.  Isaac raised an eyebrow at that and Unn blinked in surprise.
Reynard looked somewhere between impressed and awed.
</p>

<p>
Afi got to his feet and stared down at us.
</p>

<p>
"So.  My Ice Assassins told me your plan to separate me from the
godshard, and your idea for how to deal with Death.  Explain to me why
I need you now."
</p>

"when you drop a marble you aren't touching it so don't get

"In a society without death, Ingfred is 20 years old and has no
