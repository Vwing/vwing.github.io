<p>
"How ya doin', kiddo?" Loki asked, squashing Herr&uacute;n in a giant
bearhug.
</p>

<p>
"Oof!" she grunted, all the air squished out of her.  She pushed
futilely at his arms.  "Daaaddyyy!" she moaned in embarrassment.  "Not
in front of everyone!"
</p>

<p>
"om nom nom nom!" Loki nom'd, nibbling all over her ears and head like
a proud parent playing with a baby.
</p>

<p>
"<strong>Ahem,</strong>" said Amilsandre, frowning impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"Right, sorry!" Loki said, letting Herr&uacute;n go with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
For her part, Herr&uacute;n just seemed amused by Amilsandre's
impatience.  "Don't get your knickers in a twist, sis," she said with
a wicked smile.
</p>

<p>
"I am <em>not</em> your sister," Amilsandre griped.
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n shrugged dismissively. "Well, no, but 'second cousin
twice removed' sounds so impersonal, don't you think?"
</p>

<p>
Amilsandre seemed surprised by that.  Also, irritated, but it was hard
to distinguish given how much irritation she'd shown before.  "Once
removed, little cousin," she corrected with the lofty and dismissive
sniff of older siblings&mdash;er, cousins&mdash;everywhere.
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n grinned.  "Helllooo? Goddess of Secrets here, right?
Trust me.  Twice removed."  She hesitated.  "Well, or once,
depending."
</p>

<p>
Amilsandre eyed her for a moment, then started to look worried.
"Parallel?" she asked hopefully.
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n snickered.  "Sorry, cuz.  Cross."
</p>

<p>
Amilsandre made a face.  "Eeew."  She shot a sour glance at
Herr&uacute;n.  "Thanks <em>ever so</em> for sharing, brat."
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n stuck her tongue out at her older cousin before
sobering.  "Look, as a peace offering, how about I come by in a couple
months and tell you all about Arros?" she asked, eyeing her cousin
closely.  "I know all his favorite thi-i-ngs," she singsonged
temptingly.  "I bet he'd be just <em>captivated</em> by a lovely lady
who just <em>happened</em> to have an interest in what he's currently
studying...."
</p>

<p>
Amilsandre looked flustered; a bright crimson blush climbed up from
her neckline and charged on towards her ears.  "Well, I mean...um...he
seems awfully...<em>taken</em> with Mika..."  she said,
stumbling over her own words.
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw!" Herr&uacute;n said with a dismissive wave.  "That hussy?
Nah.  She's just messing with him.  She'll be moving on in a few
weeks."
</p>

<p>
"oh," said Amilsandre quietly, a faint expression of hope on her face.
</p>

<p>
"Great!  I'll be there no later than the solstice!" Herr&uacute;n
responded with a triumphant smile.
</p>

<p>
Amilsandre opened and closed her mouth a few times as though trying to
find something to say.  Finally, she just vanished.
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n dusted her hands off with a satisfied smile and turned
to us.  "Well, now that <em>she's</em> taken care of, where were we?
Oh, right.  Thanks for the resurrection.  Now, let's see, things you
need to know," she looked up at the sky for a moment, tapping her
finger on her chin thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Well, first off, Afi's going to grant you the audience and right now
he intends to let you say your piece before trying anything hostile,
so that's good."  She noticed our alarmed expressions and gave us a
disgusted glance.  "Oh, don't worry.  Dad was being paranoid; saying
Afi's name isn't going to attract Death's attention."  She shot Loki
an even more disgusted look.  "Honestly, Dad.  Talk about
paranoid&mdash;it's not like Death <em>cares</em> that much about
Boneboy that he's always tuned in on him."
</p>

<p>
Loki shrugged and spread his hands placatingly.  "How should I know,
sweetie?  And it's not paranoia since they really <em>are</em> out to
get me."
</p>

<p>
She snorted fondly.  "Yes, well, maybe if you'd stop distracting them
from checking on things they need to know about and stop trying to
resurrect long dead gods that make them all nervous, maybe they'd stop
trying to play Whack-a-Mole with your face."
</p>

<p>
He reared back with an overacted expression of injury.  "Moi? You say
these things to moi?  Ah, how sharper than a serpent's tooth&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," she interrupted, waving a hand dismissively.  "Ungrateful
daughter blah blah blah.  Ungrateful my divine keister, ya big goof.
It's not ungrateful if it's true."
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me?" Drifa asked uncertainly.  
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n glanced over at her.  "Ah!  It's
Ms-still-a-cleric-for-now!"
</p>

<p>
Drifa paled.  "'Still-a-cleric-for-now'?" she asked shakily.
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n nodded sympathetically.  "I'm sorry, that wasn't a very
tactful way for me to say it.  You defied her direct order and, worse,
you did it to resurrect someone she's always been afraid of.  I
distracted her as best I could so she'd leave instead of doing
anything while she was angry but...the next time she remembers you,
she's going to renounce you and strip you of your cleric levels."
</p>

<p>
Drifa staggered, her face going paper white. "What?" she gasped.
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n stepped close, slipping a supportive arm around her.
"I'm sorry, Mom, I wish&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Drifa twitched, turning out of the embrace to stare at Herr&uacute;n.
"Mom?!" she demanded warningly.
</p>

<p>
The Goddess of Secrets looked abashed.  "Well...um...kinda?  Dad
supplied the secrets, and you were the one who actually reified me,
so...."
</p>

<p>
Drifa just stared at her in shock, then abruptly sat down and put her
head in her hands.
</p>

<p>
"This is not happening," she moaned.  "I'm only three hundred and
sixty-eight, I am not <em>ready</em> to have a daughter.  Especially
not a goddess.  And I am <em>definitely</em> not ready to lose the
path that I've spent three and a half centuries following!"
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n, for all her Knowledge, seemed at a loss.  "Um...Mom?
What did you think was going to happen when you defied your goddess in
public, about a major issue?  I mean, I'm sorry but...."
</p>

<p>
"<em>Stop.  Talking.</em>" Drifa snarled, looking up with eyes
blazing.  "If I just lost my entire life, then make it worthwhile.
Tell us how we beat Afi and his boss."
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n made a waffling gesture with one hand.  "Weeeelllll,
it's not <em>quite</em> that simple.  See, I'm the Goddess of Secrets
and it's not really cool for me to just be telling them left and
right, even if&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You're grounded," Drifa said firmly.
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n blinked in shock.  "What?"
</p>

<p>
"I said, you're <em>grounded,</em>" Drifa snapped.  "I am your mother,
and you will not sass me, young lady."
</p>

<p>
"Buh..." said Herr&uacute;n, too gobsmacked to process.  "Ah..."  she
tried again.  Finally she stopped, took a breath, and said "Ok, that's
really not going to work.  I'm a grown woman and, oh yes,
a <em>goddess</em>.  I'm not going to be sent to my room like
a&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Drifa was on her feet and right up in Herr&uacute;n's face,
grabbing the lapels of her patchwork coat and yanking her down so they
were nose-to-nose.  "You don't get to have it both ways!  Either
I <em>am</em> your mother and I just threw over three centuries of
dedication away to birth you because that's a mother's <em>job</em>
and so you will do as I say, or I am <em>not</em> your mother and you
owe me for my sacrifice.  So <em>choose!</em>"
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n was leaning back, eyes wide in shock.  It should have
seemed funny&mdash;like a terrier barking at a mastiff&mdash;but it
really didn't.  Whatever else Drifa was, 'hella intimidating' was
definitely on the list.
</p>

<p>
"Uh...Dad?  A little help here?" Herr&uacute;n begged, glancing over
at Loki desperately.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Master High Priestess, you might want to stand down a bit," he
said soothingly.  "After all&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She whirled on him, keeping one hand tangled in Herr&uacute;n's collar
and pointing the other at him like a gun.  "Shut it!  You've been
playing us since day one!  You just tricked me into giving up my
entire life and becoming a <em>mother!</em> Which makes you...what?!
My husband?!  Just shut your godsdamned hole while I explain to our
daughter how it's going to be.  I'll get to you in a minute."
</p>

<p>
Loki rocked back, eyes going wide in his own shock.  After a minute he
blinked and his face split into a wide smile.  "Sorry, Herry-bug,
you're on your own for this one.  If there's one thing I've learned
over the millenia, it's 'never come between an angry woman and her
target.'  I'm just gonna shut my godsdamned hole and watch the
fireworks."  He plopped down onto a folding camp chair and started
snacking on his tub of popcorn, eyes riveted on the confrontation
between the priestess and the goddess.
</p>

<p>
Drifa turned back to Herr&uacute;n, releasing her collar with a push
that made the goddess stumble slightly.  Drifa followed after her,
poking her in the collarbone to emphasize each point.
</p>

<p>
"There are three million people in this
city"&mdash;<em>poke</em>&mdash;"and every single one of them
sacrificed part of their <em>souls</em> to help birth
you."&mdash;<em>poke</em>&mdash;"On top of that, I gave up my
entire <em>life</em> to make that ritual work.
Three"&mdash;<em>poke</em>&mdash;"hundred"&mdash;<em>poke</em>&mdash;"and
fifty"&mdash;<em>poke</em>&mdash;"<em>years</em> I have served the
Mother, and I threw it all away to let <em>you</em> come into this
world."&mdash;<em>poke</em>&mdash;"You <em>will</em> do as I tell you
and you <em>will not</em> give me any crap about it, do we understand
each other?  I won't mess with your goddessinghood but you
do <em>not</em> tell me that I just gave up my life and then give me
crap, do you understand me?!  You <em>will</em> help us.
You <em>will</em> give us whatever secrets or information we need to
survive and prosper without any grief or cryptic hints or any of that
utter crap that <em>he's</em> so fond of"&mdash;she pointed accusingly
at Loki&mdash;"understand?  Just simple, straightforward, and
helpful.  <em>Got it?!</em>"
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n had left 'taken aback' a few miles in her rearview, was
rolling through the town of 'alarmed' right now and if she looked up
ahead the city of 'scared' was visible on the horizon. "Ok!  Ok," she
said placatingly.  "Look, I literally <em>can't</em> just volunteer
everything.  It's against my core portfolio, as well as being counter
to Dad's base persona, and he's the major imprint that defined me."
She raised her hands to ward off Drifa's rage before the
soon-to-be-fallen priestess could tear another strip off her.  "I'll
do what I can, though.  My minor portfolio lets me be more open, so
I'll use that as much as possible to answer what questions I can as
directly as I can.  If I can't, then I'll give hints, and I can always
at least point you to sources.  Ok?"
</p>

<p>
Drifa snarled again, but reluctantly nodded.  "Fine.  Wait here and
don't interrupt."  She turned and stalked over to Loki who jumped up
(his popcorn and campchair vanishing) and looked around wildly for a
place to hide.
</p>

<p>
"Oh no you don't," she told him, grabbing on to the front of his
motley.  "You have been playing us since day one, haven't you?
Spill it!"
</p>

<p>
Loki looked over at Herr&uacute;n imploringly.  His daughter give him
a nasty smirk and lounged back with her camp chair and popcorn.
"Sorry, Dad," she said sweetly.  "If there's one thing you've taught
me, it's 'never come between an angry woman and her target.'  You're
on your own for this one."
</p>

<p>
Drifa gave him a shake to recapture his attention.  "<em>Spill</em>,
Trickster.  Why is it that Herr&uacute;n is your daughter?  We did the
sacrifices, not you.  Why did you even show up to us in the first
place?  You've been gaming us since we met you, I'm sure of that. What
was the game?!"
</p>

<p>
Very slowly and delicately, Loki reached up and tugged on Drifa's
hands where they were clenched in his collar.  She paused, then
released him and glared expectantly.  In response, Loki smoothed his
Victorian suit, brushed some nonexistent lint from his sleeve, and
settled into an armchair, sitting ramrod straight on the edge of it,
his hands balanced on the ebony cane that he stood upright between his
feet.
</p>

<p>
"It's true, I did play you.  But you have to admit, the game was
pretty good for you, too.  Right?" he asked, looking a question at me.
</p>

<p>
I stared back, eyes narrowed.  "What did you do?" I demanded. 
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said, puffing on his pipe until it was lit to his
satisfaction.  He leaned back and crossed his legs casually.  "It all
started about five years ago.  Death was really making
headway&mdash;Afi'd conquered most of the Underdark that underlies
this continent, and was spreading outwards from there.  He had taken
over pretty much all of the Union within days of his initial attack;
there were some survivors, but nothing combat effective.  Death had
been getting in Afi's way about as much as it's possible to do, and
yet Afi was still crushing all opposition.  We&mdash;that is, the
gods&mdash;aren't allowed to forcibly convert people, but he gave Afi
the task of increasing his worshippers, so Afi started a pogrom
against any undead who didn't worship Death.  Pretty soon, all of the
minor undead had switched their faith, as well as most of the liches
and some of the Lich Kings.  Death's power was growing out of control,
and then it got even worse once Afi had his little 'hey, I can make a
spell engine that creates humans who can then be immediately converted
into undead who can then be forced to become worshippers of my god'
brainstorm.  That's not just brushing the edges of the 'no creating
worshippers' rule, it's dancing the fandango on it, so Afi had to be a
bit restrained about it or the Overgods would step on him and Death
both, but it was still a river of new worshippers every day that we
couldn't realistically match."
</p>

<p>
He sighed, looking genuinely tired.  "Some of the other gods were
banding together to fight him, but they kept squabbling among
themselves, and that was enough to keep them from shutting Afi and his
boss down.
</p>

<p>
"I could see what was happening, of course," he said with a grimace.
"Afi was engineering the squabbles, with Death covering him from being
directly observed.  He was really sneaky about it...there was nothing
that could easily be traced back to him, but I could see it
happening&mdash;God of Tricks, right?"  He sighed again.  "That's the
problem though&mdash;most of the others won't believe me if I say that
water is wet, let alone that a mere lich was messing with their heads
and turning them against each other."
</p>

<p>
Just for a moment, his face became unguarded as he was lost in his
thoughts.  I saw a truly cavernous degree of sadness and loneliness
there...and then, in a blink, it vanished as Loki came back to
himself.  "You guys needed some help.  Some <em>serious</em> help.
I'm a god, but I'm a lesser god.  Death is one of the greatest of the
greater gods, and rapidly becoming <em>the</em> greatest.  If he decided
to squash me, I'd be squashed.  I couldn't fight him directly, but I
could get you some help."
</p>

<p>
He waved the pipe towards Herr&uacute;n with a nod of acknowledgement.
"She's the one god that everyone else has always been afraid of.  You
can't plot against her; if you keep your plans secret, she knows them.
If you make your plans public knowledge, she knows them.  Last time
around, it took an alliance between almost all of the greater gods to
take her out, and even then she had a temple that was hidden from them
that meant she still had a foothold here&mdash;she wasn't quite dead."
</p>

<p>
He turned to face me.  "Remember when Albrecht told you that 'one of
his sages had found a reference to Herr&uacute;n in the archives'?
Did you ever stop and wonder how it was that a group of refugees had a
research library with them?"
</p>

<p>
"Huh," I said, startled.  No, it really hadn't occurred to me.  I
turned to Albrecht for an explanation.
</p>

<p>
"When we were on the move, we didn't have anything more than our
spellbooks," he said with a frown.  "After we founded Gr&#491;fhamr I
sent out scouts to find anything written they could, especially spell
research materials."
</p>

<p>
"Mm-hmm," Loki said smugly.  "How'd that work out for you?"
</p>

<p>
"Not well, actually," Albrecht said slowly.  "Afi had been doing the
same thing, but for longer.  Every place we checked was
empty&mdash;everything was gone and replaced with blank books filled
with Explosive Runes.  Most of those places actually had self-destruct
traps set...open the bookcase, the whole mountain comes down on you."
</p>

<p>
He paused to think; I could see his jaw clench in anger as he worked
through it.  "We finally found a branch repository of the Academy
library, out in an underground base dug under the desert&mdash;it
guaranteed stable temperatures and no moisture, good conditions for
preserving books.  We stripped that place bare, brought it all back
here, and I set people to hunting through it."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht turned to Loki accusingly.  "You planted those books, didn't
you?  You wanted us to find them."
</p>

<p>
Loki buffed his nails, looking insufferably smug.  "I have been known
to write a tome or two in my time, 'tis true.  So, after I led you to
those books and pointed your sages at the right passage&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ahem," Herr&uacute;n said, arching an eyebrow at her father.  "Don't
listen to him.  He found a repository that contained references to me
and he hid it from Afi's reapers, but you found it on your own and
your sages found the reference to me.  He hid a bunch of book
repositories from Afi, actually&mdash;all the ones that had
information about me.  That just happened to be the one you found."
</p>

<p>
Loki gave her a sour glare.  "You couldn't let your old man have
a <em>little</em> credit?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
She shrugged unrepentantly.  "Sorry, Dad.  You heard what Mom
said&mdash;I need to be open and straightforward as much as possible.
Besides, I think I have every right to be a little pissed about this."
</p>

<p>
"What?" Loki demanded, aghast.  "I arranged things so that you could
be re-reified!  How can you be pissed about that?!"  He grumbled
something under his breath about ungrateful daughters that I couldn't
quite make out.
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n snorted.  "Yeah, but you arranged to have me fully
undone, first, remember?  You were the one who told Jake to blow up my
temple."
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Loki looked uncomfortable.  "Well, let's not quibble about
little details, right?" he asked with a friendly smile.  "After all,
isn't the important thing that we're all here, together?  As a
family?"
</p>

<p>
"Yeah, what was up with that temple-exploding thing?" I demanded of
Herr&uacute;n.  "If he wanted you brought back, why not just have us
do the ritual in your temple?  Surely that would have been faster and
easier."
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n glanced at Loki; her smile was complex.  There was part
fondness, part irritation, and part...admiration, maybe?  
</p>

<p>
"Yep, it would have been," she told us.  "The remnant of my prior self
was still floating around; you could have just pulled it back, filled
it with new strength, and boom&mdash;I'd be back, just the way I was.
Only would have taken a few hours, if you'd done it in the heart of my
temple.  He didn't want the old me coming back," she said.  "The old
me was somber, secretive, a loner.  He wanted someone more...open to
the world, more loyal to family.  That meant he needed something more
than just a reintegration ritual; he needed a full reification.  And
to do <em>that,</em> he needed all of my anchors destroyed so that I
would be fully dissolved.  That way, you could do a reification ritual
to recreate me with a new persona.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," she said, smiling sardonically at her father, "he wasn't
about to take a chance on what my new persona would be like, or how it
would feel about <em>him.</em>  Nope, he didn't want a fair game, he
wanted a rigged bet.  When he saw the ritual that you were
doing&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<strong>Ahem,</strong>" Loki said pointedly.  "I can tell my own
story, thankyouverymuch."  He turned to us.  "Anyway, I set things up
so that you would do <em>a</em> reification ritual, figuring that I
could use it somehow.  Once I saw how yours worked, I knew the books
were the way to go.  I couldn't make my own sacrifices, of
course&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Wait, what?" I interrupted.  "Yes you did.  I saw you sacrifice
something."
</p>

<p>
Loki sighed in exasperation.  An altar appeared next to him, an exact
duplicate of all the others except that it wavered and flickered,
clearly an illusion.  "Herr&uacute;n, Lady of Secrets, take my secret
unto thee!" he cried without getting up from his sideways lounging in
his armchar.  He gestured as though tossing something into the flames;
they roared up ten, twenty, thirty feet, flaring in a silver so pure
that it bathed the entire ravine in artificial moonlight for six long
seconds.  The altar and the fire disappeared.
</p>

<p>
"<em>Trickster God,</em> Jake, Trickster God," he reminded me.  "Only
mortals can sacrifice to reify a god; other gods can't."  He paused,
looking insufferably smug.  "Of course, there's nothing stopping a
mortal from sacrificing someone <em>else's</em> knowledge and secrets,
if that person is willing to allow it.  Both parties just have to know
that that's what's happening and agree to do it.  That rule is
intended for situations where a mortal can't physically get to the
altar to make the sacrifice, but it doesn't say anything about
'another mortal,' just 'another person.'"
</p>

<p>
I frowned.  "Hang on, we didn't agree to sacrifice your secrets.  You
gave that library to <em>us;</em> it should have been our secrets to
sacrifice."
</p>

<p>
Isaac groaned.  "No, he didn't," he said disgustedly.  "Remember, when
you asked him what the library was, he said 'All of <em>my</em>
juiciest info, laid out for your perusal.'  He never said he gave it
to you."
</p>

<p>
Allison was laughing so hard that, had she had feet, she would have
fallen off of them.  "Oh Fire!" she gasped.  "Jake&mdash;the look on
your face right now!"  Whatever she was trying to say after that
dissolved under a horde of giggles.
</p>

<p>
"But...those books contained all these important things," I said,
somewhat desperately.  "Like, the nature of the gods and such.
Shouldn't you have ended up lobotomized when they were all
sacrificed?"
</p>

<p>
Loki smiled wickedly.  "Well, they <em>did</em> contain that, when I
first gave them to you.  They had to, because I had to answer your
question completely and blah blah blah.  But they were <em>my</em>
secrets, not yours, which meant that I could change them around freely
so, when I 'said goodbye' to the books, I actually swapped out their
contents for things I was willing to give up."  He flashed me an
insufferably cocky grin.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, you had been told that the secrets were mine," he
continued.  "So me changing the contents of the books didn't impact
our agreement for you to sacrifice them.  Oh, and don't forget that it
was <em>your</em> idea to sacrifice them&mdash;I even tried to argue
you out of it, remember?  By the way, my dear," he said, glancing over
at Drifa.  "You are the best haggler it's been my displeasure to
encounter for two centuries.  I really thought I was going to manage
to get rid of all those stupid questions."
</p>

<p>
"So, let me make sure I understand this," Albrecht said.  "You set us
up to find the books that contained the information about
Herr&uacute;n.  You had Jake destroy her temple so that she could be
brought back with a new personality.  You created the library with the
hope that we would sacrifice it, deliberately making it illegible so
that we wouldn't have anything better to do with it.  Then, when we
decided to actually <em>do</em> the sacrifice that you wanted us to
do, you made us pay for the privilege by giving up the questions that
we'd already bargained for.  Then you replaced all the information in
the books with other information, so we weren't even sacrificing what
we thought we were sacrificing.  You made sure that there was so much
information in the books that it completely dominated the sacrifices
from all other sources, meaning that Herr&uacute;n was largely based
off of you.  Is that it?  Is there any <em>other</em> way that you've
manipulated us?"
</p>

<p>
Loki lounged back in his inflatable rubber-ducky lifering, paddling
his feet in the kiddy pool, and sipped a Mai Tai.  "Hmmmmmmm," he said
thoughtfully, staring at the night sky above us.  "Other ways I've
manipulated you...hmmmm."  He rocked a hand in a so-so gesture.  "It
depends on your definition of 'manipulated,' I guess...."
</p>

<p>
Drifa pivoted to face Herr&uacute;n, arms folded under a thunderous
expression.
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n waved from where she was sprawled in her beach lounger,
basking in the rays of a miniature sun.  "Hey, don't look at me, Mom!
This is between the two of you."  She slurped at her drink&mdash;some
frou-frou thing with an umbrella&mdash;and adjusted her bikini strap.
At some point, when I wasn't paying attention (because I was too busy
being gobsmacked by how thoroughly outplayed I'd been), she had
changed.  The tall, horse-faced woman with the gray hair was gone,
replaced by a redheaded sixteen year old with big sunglasses and long
hair that she wore in a ponytail.  The bikini was scanty enough to
give me multiple kinds of uncomfortableness: attractive woman (ding!),
underage (ding!), immortal goddess who could crush my head like a
grape (double ding!).
</p>

<p>
"Don't you duck the question," Drifa told her firmly.  "And make some
chairs for the rest of us; it's rude to keep us all standing.  Also,
put some clothes on."
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n wore the put-upon face of all teenage daughters
everywhere, but her bikini expanded out into a one-piece and chairs
appeared in a circle, one behind each of us.  They varied in size and
type to suit the person; mine was a slingseat&mdash;basically a
half-hammock that was suspended from thin air.  Thomas had a
high-backed wooden chair that would be easy to get out of quickly.
Isaac and Reynard had soft armchairs, and so on.  From the slightly
different heights, it was clear that each chair had been perfectly
tailored to its recipient's dimensions.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you dear, this is very nice," Drifa said warmly, sinking back
into her loveseat and curling her feet up.  Herr&uacute;n tried to
hide it, but she looked pleased at the praise.  "Now, you were going
to tell us about how your father has been manipulating us?"  The
question was polite, interested, and backed up with a hint of steel.
I felt a little sorry for Herr&uacute;n; having a warrior priestess
for a parent couldn't possibly be easy for anyone, especially a
divinity.
</p>

<p>
"Herry-bug, I don't think you need to be part of this," Loki told her,
just a hint of nervousness in his voice.  "Why don't you head off to
your home plane, and we can talk later?"
</p>

<p>
"You stay right there," Drifa told her forbodingly.  "And you," she
said, pinning Loki with a killer stare.  "Answer the question.  What
else have you done to manipulate us?"
</p>

<p>
Loki smiled affably, spreading his arms in friendly reassurance.
"Manipulate?  Me?  Never!  I make plans, sure...maybe think about
contingencies...do a few deals here and there, sure.  But manipulate?
Never!  I love you guys."
</p>

<p>
"Uh-huh," Drifa said doubtfully.  She looked back at Herr&uacute;n.
"Well?" she demanded.
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n paused, glancing between her parents.  "Well...nothing,
really.  I mean, he had a bunch of plans in place, just in case you
didn't find the library, or didn't decide to sacrifice the books, or
Afi found you all and killed you before you could do the ritual...that
kind of thing."
</p>

<p>
"Now that's an interesting question," Thomas said, in a tone that made
it perfectly clear that he knew what the answer would be.
"How <em>exactly</em> did Afi manage to find Gr&#491;fhamr, slip one
of his Ice Assassins inside, scry on us, and have his free Ice
Assassins start taking over the ritual...and yet he never showed up to
kill us all?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, yes, that..." Loki said.  "Well...it's possible that Afi was
never actually scrying on you and I just said that."
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n snorted.  "Of course he wasn't scrying on you.  That
Weirdstone that you use to block teleportation also blocks scrying."
</p>

<p>
"What?" said Albrecht in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"What?" demanded Unn in surprise.
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n giggled.  "Yeah.  When it's in use, no teleportation
effects can manifest within six miles of the stone, and neither can
astral travel, ethereal travel, or scrying spells.  You can teleport
or scry <em>out</em>&mdash;the effect just can't target anywhere
within six miles of the stone.  You didn't know that?"
</p>

<p>
Albrecht and Unn looked at each other in chagrin.  They remained oddly
silent.
</p>

<p>
"Seriously?" I demanded.  "You didn't know that?  We've spent all this
effort walking around the city instead of sitting in a comfortable war
room with a table where we could put maps and food.  We set up
production lines for anti-scrying spells to cover this area.  All
that, and you didn't realize that your protective little geegaw did
all that already?"
</p>

<p>
Silence.
</p>

<p>
"In our defense, Weirdstones are extremely uncommon," Unn offered.
</p>

<p>
"Snorri's is the only one I was aware of," Albrecht added.  
</p>

<p>
"Yeah well, Dad had good intentions," Herr&uacute;n put in.  "A god's
remote sensing power can scry through any mortal protection; if Death
had been alerted to where you were, he could have scryed you.  Moving
quickly through different planes is about the only defense you could
mount against that."
</p>

<p>
I frowned.  "But, hang on.  Gods are alerted when any event related to
their portfolio happens.  Death should have been aware every time
someone died, and then been able to scry in on them.  When we brought
Isaac and Reynard back, two guys died; shouldn't he have been aware of
that, and therefore able to scry on us?"
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n hesitated, glancing at Loki.  He looked back at her
nervously; the two were pretty much the archetype of 'what lie do we
tell to get out of this?'  The stalemate was finally broken when Drifa
cleared her throat loudly.
</p>

<p>
"Well..." Herr&uacute;n began.  "It's...possible that some of the
other gods have been blocking Death's sight as much as
possible...which pretty much means 'from anywhere that isn't directly
around one of his temples or major worshippers or such.'"
</p>

<p>
There was silence as we all digested that.
</p>

<p>
"So, you're saying that Death can't see us at all?" Albrecht asked
carefully.
</p>

<p>
"Weellll...not exactly," said Herr&uacute;n, tipping her head in
thought.  "If someone dies, he knows about it and where it is.
Fortunately, anyone dying inside Gr&#491;fhamr is on a different
plane, and there's no way to trace the connection to any of
the <em>other</em> planes that make up Gr&#491;fhamr, or back to the
Prime Material, without being able to directly view the location.  And
if you say his name, or if you're standing in one of his temples, or
next to one of his major worshippers, or something like that...then he
could see you.  Otherwise, nope."
</p>

<p>
Again, there was silence as we all digested that.
</p>

<p>
"So, what you're saying," Allison asked delightedly.  "Is that these
chumps have been jogging all over the city, and there was no need?
And that <em>he</em>"&mdash;she extended a flickering tongue of flame
towards Loki&mdash;"had them do it...just to mess with them?"
</p>

<p>
All eyes turned to Loki.  He had the grace to look abashed...and then
completely lost it and cracked up.  "Yeah, pretty much.  Hey,
Trickster God, right? C'mon, it's hilarious."
</p>

<p>
There was a chorus of sour faces and grumbles from the mortals in the
circle, punctuated by Allison's delighted snickering.
</p>

<p>
"Going back to an earlier question," Reynard asked in that
can-we-please-change-the-subject tone that you get when you're trying
to get someone to stop laughing at you.  "If no scrying is possible,
how exactly did Afi's Ice Assassins find us so that they could try to
take over the ritual?"
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n gave Loki a significant look that clearly said 'You want
to take this one?'  He cleared his throat before saying, "It's
possible that W wawa wawa wawa waw wawaw wa waw waw wawa wawaw wawa
wawawawaw wa wa."
</p>

<p>
"What?" I asked, confused as to why Loki suddenly sounded like one of
the adults from the Peanuts cartoons.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, for Elysium's sake," Herr&uacute;n grumbled, making a throwing
gesture at me.  Something hit me in the forehead, knocking my head
back.  I suddenly remembered Loki saying <em>It's possible that I told
them what was going on and how they could take advantage of it.</em>
For a moment this seemed strange and unnatural, and then my thinking
shifted and the pieces clicked back together&mdash;that's right, Loki
had been playing both sides, hadn't he?  He wasn't really helping us,
he was just preventing Neklos from taking over the world.
</p>

<p>
A disgruntled sigh went around the circle after Loki's revelation.
</p>

<p>
"Fine," Thomas said eventually.  "Whatever.  Let's move on to
tomorrow&mdash;we need to prepare for this audience with Afi.  Lady
Herr&uacute;n, it would be helpful if you could stay hidden until we
need you, perhaps in&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Herr&uacute;n sat up suddenly and held up a hand to stop him, giving
him a serious look over the rims of her John Lennon shades.  "Hang on
there, bucko.  No way am I going with you tomorrow.  If Death sees me,
all bets are off.  He'd shred me instantly, kill all of you, and then
go have toast.  Nuh-uh, I'm staying home.  I am Advisory Girl, not
Storm-the-Barricades-Woman. I leave that to you big strong men types."
She glanced quickly at Drifa to her left.  "And women, of course."
She sat back and took a long pull on her chocolate milkshake,
apparently satisfied that the conversation was over.
</p>

<p>
Things were quiet for a moment as the same thought went through all
our heads: <em>Lovely.  The goddess that we spent so much effort
resurrecting so she would help us against Neklos, won't help us
against Neklos...who we are going to be face-to-face with tomorrow.
Lovely.</em>
</p>

<em><strong>Rules Note:</strong> There's a bit of weirdness with how
Gr&#491;fhamr and the Weirdstone interact: in general, magical effects
don't cross planar boundaries and, as has been remarked, each of the
Portable Holes that make up Gr&#491;fhamr is technically a separate
plane.  If the Weirdstone is outside the city then technically it
would cover the area <strong>around</strong> the city, but its effect
wouldn't reach into the city itself, meaning that a Scry Location
could in fact look into the city.  On the other hand, if the
Weirdstone were inside the city, it wouldn't affect more than one
Portable Hole so the same weakness to Scry Location would apply.
</p>

<p>
<em>Portable Holes are a bit unusual, though.  Other interplanar
spells (e.g. Mage's Magnificent Mansion and Gate) create magical
portals that leads to another plane.  Portable Holes are
simply...holes.  Actual, physical holes.  After thinking about it for
a while, I decided that area effects would cross the boundary but
non-AoE effects would not.  So, for example, if you are standing just
outside Gr&#491;fhamr and you drop a Fireball right in front of the
door, the fire will spread into the city.  On the other hand, if you
try to make the Fireball appear <strong>inside</strong> the city while
you are <strong>outside</strong>, then the spell will fail.  Ditto for
trying to cast a Magic Missile through the door.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>To balance this out, I decided that large scale AoE effect
(especially the Weirdstone) would not emanate from inside
Gr&#491;fhamr normally.  The inside of the city is physically
connected to the outside, but its insides do not have a well-defined
location in reference to the outside.  So, if the Weirdstone were
inside the city then it would shield the entire city and a line
emanating straight out from the door.  If it's outside the city, then
it will cover its normal six mile radius, including the city.
</p>

<p>
<em>In a nutshell: since the Weirdstone is outside the city its effect
covers the normal area and extends into the city even though that
technically requires crossing planar boundaries.

<em>The blurb for "One Hot Night" is:</em>
</p>
<p>
"In a society without death, Ingfred is 20 years old and has no
prospects. All the good jobs are filled by undying masters of their
craft, and it's hard to be taken seriously when you are, compared to
everyone around you, an infant.  Fortunately, he has a solution:
undergo an illegal transformation and sell the memory to The
Experiental Herald for a ridiculous sum.
</p>

<p>
There's two problems: how can Ingfred convince a powerful wizard to
risk his mage license and his freedom to help with such a crazy plan?
And, once that's done...how will Ingfred deal with the law?"
