<p>
I was taken aback.  Putting on a sweatband was going to boost my
braininess?  I didn't even know how to react to that.  What should I
say in response, 'cool'?  Or maybe 'why didn't you give me that
sooner?'  Assuming it actually worked; if such things existed, why
weren't they as common as dirt?  Was there anyone
who <em>wouldn't</em> benefit from getting extra brains jammed into
their noggin?
</p>

<p>
Silence fell as we all withdrew into our thoughts.  I spent the time
just trying to get organized, mentally speaking.  Finally, Franklin
returned with a spiral-shaped jade earring in hand.  Wordlessly, he
passed it to Thomas and took his original seat.
</p>

<p>
"That doesn't look like a headband to me," I pointed out dubiously.
</p>

<p>
Ryan, one of the Guardsmen who hadn't spoken yet, chimed in. "Headband
is just the default form, M'Lord.  There's lots of variations;
hairclips, bobby pins, hair spikes, chokers, phylacteries.  Basically
anything that can be worn on or near the head."
</p>

<p>
I shrugged.  "Small problem; I don't have pierced ears."
</p>

<p>
Thomas went from his chair to standing beside me before I could blink.
I was just starting to turn to ask him what he was doing when he
grabbed me by the ear and stabbed the sharpened tip of the earring
through my lobe.
</p>

<p>
"Ow, what do you think you're&mdash;" I cut off as a sudden hammerblow
to my brain shut me down, my mind cutting off all I/O ports in order
to focus its full effort on surviving what was happening inside my
skull.  In the span of a second I felt my awareness expand, unfolding
like the blooming of a complex origami rose.  My memories
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
smashed
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  into me
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  like a
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp  tidal
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;  wave
</p>

<p>
<em>...goodbye keep waving until we're out of sight what a wonderful
Christmas I love that house it's so warm and cozy and beautful and
everything is so tasteful...</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>...full of the taste of Thanksgiving: creamed spinach and pearled
onions and squash and cranberry sauce with the ridges they have the
fresh stuff but I like the ridges and the turkey is a bit too dry and
oh no I'm stuck next to Uncle Joe god he's boring oh well I'll
manage... </em>
</p>

<p>
<em>...a team of programmers my job to shield them from management so
they can actually get work done and things are great with Bill but not
so much with Anita even though she's got skills she's prickly and I
try to smooth things over... </em>
</p>

<p>
<em>...head compartments by me are full darnit I'll have to put my
bag four seats back and that means waiting forever to get off the
plane oh well whinging about it isn't helpful...</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>...to everyone, that's just who she is, all the time Nellie is
always helping someone but this isn't her dream job her dream job was
to be a counselor although she's amazing where she works it's her
dream but she doesn't want to do a Ph.D. and I can't blame her...</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>...for any of it because I took her for granted and it's my own
stupid fault...</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>...lines in California are everywhere more of them than you can
shake a stick at and it's kinda crazy living here and it's true it's
like a bowl of granola lots of nuts and flakes....</em>
</p>

<p>
I couldn't stop the wave, it was too powerful.  Instead I slid up the
face, got on top of it, and surfed on the crest.  All I could do was
keep my head out of the flood so I didn't drown under the pressure.
</p>

<p>
Slowly, ever so slowly, I got it under control.  I reduced the tidal
wave to a heavy surf, to a low wave, to a ripple, and finally made the
surface calm.  I spent some unknown timeless time storing the memories
away, filing them in their proper place.  Everything slotted into my
mind like elegant sculptures on the pedestals of a giant gallery; I
took care to note exactly where each one was so I could find it again
when I wanted it.
</p>

<p>
A few moments later I took a deep breath, let it out in a whoosh, and
opened my eyes.  "Well that's...different."  It was incredible
understatement.  This was the most amazing thing I'd ever experienced.
Have you ever been completely exhausted and ravenously hungry at the
same time, so drained that your brain seems to be drowning in sludge
and you can hardly form a coherent thought?  This was exactly unlike
that.  My thoughts were blinking back and forth at the speed of light,
sliding across my mind like speed skaters on a straightaway.
</p>

<p>
Tears were running down my face from the beauty of it.  I've always
been a smart guy, and I defined myself by my mind.  To me, this boost
was like a professional weightlifter suddenly being able to benchpress
a bus.  I spent an entire minute just standing there, exploring my own
mental processes.
</p>

<p>
Here were my memories, perfectly laid out, accessible, and
crossindexed for the first time in my life.  With just a thought I
could relive the experience of appearing in the Work Room, talking
with Albrecht, eating cheese and fruit in the sitting room, meeting
Allison, meeting the Conclave, my various sessions with Duncan...every
moment clear, sharp.  Here were my cognitive functions, sharp and
facile; I spent a few moments determining that the prime factors of
10,791 were 3, 3, 11, and 109.  It was amazing.
</p>

<p>
Finally I got it under control and turned to my benefactor.  "Thank
you, Franklin.  This is the best thing that's ever happened to me."  I
got up and paced into the bathroom to look in the mirror.  After a
moment I returned, a goofy grin plastered across my face.  "Plus, I
look totally badass with this ring in my ear."  Franklin smiled back,
ducking his head slightly in embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
A shiny thought occurred to me, and my face lit up.  "Hey, can I get
another&mdash;" Halfway through the obvious question my newly-enhanced
mind flipped the Brainopedia open to the relevant page and slapped a
pointer down on the key rule: Thou shalt not stack bonuses of the same
type.  Fooey.  No four-rings-per-ear for me, I guess.
</p>

<p>
"Did it help?  Do you see a solution?"  Thomas was trying to be his
normal self, calm and stoic, but I could hear the concern underlying
it.
</p>

<p>
"Give me a minute, I need to think."  I closed my eyes again and
started spinning the situation around in my brand new Brain 2.0
thingy.  Brain 2: The Quickening (no, wait, that was a terrible
movie). The Eternal Sunshine of the Superfast Mind. (No, strike that.
Losing memories is with the bad, as I ought to know.)  Brain Wars: A
New Hope. (Ooh, I liked that one!  Let's go with that.  Or maybe just
the abbreviation, BW:ANH.  No, that was awful, it would be pronounced
bwan...hm, actually that sounded like ObiWan, so maybe it wasn't so
bad.  Yep, Bwan it was.)
</p>

<p>
With an effort I yanked my skittering thoughts out of their
tangent-tangle and back onto the subject.  Movie reference wordplay:
good.  Saving millions of lives, including my own: better.
</p>

<p>
<em>~Point one: we are totally outgunned, outnumbered, and apparently
the enemy can resurrect their troops stupid fast.  As long as they can
bring them back that quickly it doesn't matter how many we kill.~</em>
</p>

<p>
I marked that thought-node and threw out threads to nearby gridpoints
in thoughtspace: how were they doing it?  How <em>fast</em> could they
do it&mdash;was the stated rate of five thousand in two days
sustainable?  Was it even real?  I left all those nodes stubbed in and
went back to the main strand of the thoughtweb I was building.
</p>

<p>
The key point was the resurrections.  Take that out of play and we
could find a way to win the war.  With the enemy being resurrected
faster than Congress voting themselves a pay raise, it didn't really
matter what we did.  How were they doing it?  Magic item?  Massive
number of casters?  Divine favor?
</p>

<p>
<em>~Unlikely to be casters; the sheer number of high level
spellcasters required to do what Albrecht claimed is totally
impractical.~</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>~Hm.  Reverse, revise.  Number of casters not impractical, if
Albrecht truthful throughout. (Guesstimate of prior probability...55%.
Need evidence to adjust that.  Critical importance.)  Albrecht is a
general, not a frontline battlewizard, so he is likely lower level
than most frontliners.  Despite that, he used a Wish to transport
himself and all of his team.  In order to do that, he must have been
at least 17th level.  If he was telling the truth about being four
hundred years old (prior: 98% if resurrection ability is real, 1%
otherwise), then he's had plenty of time to get levels in basically
everything.~</em>
</p>

<p>
The keystone of everything was the truth of his statements about
Anundj&aring;.  If they really had a billion people (<em>~economically
and agriculturally trivial under doofus monetary system, challenging
on political front...prior: 99% given four hundred year age, 5%
otherwise~</em>), and they really were in a constant state of war,
then they would generate lots of Experience Points for all frontline
soldiers.  That meant lots of high level citizens, many of them
casters (since casters were more effective at battlefield control and
straight blasting than sword-slingers), which made the effective
immortality and mass resurrection much more practical.
</p>

<p>
<em>~For non-frontliners, they could capture and farm undead for XP.
Captures would be especially easy if the numbers of undead are as high
as stated.  Prior on undead being that common: six nines, given
exponential increase abilities.  (Hm.  Technically not exponential;
movement rate and prey density would restrict it to polynomial
growth.)~</em> I had a feeling I would want to revist that thoughtnode
in the future, so I mentally tagged it for easy reference.  I
envisioned an actual manilla tag, tied to the node with red string,
with words written on the tag in big black marker: 'mathematical
analysis of bio-consumptive endeavors of life-challenged individuals.'
After a moment's thought I decided that was too long, so I crossed it
out and wrote 'Fred.'  Simpler, easier to remember.  Much better.
</p>

<p>
Assume that a billion was accurate for their population.  What was the
Fermi estimate for their number of high level casters?
</p>

<p>
<em>~Thirty percent under arms is three hundred million.  Perhaps two
hundred million are actual combat soldiers. (Assumption: magic and
broken economics provide a tooth-to-tail ratio of 2:1, about the same
as 21st century American military; enormously better than any medieval
army.)  Casters, especially arcane casters, are major force
multipliers so they likely represent a significant fraction of the
armed forces...perhaps 60%?  That makes one hundred twenty million
casters total.  XP is easily acquired in battle, but attrition also
happens, so casters will skew to midlevel...wait, with mass
resurrection, is there attrition?  Yes, because attrition will mean
transformation into undead, and resurrection won't recover the person
until that particular undead is captured or destroyed.~</em></p>

<p>
Ok, with my assumptions set, what was my final Fermi
calculation? <em>~Maybe about 10% levels 1-5, 50% levels 6-12, 30%
levels 13-16, 10% levels 17+?  Call it twelve million high level
casters; assume 70% are arcane casters as there tend to be more
generally brainy people than people with religious calling.  Final
estimate: 8.4 million Archmage-level arcane casters and 3.6 million
divine casters capable of True Resurrection.  Difficulty of casting
five thousand True Resurrections in a day, essentially nil.~</em>
</p>

<p>
I took a full twenty seconds to ponder the appropriate word to
describe our chances given that we were facing eight and a half
million enemy Archmagi&mdash;or, in other terms, roughly one Archmage
for every three Flobovians. What was the proper word...doomed?  A bit
too formal and ponderous to be really satisfactory for inclusion in a
curse-filled rant. Also lacking in flow with that leading 'd' stop.
Screwed? A tad vulgar, and the sibilant could be difficult to manage
in an all-up, red-faced, rabid expostulation.  Hosed?  Ah, there we
go! A nice touch of informality, profanity-ly satisfying but not
vulgar, and the 'h' sound flowed smoothly with preceding words.
</p>

<p>
Yes, perfect: we were hosed.  Utterly and totally hosed.  The
canonical example of hosed.  Next to the word 'hosed' in the
dictionary was a definition saying 'hosed: see Flobovia'.  Hosed
beyond all previously conceivable levels of hosedness.  Yep,
definitely hosed.
</p>

<p>
I spent a long moment admiring the literary structure of my hosedness
peroration, then shook it off. Enough whinging, back to problem
solving.
</p>

<p>
<em>~It's not necessarily true, though.  Albrecht could have been
lying about everything; this might be the extent of what the Deorsi
can field against us.  And if their resurrections are happening at
all, it could be that they're done with an item, not millions of
casters.  Anyway, assume we can find a way to kill them permanently.
Even so, we're still outnumbered five to one until we can mobilize the
commoners and equip them with cannon.  Also, the Deorsi can teleport
their entire army right into our cities.  If we could bring them to
battle when and where we want, could we actually win that fight?
We're outmatched physically and magically, so we'd need something
clever.  Something that uses magic to work physics in a weird way,
like with the orbital strikes.  Something that can be deployed easily
and quickly, and affects a large area...oh.  Yeah.  That'll do
nicely.~</em>
</p>

<p>
My eyes popped open and I looked around the room.  "Two things: first
off, I know part of the answer on how to win battles with the Deorsi,
assuming that we can fight them somewhere outside our cities.  Second
and more importantly, the Archmagi did not include magic items in my
Brainopedia, because I wasn't aware of the Headbands.  The next time I
see them, remind me to smack them upside the head for that.
Seriously, shouldn't that be like #1 on the Evil Interdimensional
Kidnappers List?  Suze, when we're done here, get me a rundown on all
known magic items ASAP, ok?"
</p>

<p>
She nodded mutely, her eyes big with that nervous look I had seen
before.
</p>

<p>
That thought dealt with, I drew myself up dramatically.  "Gentlemen
and ladies," I pronounced firmly, beginning the rousing speech I had
mentally prepared four seconds previously.  I paused for effect,
pivoting slowly to survey my audience.  Finding them all properly
rapt, I nodded with overblown drama; I was ready to elucidate my
cogitations with great exactitude, and was gratified at their
attentiveness.  <em>~I really need to lay off the nine dollar
words,~</em> I muttered mentally to myself, also admiring the
alliteration.
</p>

<p>
I shook my head, trying to snap out of the self-analyzing metaloop I
was whizzing around in.  <em>~No, seriously, cut it out, Jake,~</em> I
told myself firmly.  <em>~I mean yes, more brains, calloo callay, but
now you're just showing off.  And showing off to yourself at that,
which is serious "Welcome to Loserville, population: you"
territory.~</em>
</p>

<p>
Despite the self-castigation I couldn't bring myself to stop (case in
point: 'castigation'?  Really?  Hadn't Mr Strunk, my seventh grade
English teacher, pounded the rule of "never use a long word where a
diminutive one will fit" into me?)  I snickered to myself.  This brain
enhancement totally rocked, but it did seem to get away from me
occasionally.
</p>

<p>
Ryan coughed delicately and I snapped out of my mental ramble.
"Right, where was I?...Ah, right.  If we can get the Deorsi to come to
us away from our cities, we can lay a serious smackdown on them.  I
mean, a smiting of truly biblical proportions.  Om nom nom, eat them
up and spit them out."
</p>

<p>
Uncertain smiles went around the room, including a rather timorous one
from Suze.  
</p>

<p>
"Ok, in seriousness.  The basic situation hasn't changed.  They still
outpower us and outnumber us, but now, apparently, if you kill them
they bounce back up faster than weebles.  The cannon are a great force
multiplier, and I have an idea for something else that's even better,
but we need a way to actually bring them to battle when and where we
want.  More importantly, we need to find out how they're doing all
those resurrections.  We have to find the best thief&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Rogue, M'Lord," Thomas cut in.
</p>

<p>
The interruption broke my momentum and I stumbled a bit before I could
shift tracks.  "What?"
</p>

<p>
"They're called rogues, M'Lord, not thieves," declared Thomas.
</p>

<p>
"Lord God, even Bobville has political correctness.  In <em>my</em>
day, they were called thieves.  And we didn't have all this wacky feat
and rank-based skills and sensible combat nonsense.  We had non-weapon
proficiencies and THAC0 and we liked it!  Now get off my lawn!" I
groused.  Rolling my eyes, I continued. "Anyway, fine,
whatever. Rogues, then.  As I was saying, we need to find the
best <em>rogue</em> that we can and have him scout the Deorsi
encampment and steal whatever it is they're using for all this
spellcasting.  Thomas, after we're done here find out who the best
thie&ndash; <em>rogue</em> is among the specials and dispatch him for
that."
</p>

<p>
Thomas frowned.  "The High Marshal was quite clear that if we scout
them or take any other military actions towards them during the time
of the truce then he'll attack full force immediately.  Is it wise to
throw away the time advantage?"
</p>

<p>
I threw that thought into my newly-enhanced brain, spinning it
around.  <em>~Not thinking of that was a major error.  Why did it
happen, and how do I stop it happening again?  Was it a failure in
memory, or a failure in analysis?~</em> Experimentally, I reached for
some of my farther-back memories for details from years ago.  I needed
something highly precise, like the taste of the cheese that Suze had
served me for supper on my first day...now that I thought about it,
yes, I could relive that cheese in all its delicious glory.  Just like
I could remember the exact stippling on the cannon we hid behind at
the test shoot, from where fragments of the failed cannon had slammed
into it.  The memories were there, the problem was that I had to
decide what to retrieve; despite the enhancement, my mind didn't
automatically surface every possibly relevant item.
</p>

<p>In a way, that was reassuring; a failure in analysis, which this
clearly had been, was fixable.  All I had to do was be more
meticulous.  Had it been a problem with basic memory, there would have
been no fixing that.
</p>

<p>"Good point, Thomas.  Thanks for reminding me.  Ok, prep the
infiltration mission but don't actually launch it.  Next item: can we
believe what they told us.  Thoughts, anyone?"  I looked around
expectantly.
</p>
 
<p>
Silence reigned for a moment.  Finally James spoke, clearly thinking
out loud as he did.  It was positively eerie how much he and Ryan were
alike; they even used the same open-handed gesture when they talked
through an idea.  "The High Marshal handled that
conversation...deftly. He greeted all of you by name, including
surnames.  He knew everyone's profession.  And everything he said was
calculated to demonstrate their strength and abilities."
</p>

<p>
We were all nodding, thoughtfully.  Then Mark took the ball from his
brother. "Like how he inquired about your age, M'Lord&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I growled in minor irritation.  "Call me Jake, all of you.  This
M'Lord crap gets old."
</p>

<p>
Around the circle, there were uncomfortable nods.  After a moment,
Ryan continued.  "Remember how he steered the conversation to your
age?  What if that was just a way of introducing his own age, and the
fact that they have readily available rejuvenation and personal
transformation magic, M'Lord?"
</p>

<p>
I flicked him a grumpy look and he hurried to correct himself.  "Er,
Jake.  Sorry M'L&mdash;sorry, Jake."  The poor guy looked about as
uncomfortable as a human could look and not actually melt into a
puddle of embarrassment goo.
</p>

<p>
I took a moment to grouse to myself.  <em>~These people stood in the
bathroom with me while I pooped.  How do you keep being all formal
with someone after watching them poop?~</em> Setting the thought
aside, I considered what Ryan was saying.  It made a worrisome amount
of sense.
</p>

<p>
"Yeah.  So the whole visit was a psyop; do you think the offer itself
was valid?"
</p>

<p>
They looked at me with that "huh?" look that I was already tired of.
"Psychological Operation&mdash;it was more about the subtext than the
actual words.  The main purpose was to intimidate us, more than to
actually demand our surrender.  But the real question is, was he being
honest about what Anundj&aring; is like, and the existence of the
undead threat?"
</p>

<p>
Ethan, a tall, whippet-thin man, spoke up. I didn't have much of a
read on him so far; he had barely spoken around me before.  "Odd
thing; they have a billion people, they have endless legions...yet
they send only a hundred thousand to conquer a country the size of
Flobovia?  We've got twenty eight million citizens; do they really
think they can maintain martial law over so many with so few?  If they
have the men, why not send more?  Or, if they can't spare the men from
the battle lines, then why are they here at all?"
</p>

<p>
It was a damn good question, and we all sat in silence for a good two
minutes pondering it.  After a time, Suze murmured
"<span style="font-size:4pt">Maybe they want something besides
land?</span>"
</p>

<p>
All eyes turned to her and she shrank into her seat as though she
hoped the earth would swallow her up.  "What was that, Suze?" I asked
as gently as I could, taking pains to look encouraging.
</p>

<p>
She cleared her throat and tried again, a bit louder.
"<span style="font-size:10pt">I was just thinking that maybe they want
something other than land?  They're sending patrols across the entire
country while the main body goes from one city to the next?  Maybe
they're searching for something?"</span>
</p>

<p>
I blinked in shock.  "They're sending patrols all over?  How do you
know that?  I didn't know that."
</p>

<p>
She hunched even further, ducking her head into her shoulders like a
turtle, her hands clasped in her lap.  "I'm sorry, M'Lord.  I just
wanted to help.  I spoke to the Sultan's Scry Corps, asked them for
the latest reports."
</p>

<p>
The 'Guard were all smiling widely at her, plainly trying to be
encouraging, but it didn't seem to be helping.  On consideration, I
suppose having the towering human cuisinarts smile widely at me
wouldn't necessarily be all that comforting either.  I hurried to
reassure her.  "No, no.  It's fantastic&mdash;thank you!  That could
be really important, and I didn't even know to ask for it.  I have a
feeling it's going to make a big difference in our planning.  You did
good, kiddo."  I kept laying the reassurance on thick, trying to get
her to calm down and relax.
</p>

<p>
"Oy, Suze!  Buck up!" hollered Allison from the fireplace.  I had to
suppress a start; once again, I had forgotten she was there.
"Straighten up and stop whispering!  These guys ain't so tough."
</p>

<p>
"Of course we are," said Ryan teasingly.  "We're the toughest sons of
bitches in the world.  Fortunately, Suze, we're <em>your</em> sons of
bitches.  Yours and Flobovia's; these mooks mess with our Land, we are
going to grind their bones into paste and make tasty sausages from
their entrails.  Tasty sausages which we will serve with parsley and a
nice white wine sauce.  Because everything is yummier with white wine
sauce."
</p>

<p>
She smiled a bit and her posture straightened just a smidge.  I made a
note to ask Thomas about what was up with her; her level of
nervousness made no sense to me.
</p>

<p>
James looked over at his brother with one eyebrow cocked.  "Entrail
sausages with white wine sauce?  Bro, we seriously need to work on
your concept of good cuisine."
</p>

<p>
Ryan affected a hurt expression.  "What?  White wine is delicious."
</p>

<p>
"It's not the wine, it's the meat.  Everyone knows you don't serve
white wine with red meat."
</p>

<p>
"Hey, I refuse to be stifled by the plebian tastes of the gustatory
unwashed.  My art must be free!"
</p>

<p>
James was opening his mouth to retort when Thomas gave a small,
deliberate <em>ahem</em>.  Immediately there was silence and all eyes
were on him.  "If we could perhaps table the culinary review for a
moment?  We might want to focus on the issue of stopping the entire
country from being enslaved."  Had the tone been any drier, you could
have used it as a dehumidifier.
</p>

<p>
Before continuing, he looked around the circle, staring us all down
and making sure we were focused. "Suze is right, their movement
patterns only make sense if they're searching for something, not just
trying to conquer us.  Another thing that doesn't ring true&mdash;why
were they so willing to give us a truce for a week?  With their
teleportation ability, why aren't they attacking immediately in order
to prevent another orbital strike?  They clearly understand the
importance of speed, and even after the deaths they still have enough
men."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe they know that we can't do another one?" offered Ryan.  "We
don't have any more of the Wrights; didn't you say we couldn't do the
strikes without them, M&mdash;Jake?"
</p>

<p>
I nodded absently, pondering the question.  There were no good
answers...or, rather, none of the answers were good.
