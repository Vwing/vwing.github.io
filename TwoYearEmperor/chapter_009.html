</p>

<hr />

<p>
The morning dawned with a lead gray sky glowering down, ready to drop
rain on us at any moment.  Despite that, the magi, apprentices, and
workers were all in the Plaza almost before the sun was fully up.
Apparently, word had gotten out about the cannon testing from last
night, because the crowd was even bigger than yesterday.  By
eleven'o'clock we had two companies of Landguard and seven companies
of regulars ringing the Plaza, holding back a solid press of citizens
who wanted a good view of this oddball yet fascinating spectacle.
</p>

<p>
And spectacular it was&mdash;even more workmen had come out than
yesterday, and progress was even faster; cannon barrels, cannonballs,
wires, and iron bars were practically flying out of the magi's hands,
only to be raced over to the next group for finishing.  A group of
ropemakers had shown up with a great innovation for making the
magnets: a pair of horizontal windlasses that mounted the bar between
them and then turned with a crank, allowing the wire to be fed on
rapidly and smoothly.
</p>

<p>
Things went great for the first few hours.  I stood out of the way and
watched, surrounded by ten Landguard and Thomas.  (Evidently the
Commander was feeling twitchy about how many people were gathered
around the Plaza and had decided to beef up my detail.)
</p>

<p>
Occasionally I would notice something that wasn't running quite right
and I'd either send a courier to resolve it or go myself.  Mostly it
was just a matter of unruffling some feathers; everyone was pushing
hard, and they didn't like it when someone else's slowdown interfered
with their own progress.  Overall, everything was surprisingly
smooth.  We even had a delicious lunch that was provided free of
charge by a consortium of the food vendors around the square.  All in
all, it was a great day.
</p>

<p>
And then it wasn't.
</p>

<p>
There were screams, wet chopping sounds, and people running in all
directions.  I couldn't see what was happening through the ablative
wall of chainmailed meat that surrounded me, so I started to push
forward.  Before I could see anything, though, I was bodily lifted off
the ground by two of my protectors who promptly accelerated away
toward the castle.  The others formed a solid scrum around us, facing
out with weapons in hand and maintaining position even while running
backwards.  (<em>~Oh right,~</em> a detached part of me
thought.  <em>~The Rules As Written give a running speed, but they
don't specify you must be running forwards.  Therefore, people can run
at the same speed forwards, backwards, or sideways.  Ah yes, the joys
of an underspecified reality.~</em>) These did not seem like exactly
the most useful thoughts I could be having at this exact moment, so I
tried to focus on what was happening around me instead.
</p>

<p>
Through a tiny gap in the line, I caught a glimpse of troops in
unfamiliar uniforms.  They were appearing near the ziggurat, weapons
drawn, and cutting a swath outward.  They came on like army ants, with
no apparent end to their numbers.
</p>

<p>
There was a phrase I'd read once, "a leemer is the feeling you get
when a shot of cold urine goes through your heart."  This moment was
exactly that feeling.  I didn't know how the Deorsi managed to
teleport this many troops here this fast, but if they got a beachhead
in the capital we were completely screwed.
</p>

<p>
"Stop!  Put me <em>down</em>!  We can stop them here!" I shouted,
struggling uselessly against the Landguard who held me suspended.
</p>

<p>
They hesitated just slightly, glances shooting back and forth.  Then I
was on my feet and Thomas was spinning me towards him, gripping my
shoulders intently.  "How?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"The cannon!  Get us to the cannon!"  I told him, pointing frantically
at the nearest.
</p>

<p>
They nearly ripped my arms off as they grabbed me, flashed to the
weapon, and set me back on my feet.  I didn't waste time trying to
load the thing; at the rate the enemy was emerging a single cannon
blast wouldn't do much more than create a break in the flow.  Instead
I grabbed a coil of the copper cable that was intended to connect the
generator to the cannon proper and waved at the generator itself,
"Grab that and come on!"  I started running as fast as I could towards
where the Deorsi were appearing.
</p>

<p>
Apparently the Landguard had decided that "in for a penny, in for a
pound" was the motto of the moment, because they didn't ask any
questions; Robert, Rob, Bob, Aerith, the goofy-haired one that was
outside my door when I had Duncan dungpiled, and three others that I
didn't recognize sheathed their weapons, grabbed the generator beween
them, and jogged (the best speed they could make while weighed down by
seven hundred pounds of iron and copper) after me.  Of course, "after
me" was right towards where a few hundred enemy soldiers were busily
chopping their way through everyone in reach.  My guys had brass balls
to be running straight at an armed enemy with no weapons in hand and
laden down by a load of metal, all without knowing why they were doing
it.
</p>

<p>
Even carrying the generator, the magic-augmented Landguard were still
faster than my Muggleriffic pace.  Thomas and Duncan grabbed me by the
arms again, lifted me off my feet, and carried me along like a
woodchip on a flood.  The rest of my Landguard protectors followed,
wrapping around us in a protective ring.
</p>

<p>
When we were as close to the enemy as Thomas was willing to let me
get, they set me on my feet and walled up in front of me.  
</p>

<p>
"Duncan, use your Decanter, soak the area!" I ordered, offering up a
silent prayer to whatever gods this world had that I had guessed right
and that Duncan's flask of magically appearing water was, in fact,
what I thought it was.  A Decanter of Endless Water is an amazingly
useful, amazingly broken, magical item. It does exactly what it says
on the tin&mdash;on command it produces an endless stream of water.
Depending on the command word used the water can be either fresh or
salt and can be produced at any of three rates ranging from "fill your
waterglass" up to "firehose."  One Decanter can be used to sustain an
army on the march, put out a small housefire, knock enemies over,
propel a small boat, excavate dirt, blast the holder a short distance
up into the air (useful for reaching second story windows, among other
things), and a ton of other uses limited only by one's Munchkinly
imagination,
</p>

<p>
Apparently, Decanters were standard issue for the Landguard (which I
thought showed excellent sense), because Duncan and five of the others
all pulled one out and started spraying toward the enemy.
</p>

<p>
A realization about basic chemistry hit me.  "Salt water, use salt
water!" I shouted.  They each spoke a word and the air was filled with
the smell of brine.
</p>

<p>
The Deorsi were aware of us now; dozens of them had wheeled and were
charging toward us in frighteningly perfect formation.  Behind them
another two dozen or so unlimbered bows and took aim.  More worrisome
was that beside the archers was a&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Mage!" shouted one of my protectors.  Instantly I was on the ground,
completely buried under Landguard bodies.  A powerful hand clamped
over my mouth and nose, cutting off all air.  Whoever was doing it
caught me on the exhale; I started thrashing, trying to get my face
clear so that I could get a breath, but the owner of that hand was
having none of it.
</p>

<p>
A moment later I was grateful; there was a boom-whoosh! like a gascan
blowing up and all the air was superheated and sucked away.  If I'd
been breathing it would have been yanked right out of my lungs,
ripping them up on the way.
</p>

<p>
A moment later the Deorsi infantry arrived en masse, shields set and
swords ready to kill us.  My protective meat-shield sprang up and
moved to stop them, leaving me free on the ground.  For a long moment,
I just lay on the ground watching the clash.  My mind was in a really
weird state &ndash; the back part of it was screaming, but the front
was ice calm.  This wasn't my usual calm-in-a-crisis-shaky-afterwards,
I could tell.  This situation was simply too far outside my experience
to register as real.  When it did, I was going to lose my calm in a
truly epic fashion, so I needed to be useful now.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, my bodyguard were far calmer than I was.  Bob and Aerith
turned their salty firehoses on the charging troops, knocking several
of them over and making others stumble.  It didn't damage them, but it
broke up their ranks so they hit our line in staggered bunches instead
in an overwhelming swarm.
</p>

<p>
And once there were holes in their ranks, the Landguard went through
those holes like a swarm of sharks.
</p>

<p>
There were too many of the Deorsi soldiers for Thomas and the others
to hold a line; the enemy would have wrapped around them and been free
to attack me.  Instead, the Landguard warriors went straight in,
flowing back and forth through the enemy lines and slaughtering every
enemy that came within reach.  It was like that scene in <em>Lord of
the Rings</em> where Aragorn gets his badass on and kills a few
bazillion orcs.  (Which scene?  Whatever, pick one.)  The Landguard
worked perfectly together, seeming to know at all times exactly where
each of their fellows was.  At one point I saw Aerith deliberately
turn his back on the enemy he was fighting and cut the legs out from
one who was trying to bypass him.  The first enemy wound up for a
killing blow&hellip;and then one of the 'Guards that I didn't
recognize passed by and took his head right off while moving on to
another target. At first I thought it was incredible luck, but then it
happened again.  And again.
</p>

<p>
It was rather like watching someone stumble into a deli slicer; armed
and armored Deorsi troops went in the front of the slicer and strip
steak medallions came out the back.  The term "flashing blades" is
overused in schlocky fantasy stories like the one I had somehow
stumbled into, but it absolutely did not apply here.  The blades of
the Landguard didn't "sing," they didn't "flash," they just moved
casually through the air, sliding around their opponent's guard with
contemptuous ease, and everyone they touched died.  Thomas and Duncan
did the most harm&mdash;every few seconds they each dropped three or four
Deorsi&mdash;but none of the Landguard were far behind.  
</p>

<p>
I had a sudden understanding of why the 'Guard were so stringently
bound to their duty and such an effective deterrant against armed
uprisings; this level of lethality was beyond my comprehension.  I was
sure it was utterly terrifying to those (such as the local nobles)
more familiar with it.
</p>

<p>
But as fast as they killed the attacking troops, more surged up from
behind.  And more Deorsi troops and magi were racing towards us,
recognizing that high-level characters were significant strategic
assets for their enemy and were therefore prime targets.  Glowing
spheres of force were beginning to strike, swerving between the
shifting ranks of the Deorsi to explode unerringly against Thomas.
The others weren't being hit, just the single most lethal man on the
Plaza.
</p>

<p>
<em>~Lovely</em>, I thought.  <em>~An enemy smart enough not to
divide their fire and numerous enough that we can't just stand and
kill them all.  Joy.</em> Forcing myself to my feet, I stumbled to
the coils of copper wire and hooked one end to the generator.
Grabbing an armful of the remainder, I dragged it towards where my own
personal human cuisinarts were busy making Deorsi-fritters and tossed
the cable into the dogfight.  It landed as a tangled loopy mess in the
big salty puddle that remained from our Decanter-enabled firefighting
efforts.
</p>

<p>
"Landguard, out of the water!  Bob, start cranking!" I shouted.
Without the slightest hesitation Bob spun on his heel, taking a nasty
cut in the process, and raced for the generator.  The others bounded
back, leaping out of the water and slamming together into a solid wall
that stopped the Deorsi butt-cold when they tried to follow.  Bob
raced to the generator, grabbed the handle, and started spinning it
like a pinwheel.  There was a crackling noise, the air reeked of
ozone, and all of the Deorsi troops standing in the water stiffened,
screamed, and dropped to the ground, thrashing as though in an
epileptic fit&hellip;or as though they were being electrocuted.
</p>

<p>
It was absolutely horrible; the cable was thrashing around like a
snake on a hot plate, sparks were flying everywhere, and I could smell
the delicious scent of sizzling bacon&mdash;which was suddenly
revolting instead of delicious.  I was pretty sure it would stay
revolting from now on, which utterly sucked because, damnit,
I <em>like</em> bacon.
</p>

<p>
The generator was doing a great job of dropping all the nearby enemies
to the ground and frying them, but in the process it had opened a
clear line of sight between us and the enemy wizards.  Until now
they'd been holding off on their primary face-smashing spells for fear
of hitting their own troops.  That was suddenly no longer a factor.
</p>

<p>
There were four of them and they stared at us like dire wolves eyeing
a sick caribou calf.  And then they all moved and things went
completely to hell.
</p>

<p>
The first cried "Dancing Lights!" and threw his arms up, tossing four
red balls of light into the sky, where they took up a rotating diamond
formation.  <em>~Probably a signal to every Deorsi soldier on the
continent to come stomp our heads in,</em> I thought to myself.
</p>

<p>
The other three wizards were not nearly so cute and fluffy.  Two
Fireballs and a Lightning Bolt came flying our way, catching all of us
in their blast.
</p>

<p>
I died.
