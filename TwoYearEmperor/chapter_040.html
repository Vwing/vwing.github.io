<em><strong>Author's Note</strong>:  Still don't own D&D.</em>
</p>

<p>
<strong><em>Minor trigger warning:</em></strong> The first few
paragraphs of this chapter have Duncan being...well, Duncan.  And
Albrecht, um, "having a bad day" as a result of his actions last
chapter.  It should still be safe for prime time, though.
</p>

<p>
<em>I forgot to mention: Back in March (2014, for you future readers),
<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1473338/Twylyte">Twylyte</a>
left a review of Chapter 35 where he figured out that Loki was playing
Jake. One of Jake's questions was "[Is it true that] the Deorsi have a
population of a billion people, at least thirty percent of whom are
under arms".  Loki's answer was "Yep, it's at least thirty percent,
maybe more"; Twylyte was the only one to notice that Loki was
carefully not answering the part of the question about their
population, and staked a guess that the Deorsi had nothing like the
population they had claimed.  Good on you, Twylyte!  In the fine
tradition of Stan Lee and Marvel Comics, I award you a +3
No-Prize!</em>
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Duncan blurred forward and kicked Albrecht in the groin so hard he
lifted off the ground; I actually <em>heard</em> his pelvis
shatter. The stout little general wheezed and collapsed into a fetal
ball, in too much pain to even whimper.  Duncan dropped to one knee
and started slamming carefully-aimed handstrikes down on him,
shattering joints, breaking fingers and nose...areas that would
disable and cause maximum pain without being life threatening.
</p>

<p>
"Duncan, stop!" I bellowed, pumping as much volume as I could in order
to tear through his rage.  I've got good lungs; everyone winced as the
confined space threw the sound back at us like a slap.
</p>

<p>
Duncan looked up, snarling.  "You said we couldn't hurt him unless he
betrayed us.  I'd say this counts!  Give me four minutes and the
little crapsack will be begging to open this place up for us."
</p>

<p>
"How about we find out exactly what he wants, first?  If we don't like
it, you can beat on him all you want.  Shoot, I'll hold him down for
you."
</p>

<p>
Duncan growled but stopped.  He climbed back to his feet,
"accidentally" grinding his foot down on Albrecht's groin in the
process.  I carefully failed to notice.
</p>

<p>
I took a knee next to Albrecht's head, casually leaning one arm on my
thigh.  "So, General L&ouml;fgren, this might be a good time for you
to tell us what exactly you're looking for with this alliance.  And,
if I may suggest, it would be a good idea if we liked it."
</p>

<p>
It was at least a minute before Albrecht could speak; we had to wait
for his testicles and major joints to regenerate before enough of the
pain slacked off for him to be coherent.  Eventually though, he
managed to gasp some words out.
</p>

<p>
"Inside left pocket...document...."  He promptly went back to panting
in ragged, agonized gasps.
</p>

<p>
Raising an eyebrow, I felt inside his jacket and retrieved the thick
sheaf of parchment I found there.  Breaking the wax seal, I skimmed
the first part quickly.  What I saw made me startle; I went back and
read it over more carefully.  Then read it again.
</p>

<p>
"What is this, a joke?" I demanded, snapping the document out towards
him.  "'The Union of Anundj&aring; is to become a Duchy of Flobovia,
coequal to all others, with High Marshal Albrecht L&ouml;fgren as
hereditary leader'?  You outmaneuver us on the battlefield, get a
peace treaty, capture us in your fortress, and now you want to
surrender and settle for being a Duke?"
</p>

<p>
"Not...Duke," Albrecht wheezed.  "Just leader.  With authority to
select...local government."  His voice was getting stronger, but was
still broken with pain.  "I and all citizens of Union to be...common
citizens of Flobovia.  Not asking for rights or privileges
of...nobility."
</p>

<p>
I stared at him for a long moment, then burst out in grim laughter.
"Oh, very clever.  Very clever indeed, you little bastard."  Behind
me, Thomas and Duncan snarled.
</p>

<p>
"What?" muttered Franklin in confusion.
</p>

<p>
"He wants Anundj&aring; to be part of Flobovia," Duncan growled.
"meaning that its citizens are part of the Land.  More, he wants to
rule the place but still be a commoner so <em>he's</em> part of the
Land.  We would have to defend him and his treacherous goatlickers,
and we couldn't touch him."
</p>

<p>
"It's more than that," Thomas snarled.  "He's joining Flobovia in name
only.  The Union remains a single political entity under the nominal
control of the throne, but in practice it's too large and too far away
to govern directly.  He's the political leader, with the right to
appoint local government, meaning that their leadership will even
remain intact."
</p>

<p>
"What?!" gasped Franklin.  "No way in the Hells!"  Down the tunnel, I
heard other voices echoing the sentiment.
</p>

<p>
I held up a hand to cut off the discussion.  "I'm inclined to give it
to him.  From what I read in the Writ, a Duke cannot be removed from
his rulership short of treason or other high crimes.  But
treason&mdash;either by people or provinces&mdash;removes them from
the Land and means that the Landguard are free to act against them.
And either the ruler or the Commander of the Landguard can specify an
act as treasonous.  If we give him what he wants he has every
incentive to be as helpful and loyal as he possibly can, because
he <em>knows</em> that we'll be looking for a reason to declare him a
traitor."
</p>

<p>
I looked around at the grim and mulish expressions that surrounded me.
More than one of the Landguard were eying Albrecht as though measuring
him for a coffin.
</p>

<p>
I rose to my feet and turned to face the Landguard, spreading my hands
to show peace and reasonableness.  "Face it, folks," I told them.
"He's got us over a barrel here. The drauga have basically conquered
Anundj&aring;, a nation that was a lot bigger and more powerful than
Flobovia.  They're going to spread, and eventually they'll find
us&mdash;Flobovia, I mean.  We need to be there to protect it, which
means we have to get out of this tunnel.  The only way we're getting
out of this tunnel is with his ok, which he's only going to give if we
agree to his terms.  And <em>no</em>," I added, in a hurried attempt
to shut down the suggestion that eight separate mouths were opening to
offer, "we can't just torture it out of him.  If I were him, I would
have a duress password that meant 'go destroy the Portable Hole
completely so these guys can never get out no matter what.'"</p>

<p>
I paused, noticing something that I had been subconsciously aware of
for a while now.  "Also, feel that?  No air movement whatsoever.  I
don't know how they normally keep the air fresh, but whatever it is,
they aren't doing it here.  There's a limited amount of air in here,
and we might not even be able to break him before we all suffocate."
</p>

<p>
Eight separate mouths closed with a frustrated clop.
</p>

<p>
I turned back to the whimpering man at my feet.  "Ok, L&ouml;fgren.
Let's say I sign this.  Then what happens?"
</p>

<p>
His ring had regenerated most of the major damage by now, but it was
still working on the fiddly bits, so he remained curled up on the
floor, gasping in pain.  When I questioned him, he made an obvious
effort to uncurl and drag himself up until he was sitting with his
back against the wall. (Which, I realized in a moment of distraction,
was literally the wall of the <em>universe</em>, since that's what
this extradimensional space effectively was.  Man, that was freaky!)
He still couldn't sit fully straight, but it was a less disempowering
position for negotiation.
</p>

<p>
"If you keep reading, you'll see that it appoints me Strategos of all
Flobovian military forces for the duration of the conflict with the
drauga," he responded, once he'd caught his breath.  "Our roles are
clearly defined: you set overall goals, I determine strategy; I'll be
leaning heavily on you for tactics, but miltary command is mine.
After we defeat the drauga I step down and full command reverts to
you.  Outside of those roles, I'm under your orders."
</p>

<p>
He glanced around at the thunderous expressions on the faces of the
Landguard, then focused on the thoughtful one that I was wearing.  "In
more immediate terms, I'll have Brandt re-open this segment, and I'll
place all of our resources under your authority, including all of our
remaining High Magi, High Clerics, and troops.  In particular, what
ability we have to resurrect people will be at your disposal, so you
can start to recover some of your fallen.  Also, I'll put you in touch
with the other Redoubts so that we can all coordinate.  Each Redoubt
is theoretically independent, but in practice what I say will carry a
lot of weight, so we can get a lot of their resurrection potential and
other magic working for you as well."
</p>

<p>
He wound down, clearly having exhausted his words.  Everything was on
the table now, the dice were spinning, and he was waiting to see if
I'd play the game or just have him killed.
</p>

<p>
I just stood there, arms folded, staring at him as I considered the
options.  After a moment, he spoke up again. "I swear to you, I will
serve loyally; all I care about is protecting my people."  His eyes
tracked over to Thomas.  "I am truly sorry that I had to do things
this way, Commander.  It would have been better in the long run if I
could have laid the situation out and come to an alliance through
simple negotiation.  I just couldn't take the chance."

<p>
He levered himself to his feet, grunting a little and leaning on the
wall for support.  Once upright, he took a couple of deep breaths,
then limped over to Thomas and tentatively extended his hand.
</p>

<p>
"I mean it when I say I'm sorry, Commander. This isn't the right way
to start an alliance, I know.  But Flobovia and Anundj&aring; need to
combine our resources if we're to have a chance, and I need to be
Strategos because, quite frankly, you don't have anyone nearly as good
as me."  He paused, searching Thomas's face for some sign of
understanding.  "These people are <em>my</em> Land, Commander.
I <em>cannot</em> and <em>will not</em> allow them to be harmed if
there is anything at all that I can do to prevent it.  Please, try to
think...what would you have done if our positions were reversed?  If
Flobovia had been ravaged the way Anundj&aring; has, and there was
another nation that could help protect your people?  Are my actions
truly so heinous, considered in that light?"  He stood there, hand
extended, waiting for Thomas's response.
</p>

<p>
Thomas's mouth worked as though he were chewing a lemon but,
eventually he had to shake his head.  He looked very obviously at
Albrecht's hand, then hooked his thumbs in his swordbelt and locked
eyes with the little general again, pointedly refusing to shake.  "No,
not so heinous.  But you're clearly willing to stab us in the back if
it suits your ends."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht waited another moment and then lowered his hand, looking a
bit sad as he did.  "Yes, if it would help defend my people then I
would cheerfully kill you all in your sleep.  But betraying
you <em>wouldn't</em> serve to defend my people.  Look at our
position: between the six remaining Redoubts we <em>might</em> have
ten million citizens left, more likely only seven or eight.  Of those,
maybe a quarter have some useful class levels, but most are only third
or fouth level.  We have five or six thousand High Magi and High
Clerics left&mdash;total, not six thousand of each.
</p>

<p>
"Those are our assets.  Consider our liabilities: we face
a <em>billion</em> foes.  Of those billion, I would estimate that
about forty percent have class levels; the enemy specifically targeted
those people in their initial attack.  They have forty or fifty very
powerful, very intelligent lichs as their overall leaders, along with
perhaps ten <em>million</em> High Priests and High Magi.  None of them
need to eat or sleep, so they have no supply lines for us to disrupt
and, like any modern army, their communication is mostly
point-to-point, through Sending spells or the like, so there's no real
way to disrupt their communications either.
</p>

<p>
"We aren't going to win this by force of arms, Commander.  We need
something outside the known possibility set, something that's never
been seen or thought of before.  Something that changes the rules of
the game.  You Landguard are the best troops we have left, and if Jake
can keep coming up with those otherwordly tactics and I can coordinate
them into an effective strategy, then we <em>might</em> be able to
turn this around."
</p>

<p>
He paused, confused by the snort of laughter that had erupted from me
and the ironic smile that was playing across Thomas's face.
</p>

<p>
"What? What's so funny?" he asked in bafflement.
</p>

<p>
I chuckled darkly.  "Thomas and I had this exact conversation, almost
word-for-word, when I first arrived, but we were talking
about <em>you.</em>  It's just funny to see the shoe on the other
foot.  Grim, but funny."
</p>

<p>
It took a moment, but he finally got the joke.  His lips twitched, but
he was too concerned about the situation to really feel like laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, Albrecht," I announced.  "I accept your proposal.  Anundj&aring;
will be integrated into Flobovia, you'll be appointed the non-noble
leader and Strategos, and we'll work together to keep us all alive.
My only proviso is that the Landguard remain under my orders, not
yours."
</p>

<p>
His face lit up like a Christmas tree; he reached into an inside
pocket...and then froze as every single one of the Landguard shifted
their weight forward and put their hands on their blades.  He raised
his free hand to show peaceful intent and then, very slowly, pulled
his right hand out from inside his coat.  In the tips of his fingers
was a quill pen, which he extended to me.
</p>

<p>
I took the pen and fiddled with it absently while quickly reading the
rest of the document to make sure there were no surprises.  There
weren't; Flobovia was to absorb Anundj&aring;, Albrecht was to become
Strategos&mdash;I quickly inserted the phrase 'of all non-Landguard
troops' in the margin&mdash;and non-noble ruler of the Anundj&aring;n
Duchy with full authority to appoint local government, create locally
binding laws, and so on.  The limits of our military authority were
defined exactly as he had stated&mdash;basically, I got to say 'go
kill all the bad guys' and then he, as Strategos, took it from there.
My mind caught on the word 'Strategos' for a moment; it seemed out of
place.  It was a Greek word, and stood out among the otherwise Nordic
language of Anundj&aring;.  Maybe an artifact of the translation
magic?  Or a foreign loan word?  I'd have to ask about that later when
we weren't quite so busy with the 'not dying.'
</p>

<p>
"Before you sign, Jake, two things," Albrecht said, carefully pitching
his voice to a 'calm and reasonable person' tone.
</p>

<p>
"Mmmh?" I muttered, still absorbed in the legal language.  
</p>

<p>
"First, that pen is a magic item&mdash;when you use it to sign the
treaty, it will put a Geas on you to adhere to the terms.  I'll sign
first; it will bind me just the same."  A ripping growl rose from
Duncan and Thomas's face froze; their eyes flicked to me for
permission to kill the stout little general.  Albrecht did a yeomanly
job of not noticing this and staying fixed on me.
</p>

<p>
"Second," he continued with commendable calm given how close he was to
death.  "If you're going to sign this thing, you really should choose
a title first.  When I introduce you to the leaders of the other
Redoubts, 'His Lordship' isn't going to impress them nearly as much as
something that fits in towards the top of a known
hierarchy&mdash;King, for instance."
</p>

<p>
I gave a disgruntled snort.  "Fine, signalling.  Blah blah, yes, I'm
cool because I have a special title, not because I can actually do
anything or know anything.  Whatever.  Here, sign it."  I shoved the
pen and the parchment into his hands.
</p>

<p>
Without hesitation, he pressed the parchment against the wall and
scrawled 'Albrecht L&ouml;fgren, High Marshal of the Union of
Anundj&aring;, Warden of the Marches, Thrice Crowned Defender of the
Nation.'  (Fortunately the "signature line" was actually a "freaking
huge signature box" so he could get all those titles in.)
</p>

<p>
As he lifted the pen, it flashed with a blue-green glow; the light
swarmed over his hand and up his arm, spreading to wrap around his
whole body.  It danced over him like foxfire for a long second before
sinking into his skin and fading away.
</p>

<p>
When he extended the pen to me, Thomas stepped in the way with a frown
so heavy you could have used it for an anvil.  
</p>

<p>
I cut him off before he could say anything.  "It's ok, Thomas.  This
needs to happen if we're going to protect the Land."  I couldn't
resist joking about it just a bit.  "And just think!" I caroled.
"Millions of new members of the Land, and all kinds of shiny new magic
and cool stuff!  Yay!"  He gave me a pursed-lip glare that spoke
volumes of disgust and irritation.  I just grinned puckishly at him
until he harumphed and got out of the way.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht handed me the pen and the treaty.  I stared at the parchment
for a long minute, tapping the pen on my cheek as I debated what to
write.  What title would work and would feel comfortable?  It wasn't
something I'd really thought about in the past.
</p>

<p>
Finally I shrugged; they wanted flowery and impressive?  Fine,
I'd <em>give</em> them flowery and impressive.  I pressed the
parchment up against the wall of the universe; I had a little trouble
writing against the curved surface, but I managed.  In thick letters,
I scrawled:
</p>

<p>
<center>His Imperial Majesty,<br />Emperor Jacob the First<br />Grand
High Technowizard of the Method Scientific<br />Lord of
Extradimensional Knowledge<br />Dedicated Browncoat<br />Master of
Code<br />Hoopy Frood<br />Have Spacesuit, Will Travel<br /></center>
</p>

<p>
The blue-green glow settled into my bones with the prickly feeling of
someone giving me a squinty-eyed "I'll be watching you!" look.  It was
enormously creepifying.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht took the paper, glanced at it, and then snapped off a salute.
"Welcome to Gr&#491;fhamr, Your Imperial Majesty!  A pleasure to have
you here.  Just a moment while I get us reconnected."  A bit of finger
twiddling, a few low words, and his smoke-trout thingy appeared,
then promptly vanished, presumably to reappear near Brandt in the
outside world.
</p>

<p>
"All set, Your Imperial Majesty!" he told me, sounding far too chipper
about the whole thing.  Yes, he had finished regenerating the damage
and was probably riding the 'mmm, these endorphins are delicious!'
train, but he still didn't need to sound so excited.  Also, I was
already regretting choosing 'Emperor'.  That 'Imperial Majesty' thing
was getting real old, real fast.
</p>

<p>
Albrecht gestured back up the tunnel.  "If everyone could just turn
around and head back the way we came, we should be connected up
again."
</p>

<p>
  <center>o-o-o-o</center>
</p>

<p>
Three hours later, I had had a tour of a reasonable segment of
Gr&#491;fhamr&mdash;enough to understand the way they lived,
anyway&mdash;and was now ensconced in what the Gr&#491;fhamrites
considered a 'private room': ten feet long, six feet wide, and ten
feet high.  The space was completely jam-packed with a triple bunk bed,
a triple-decker dresser, and a 'bathroom' two feet by three feet with
a chamber pot and relevant sanitary fittings, all of them miniaturized
and packed into the smallest space possible.  On the dresser was a
large basin and soap for bathing. (No wonder the residents had a bit
of whiff to them!)  Needless to say, the door opened out, since there
wasn't enough room for it to open in.
</p>

<p>
The most amazing thing about the room, of course, was that it was only
temporary.  Not temporary as in 'you will be assigned to another room
as soon as we finish changing the sheets.'  No, temporary as in 'this
place will cease to exist in a few hours, and if you're not outside
when it goes poof, you'll be dumped on your bum.'  
</p>

<p>
No, strike that.  The most amazing thing about this room was that it
really <em>was</em> palatial by the standards of Gr&#491;fhamr.
Having a private bathroom was almost unheard of, and sharing this much
space with only two other people was the lap of luxury.  There were
some rooms where people literally slept standing up, supported by
frames on the walls and packed in so close they were breathing each
other's sweat.
</p>

<p>
No, strike that again.  The most amazing thing was that these people
had been living like this for years now without all going crazy and
murdering each other.
</p>

<p>
This room, and the area around it, had been created by a spell, Mage's
Magnificent Mansion.  It was normally intended to create a palace
where a handful of friends could recline, relax, dine on fine foods,
be cared for by magically created servants, and generally feel like
kings.  Under the somewhat unusual requirements placed on the Deorsi
by the war, it had been repurposed to create housing for as many
people as could be physically packed in.  Bathing facilities were
shared, and mostly quite small.  The kitchen...well, there wasn't a
kitchen.  In the non-temporary area outside the Mansion there was a
spell engine that produced a steady supply of warm yellowish-brown
glop that fell into a trough and oozed down to a giant pot.  A steady
supply of runners, mostly children five and up, scooped up
cauldrons-full of this stuff and sprinted (or, in the case of the
younger kids, waddled) off to the far corners of Gr&#491;fhamr to
bring everyone their meals.  There simply wasn't enough room in the
corridors for everyone to come to a central dining area three times a
day, even in shifts.  For that matter, there wasn't enough room for a
central dining area.
</p>

<p>
Of course, that wasn't the only such spell engine.  Even at the
prodigious rate that the glop appeared, one engine couldn't support
the population.  There were others scattered throughout the complex,
and other teams of runners bringing it to other segments.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the various Mansions produced food along with space.  It
created enough delicious food to provide a lavish banquet for a
hundred-ish people; when you parceled that out into minimal meals, it
was enough to feed several hundred of the teeming millions.  Eating in
the Mansions was a reward for excellent service to the community, and
apparently a powerful motivator.  Everyone else ate the created glop.
</p>

<p>
After seeing all this, I was trying to think if it would be easier to
win the war or arrange for most of the people in Gr&#491;fhamr to be
killed off, because I really didn't want to share a room.
</p>

<p>
The most important part of the last few hours, of course, was the fact
that while I'd been nodding and smiling on the tour I had had some
time to think.  I had decided that yes, it would be better to leave
the remaining Landguard alive, so they could wallow in the misery of
all their friends being dead.
</p>

<p>
Actually, the word 'friends' wasn't sufficient to describe the bond
that the Landguard had with one another.  The Landguard were only
human&mdash;or human<em>oid</em> in some cases&mdash;in a genetic
sense.  In practice, they were much more like wolves: aggressive,
fiercely loyal to the people they cared about and to the Land they
guarded, and separated from the normal humans around them by their
duties and their capabilities.  I wondered how the world must look to
them; they were chosen because they were mentally and physically on
the far right edge of the bell curve to begin with, and then they were
enhanced far past human norms.  What must it be like to move through
the world so fast that normals appeared to be swimming in molasses?
To be so strong that everything around you was effectively made of
cardboard, and you had to constantly remember not to shake hands or
hug too tight, lest you break the squishy humans who were your charge?
I'm sure they had the 'Man of Steel, Woman of Tissue Paper' problem
too...their romances were probably mostly with other Landguard, and
there were far more male Landguard than female, meaning that most of
the men were constantly feeling somewhat, ah, blue in the nethers.
</p>

<p>
Yes, much better to leave them alive.  And with Isaac and Reynard
dead, I was content to leave Matthew alone; he was so non-dominant
that I doubted he'd been more than a pawn in my mind-surgery, if he
was involved at all.
</p>

<p>
My revenge was complete; it was time to finish this.
</p>	
<p>
"Guys, I need to use the facilities.  Step outside, please."
</p>

<p>
Thomas looked at me, flinty-eyed.  Duncan scowled.  After a moment,
though, they reluctantly stepped outside.  They didn't fully close the
door, and I heard the slither of steel as their blades came out, but
at least I had a modicum of privacy.
</p>

<p>
Stepping into the tiny bathroom, I closed the door and pulled the ring
with my carefully-hoarded final Wish out of my pocket.  I studied it
for a moment, considering the power locked up in this tiny bauble;
with a small shrug, I crushed it to dust and spoke firmly to the air.
</p>

<p>
"On the second night of my time in Flobovia, a mind-affecting magic
was used on me. I Wish for the effects of that magic to be undone."
</p>

<p>
An immaterial spear of golden energy lanced from the dust of the ruby,
spiking through my skull and deep into my brain.  Cleansing fire
blasted through every particle of my being, and I felt all the parts
of my mind shifting, realigning.  Doors that I had not realized
existed suddenly flew open and a flood of memories spilled out.  My
feelings, deadened without my knowledge, blossomed like a rose, and
every part of me reverted to what it had been originally...although,
unfortunately, I still had the enhancements and the perfect recall
that came with them.  All of my actions and thoughts since coming to
Flobovia flashed before my mind's eye, and I collapsed to my knees,
tears pouring from my eyes, an agonized scream ripping itself out of
me as I remembered.
</p>

<p>
Thomas ripped the door of the bathrom right off its hinges and scooped
me into his arms, backing into the corner by the bed as Duncan and
Robert blazed into position in front of us, blades out and ready to
destroy anything that threatened harm.
</p>

<p>
I barely noticed, too busy screaming and blubbering at the horror of
what I'd done.
